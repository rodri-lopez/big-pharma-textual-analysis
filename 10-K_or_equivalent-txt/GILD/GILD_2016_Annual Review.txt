42016 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
2016 marked strong performance for Gilead, particularly in our HIV and cardiopulmonary franchises. In HIV our continued
innovation, including the introduction of two new tenofovir alafenamide-based regimens, contributed to growth.
In liver disease, we navigated through the changing dynamics of the HCV treatment landscape, where we saw rapid uptake of
products after launch as patients who had been awaiting new options sought treatment, followed by a deceleration of demand
as that group completed treatment. This caused our HCV and total revenues to increase dramatically from 2013 to 2015 and then
decline in 2016. The significant revenue and cash flows generated from this franchise provide us with critical resources needed to
invest in our internal pipeline and external opportunities in order to create long-term shareholder value.

PRODUCT 28MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION
We contract with third parties to manufacture the majority of our active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs)
and drug products and our external supply chain continues to expand around the world. Our internal
manufacturing facilities are located in Foster City, San Dimas and Oceanside, California; Edmonton,
Alberta, Canada and Cork, Ireland.
Gilead’s suppliers for APIs and products must observe Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations as
designed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other relevant health authorities
worldwide. GMP covers all aspects of production: manufacturing procedures of dosage products and APIs
from the starting materials, premises and equipment to the training and personal hygiene of staff.

guidelines, eliminating the need
for additional temperature-
controlled packaging.
GREEN CHEMISTRY
As part of the lifecycle management of all products, there may be
opportunities to refine the process to achieve chemically equivalent
results while reducing or substituting out undesirable inputs such
as organic solvents. Limiting organic solvents helps lower Gilead’s
environmental impact since these solvents are typically derived
from nonrenewable sources and may have hazardous or toxic
properties. We have undertaken efforts to reduce the use of organic
solvents and other harmful substances from our manufacturing
process.
Gilead’s Process Research and Development team, including the
Commercial API Process Optimization (CAPO) group, based
in Foster City, California, and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, is
responsible for integrating green chemistry principles into the
design and development of chemical processes for
commercial APIs.
In 2016, Gilead evaluated new opportunities to use enzymatic
reactions and flow chemistry to reduce chemical processing steps
and improve product yields, while minimizing the environmental
impacts associated with manufacturing products.

SAFETY, LABELING
AND COMPLIANCE
Product safety is paramount at Gilead. Every
product goes through rigorous development,
testing and clinical trials phases. All Gilead
products are labeled and marketed pursuant to
governing policies and regulations. There were no
marketing or labeling violations in 2016 resulting
in a fine or warning.

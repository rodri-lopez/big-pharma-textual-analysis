COVER:
Katie has been living with HIV since she was an infant. Growing up in Maryland, she faced stigma at a very young age because of her disease.
Despite this experience, she maintains a positive outlook on life, which she credits to her supportive family and friends. Because she knows
first-hand the importance of support for people facing serious health challenges, Katie plans to devote her career to helping those in need.
She recently graduated from the University of Central Florida and aims to pursue a master’s degree in public health.
3DEDICATION: Stribild® Approved for HIV
Because of their effectiveness, safety profiles
and convenience, single tablet regimens have
become a standard of care for HIV. A single
HIV/AIDS AT tablet regimen combining the multiple drugs
required for HIV treatment helps ensure
patients take all of their medicine, avoiding
partial doses which can lead to resistance
to therapy. To this end, in 2012 we achieved
.A TURNING
a significant milestone: the approval by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
of Stribild, a fixed-dose formulation of
four Gilead medicines in a once-daily pill
POINT for treatment-naïve patients. It’s our third
single tablet regimen for HIV, joining Atripla®
and Complera,® which are among the most-
prescribed antiretroviral regimens in the
United States and Europe.
STRIBILD
New Tools for HIV Prevention
In July 2012, Truvada® became the first product
approved by FDA in combination with safer sex
practices to reduce the risk of HIV in uninfected
adults at high risk, a strategy called pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP). At the 2012 International AIDS
Conference—the largest gathering of scientists,
clinicians, public health experts and advocates
committed to eradicating the disease—a sense of
growing optimism prevailed. The approval of Truvada
for PrEP was noted as a milestone that could help
slow the spread of HIV in communities at greatest
risk, offering new hope for bringing the epidemic
under control. While great progress in diagnosis and
linkage to care for individuals with HIV has occurred
in the last several years, HIV prevention remains a
challenge around the world.
Jamie was diagnosed with HIV in 2008. In order to cope with
the fear he experienced at the time of his diagnosis, Jamie
educated himself extensively about the disease and worked
closely with his doctor to find the right treatment. With
his doctor’s encouragement, he began antiretroviral
therapy right away. Today, among many other interests, Jamie
maintains a passion for travel and the outdoors—recently
visiting a small fishing village in Mexico and Patagonia.

SOFOSBUVIR
Accelerating Clinical Development
Following the acquisition of Pharmasset in January
2012, we moved quickly to expand clinical testing
of hepatitis C therapies. Phase 3 trials exploring
sofosbuvir in various combinations with other agents
in genotype 1-6 patient populations are ongoing. In
2012, there were 21 new studies initiated, enrolling
more than 2,680 participants, and because of
patient and provider interest, we were able to
complete enrollment of some of these trials within
weeks. In addition to evaluating multiple hepatitis C
drug combinations in diverse genotypes and patient
populations, we are investigating ways to shorten
therapy from one year to a matter of weeks.
Edward Gane, MD, Professor of Medicine at the University
of Auckland, New Zealand, is a leading expert on treating
chronic hepatitis C. As the principal investigator of
the ELECTRON study of Gilead’s investigational agent
sofosbuvir, Dr. Gane is excited by the potential of all-oral
regimens that could make treatment more effective and
tolerable for patients.

Improving Patient Outcomes
At Gilead, we are developing new treatment
options that may target a range of cancers. We
are also exploring the utility of medications used
as combination therapy for diseases that are
among the most difficult to treat. Our work is
informed by a robust understanding of biology and
focuses on interrupting key pathways involved in
the formation and replication of cancerous cells.
Tessa St. Rose is a Clinical Research Coordinator at
Stanford University, where she helps people with serious
blood cancers enroll in research studies of investigational
therapies. Driven by the potential to help patients and their
families at a critical time, she sees her role as an essential
bridge between her patients and the often-complex clinical
trial process. Tessa works closely with her patients to
answer questions, explain research protocols and schedule
study visits—all important steps in the search to find new
treatments for today and in the future.

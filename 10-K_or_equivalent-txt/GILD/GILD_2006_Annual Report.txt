Hepatitis B and C
Viral infections caused by hepatitis B and C are growing in prevalence worldwide,
putting millions of people at risk of developing life-threatening liver disease and
cancer. While both viruses can lead to the development of an acute disease that can
be readily diagnosed, many people who contract the viruses develop chronic infec-

of awareness about how hepatitis B and C are transmitted, significantly contribute
to the spread of both diseases.

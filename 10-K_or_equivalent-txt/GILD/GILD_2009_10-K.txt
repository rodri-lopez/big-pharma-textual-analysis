PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we, us or our), incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987, is a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and
commercializes innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet medical need. Our mission is to advance the care of patients suffering from life threatening diseases
worldwide. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North America, Europe and Australia. To date, we have focused our efforts on bringing
novel therapeutics for the treatment of life threatening diseases to market. We continue to seek to add to our existing portfolio of products through our internal
discovery and clinical development programs and through an active product acquisition and in-licensing strategy.
In 2009, we acquired CV Therapeutics, Inc. (CV Therapeutics), a publicly-held biopharmaceutical company based in Palo Alto, California, primarily focused on
the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. CV Therapeutics had two marketed products,
Ranexa (ranolazine) and Lexiscan (regadenoson), as well as several product candidates in clinical development for the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic and
pulmonary diseases.

Commercialization and Distribution
We have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Our products are marketed through our commercial teams and/or in conjunction with third party distributors and corporate partners. Our commercial teams
promote our products through direct field contact with physicians, hospitals, clinics and other healthcare providers. We generally grant our third party distributors
the exclusive right to promote our product in a territory for a specified period of time. Most of our agreements with these distributors provide for collaborative efforts
between the distributor and Gilead in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for the product in the specified territory.
In the United States, our commercial team promotes Truvada, Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera, Letairis and Ranexa. We promote Atripla in the United States with our
joint venture partner, Bristol Myers-Squibb Company (BMS). We distribute Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera, Vistide and Ranexa in the United States
exclusively through the wholesale channel. Our product sales to three large wholesalers, Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Corp. and AmerisourceBergen Corp., each
accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. On a combined basis, these wholesalers accounted for
approximately 85% of our product sales in the United States and approximately 43% of our total revenues. Our corporate partner, Astellas, promotes, sells and
distributes AmBisome and Lexiscan for us in the United States. Cayston and Letairis are distributed exclusively by specialty pharmacies. These specialty pharmacies
specialize in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic conditions that may require a high level of patient education and ongoing counseling.
We sell and distribute Truvada, Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera and AmBisome in Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and New Zealand either
through our commercial teams, third party distributors or corporate partners. We promote Atripla jointly with BMS in the majority of countries in Europe and are
responsible for selling and distributing the product in these countries. In a limited number of Central and Eastern European countries, either Gilead, BMS or a third
party distributor is the sole promoting, selling and distributing company. Under an agreement with Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck), we promote and distribute Atripla in 12
countries in Latin America and Asia-Pacific either through Merck or our existing third party distributors. GSK promotes, sells and distributes Hepsera in Asia, Latin
America and certain other territories and plans to promote, sell and distribute Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in China. We rely on our corporate
partner, Japan Tobacco Inc., to promote and sell Truvada, Viread and Emtriva in Japan. Our corporate partner, Astellas, promotes, sells and distributes AmBisome in
Canada. Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd is responsible for promotion and distribution of AmBisome in Japan.
Access in the Developing World
Through the Gilead Access Program, established in 2003, certain of our HIV products are available at substantially reduced prices in 130 countries in the
developing world. We have developed a system of tiered pricing that reflects economic status (using gross national income—GNI—per capita) and HIV prevalence.
This approach allows us to price our therapies based on a country’s ability to pay. For example, if a higher HIV prevalence exists in a certain country, but the country
also has a relatively high GNI, the country would be moved to a lower price tier to accommodate higher burden of disease.
4Table of Contents
We also support many clinical studies through the donation of our products to help define the best treatment strategies in developing world countries. For
example, in November 2002, we entered into a collaborative agreement with the Medical Research Council (MRC) of the United Kingdom, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH
and GSK in connection with a clinical study conducted by the MRC on antiretroviral HIV therapy in Africa. The trial is called the DART (Development of
AntiRetroviral Therapy) study and is aimed at studying clinical versus laboratory monitoring practices and structured treatment interruptions on continuous
antiretroviral therapy in adults with HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. We provide Viread at no cost for the DART study.
We also work closely with the World Health Organization and with non-governmental organizations to provide AmBisome for the treatment of leishmaniasis, a
parasitic disease, at a preferential price in resource limited settings. We support numerous clinical studies investigating the role of AmBisome to treat visceral and
cutaneous leishmaniasis in developing countries through collaborations with organizations such as the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative and Médecins Sans
Frontières.
We have also entered into a number of collaborations related to access of our products in the developing world, which include:
• PharmaChem Technologies (Grand Bahama), Ltd (PharmaChem). In 2005, PharmaChem, one of our manufacturing partners, established a facility in
The Bahamas to manufacture tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viread and one of the active pharmaceutical
ingredients in Truvada and Atripla, for resource limited countries through a cooperative effort with PharmaChem and the Grand Bahama Port Authority.
• Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd (Aspen). In October 2005, we entered into a non-exclusive manufacturing and distribution agreement with Aspen,
providing for the manufacture and distribution of Viread and Truvada for the treatment of HIV infection to certain developing world countries included
in our Gilead Access Program. In November 2007, we amended our agreement with Aspen. Under the amended agreement, Aspen retained the right to
manufacture and distribute Viread and Truvada for the treatment of HIV infection in these developing world countries. Aspen has the right to purchase
Viread and Truvada in unlabeled bottles from us for distribution in such countries, and also has the right to manufacture Viread and Truvada using
active pharmaceutical ingredient that has been purchased by Aspen from suppliers approved by us. Aspen was also granted the right to manufacture
and distribute generic versions of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, including versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in combination
with emtricitabine for the treatment of HIV infection. Aspen is required to pay us royalties on net sales of Viread and Truvada, as well as royalties on net
sales of generic versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, including versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in combination with generic versions of
emtricitabine that are manufactured and distributed by Aspen.
• Generic Licenses. We have entered into non-exclusive license agreements with thirteen Indian generic manufacturers, granting them the rights to
produce and distribute generic versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for the treatment of HIV infection to 95 low income countries around the world,
which includes India and many of the low income countries in our Gilead Access Program. The agreements require that the generic manufacturers meet
certain national and international regulatory standards and include technology transfers to enable expeditious production of large volumes of high
quality generic versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In addition, these agreements allow for the manufacture of commercial quantities of both active
pharmaceutical ingredient and finished product.
• Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck). In August 2006, we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of Merck pursuant to which Gilead and Merck provide Atripla
at substantially reduced prices to HIV infected patients in developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America and Southeast Asia. Under the
agreement, we manufacture Atripla using efavirenz supplied by Merck, and Merck handles distribution of the product in the countries covered by the
agreement.
5Table of Contents
• International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM) and CONRAD. In December 2006, we entered into an agreement under which we granted rights to
IPM and CONRAD, a cooperating agency of the U.S. Agency for International Development committed to improving reproductive health by expanding
the contraceptive choices of women and men, to develop, manufacture and, if proven efficacious, arrange for the distribution in resource limited
countries certain formulations of tenofovir for use as a topical microbicide to prevent HIV infection.
Competition
Our products and development programs target a number of areas, including viral, fungal, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. There are many
commercially available products for the treatment of these diseases. Many companies and institutions are making substantial investments in developing additional
products to treat these diseases. Our products compete with other available products based primarily on:
• efficacy;
• safety;
• tolerability;
• acceptance by doctors;
• ease of patient compliance;
• patent protection;
• ease of use;
• price;
• insurance and other reimbursement coverage;
• distribution; and
• marketing.
Our HIV Products. The HIV landscape is becoming more competitive and complex as treatment trends continue to evolve. A growing number of anti-HIV
drugs are currently sold or are in advanced stages of clinical development. Of the approximately 32 branded HIV drugs available in the United States, our products
primarily compete with the fixed-dose combination products in the nucleotide/nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) class, including Combivir
(lamivudine/zidovudine), Epzicom/Kivexa (abacavir/lamivudine) and Trizivir (abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine), each sold by a joint venture established in November
2009 by GSK and Pfizer focused on HIV therapies. Other HIV products compete directly with products in the same NRTI class sold by BMS, although our HIV
products also compete broadly with HIV products from Abbott Laboratories, Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Merck, Pfizer, Roche and Tibotec Therapeutics.
BMS’s Videx EC (didanosine, ddI) became the first generic HIV product in the United States in 2004. GSK’s Retrovir (zidovudine) also faces generic
competition in the United States as a result of the launch of generic zidovudine in 2005. BMS’s Zerit (stavudine) also faces generic competition in the United States
as a result of the launch of generic stavudine in 2008. To date, there has been little impact from generic didanosine, zidovudine or stavudine on the price of our HIV
products; however, price decreases for all HIV products may result in the longer term.
In May 2010, the compound patent covering Epivir (lamivudine) itself will expire. Lamivudine is marketed by the joint venture established by GSK and Pfizer
and is competitive with emtricitabine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Emtriva and a component of both Truvada and Atripla. Certain third party payors or
plans may use the entry of generic lamivudine as a reason to exert pricing pressure on our HIV products.
6Table of Contents
AmBisome. AmBisome faces strong competition from several current and expected competitors. Competition from these current and expected competitors may
erode the revenues we receive from sales of AmBisome. AmBisome faces competition from Vfend (voriconazole) developed by Pfizer and caspofungin, a product
developed by Merck that is marketed as Cancidas in the United States and as Caspofungin elsewhere. AmBisome also competes with other lipid-based amphotericin
B products, including Abelcet (amphotericin B lipid complex injection), sold by Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the United States, Canada and Japan and by Zeneus
Pharma Ltd. in Europe; Amphotec (amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate complex for injection), sold by Three Rivers Pharmaceuticals, LLC worldwide; and Anfogen
(amphotericin B liposomal), sold by Genpharma, S.A. in Argentina. BMS and numerous generic manufacturers sell conventional amphotericin B, which also competes
with AmBisome.
We are aware of at least two lipid formulations that claim similarity to AmBisome becoming available outside of the United States, including the possible entry
of one such formulation in Greece. These formulations may reduce market demand for AmBisome. The manufacture of lipid formulations of amphotericin B is very
complex and if any of these formulations are found to be unsafe, sales of AmBisome may be negatively impacted by association.
Our HBV Products. Our hepatitis B virus (HBV) products, Hepsera and Viread, face significant competition from existing and expected therapies for treating
patients with chronic hepatitis B. Our HBV products face competition from Baraclude (entecavir), an oral nucleoside analogue developed by BMS and launched in the
United States in 2005, and Tyzeka/Sebivo (telbivudine), an oral nucleoside analogue developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Novartis) for sale in the
United States, the European Union and China.
Our HBV products also compete with Epivir-HBV/Zeffix (lamivudine), developed by GSK in collaboration with Shire Pharmaceuticals Group PLC and sold in the
major countries throughout North and South America, Europe and Asia.
Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B also compete with established immunomodulatory therapies, including Intron-A (interferon alfa-2b),
which is sold by Schering Plough Corporation in major countries throughout North and South America, Europe and Asia, and Pegasys (pegylated interferon alfa-2a),
an injectable drug similar to Intron-A sold by Roche for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.
Letairis. Letairis competes directly with Tracleer (bosentan) sold by Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (Actelion) and indirectly with PAH products from
United Therapeutics Corporation and Pfizer.
Ranexa. Ranexa competes predominantly with generic compounds from three distinct classes of drugs for the treatment of chronic angina in the United States,
including generic and/or branded beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and long-acting nitrates. In addition, surgical treatments and interventions such as
coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention can be another option for angina patients, and may be perceived by healthcare practitioners
as preferred methods to treat the cardiovascular disease that underlies and causes angina.
Vistide. Vistide competes with a number of drugs that also treat cytomegalovirus retinitis, including Cytovene IV and Cytovene (ganciclovir), sold in
intravenous and oral formulations by Roche and as an ocular implant by Bausch & Lomb Incorporated; Valcyte (valganciclovir), also marketed by Roche; Foscavir
(foscarnet), an intravenous drug sold by AstraZeneca PLC; and Vitravene (fomivirsen), a drug injected directly into the eye, sold by CibaVision.
Cayston. Cayston competes primarily with Tobi (tobramycin inhalation solution, USP), an inhaled medication sold by Novartis for the treatment of CF patients
whose lungs contain P. aeruginosa.
Tamiflu. Tamiflu competes with Relenza (zanamivir), an anti-influenza drug that is sold by GSK. Relenza is a neuraminidase inhibitor that is delivered as an
orally-inhaled dry powder. Generic competitors include
7Table of Contents
amantadine and rimantadine, both oral tablets that only inhibit the replication of the influenza A virus. BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing injectable
formulations of peramivir, an influenza neuraminidase inhibitor, for the treatment of influenza, which are currently in Phase 3 clinical trials.
Macugen. Macugen competes primarily with Visudyne (verteporfin for injection), which is sold by Novartis and used in connection with photodynamic
therapy, and Lucentis (ranibizumab), which is sold by Genentech, Inc.
Lexiscan. In the United States, there are numerous marketed generic and/or branded pharmacologic stress agents that compete with Lexiscan. Clinical Data,
Inc. is developing apadenoson as a pharmacologic stress agent for MPI which is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials. King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing
binodenoson, a pharmacologic stress agent currently in Phase 3 clinical trials. These product candidates could also compete with Lexiscan.
A number of companies are pursuing the development of technologies which are competitive with our research programs. These competing companies include
specialized pharmaceutical firms and large pharmaceutical companies acting either independently or together with other pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore,
academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection and may establish
collaborative arrangements for competitive products and programs.
Collaborative Relationships
As part of our business strategy, we establish collaborations with other companies, universities and medical research institutions to assist in the clinical
development and/or commercialization of certain of our products and product candidates and to provide support for our research programs. We also evaluate
opportunities for acquiring products or rights to products and technologies that are complementary to our business from other companies, universities and medical
research institutions. More information regarding certain of these relationships, including their ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business can be
found in Item 8, Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Commercial Collaborations
Although we currently have a number of collaborations with corporate partners that govern the manufacture, sale, distribution and/or marketing of our
products in various territories worldwide, the following commercial collaborations are those that are most significant to us from a financial statement perspective and
where significant ongoing collaboration activity exists.
• Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS). In December 2004, we entered into a collaboration with BMS to develop and commercialize the single tablet
regimen of our Truvada and BMS’s Sustiva in the United States. This combination was approved for use in the United States in July 2006 and is sold
under the brand name Atripla. We and BMS structured this collaboration as a joint venture by forming a limited liability company called Bristol-Myers
Squibb & Gilead Sciences, LLC. Under the terms of the collaboration, we and BMS granted royalty free sublicenses to the joint venture for the use of our
respective company owned technologies and, in return, were granted a license by the joint venture to use any intellectual property that results from the
collaboration. The economic interests of the joint venture held by us and BMS (including share of revenues and out-of-pocket expenses) are based on
the portion of the net selling price of Atripla attributable to Truvada and Sustiva, respectively. Since the net selling price for Truvada may change over
time relative to the net selling price of Sustiva, both our and BMS’s respective economic interests in the joint venture may vary annually. We and BMS
share marketing and sales efforts, with both parties providing equivalent sales force efforts at levels agreed to annually by BMS and us. The daily
operations of the joint venture are governed by four primary joint committees formed by both BMS and us. We are responsible for accounting, financial
reporting, tax
8Table of Contents
reporting and product distribution for the joint venture. In September 2006, we and BMS amended the joint venture’s collaboration agreement to allow
the joint venture to sell Atripla into Canada. The agreement will continue until terminated by the mutual agreement of the parties. In addition, either party
may terminate the other party’s participation in the collaboration within 30 days after the launch of at least one generic version of such other party’s
single agent products (or the double agent products). The non-terminated party then has the right to continue to sell Atripla and a short-term obligation
to pay royalties to the terminated party.
In December 2007, we entered into a collaboration with BMS which sets forth the terms and conditions under which we and BMS commercialize Atripla
in the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Either we, BMS or a third party distributor act as the selling party in these
countries and are responsible for, among other things, receiving and processing customer orders, warehousing product, collecting receivables and
handling returns. Manufacturing of Atripla is coordinated by us, and we are primarily responsible for distribution logistics. In general, the parties share
revenues and out-of-pocket expenses in proportion to the net selling prices of Truvada, with respect to us, and efavirenz, with respect to BMS. The
agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last-to-expire patent which affords market exclusivity to Atripla or one of its components in the
European countries covered by the agreement. Prior to such time, either party may terminate the agreement for any reason, with such termination to be
effective in December 2013. The non-terminating party has the right to continue to sell Atripla, but will be obligated to pay the terminating party certain
royalties for a three year period following the effective date of the termination. In the event the non-terminating party decides not to sell Atripla, the
effective date of the termination will be the date Atripla is withdrawn in each country or the date on which a third party assumes distribution of Atripla,
whichever is earlier.
• F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche). In September 1996, we entered into a development and license agreement
with Roche to develop and commercialize therapies to treat and prevent viral influenza. Tamiflu, an antiviral oral formulation for the treatment and
prevention of influenza, was co-developed by us and Roche. Under the original agreement, Roche had the exclusive right and obligation to manufacture
and sell Tamiflu worldwide, subject to its obligation to pay us a percentage of the net sales that Roche generated from Tamiflu sales. Under the
agreement, we received an up-front payment in the amount of $5.0 million and were entitled to receive additional milestone payments of up to $40.0
million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory objectives. We have received all such milestone payments. In October 1996, Roche
also made a cash payment to us in the amount of $5.3 million related to reimbursement for certain research and preclinical development expenses and our
obligation to prosecute and maintain certain patents under the agreement. In November 2005, we entered into a first amendment and supplement to the
original agreement with Roche. The amendment eliminated cost of goods adjustments from the royalty calculation, retroactive to calendar year 2004 and
for all future calculations. The amendment also provided for the formation of a joint manufacturing committee to review Roche’s manufacturing capacity
for Tamiflu and global plans for manufacturing Tamiflu, a U.S. commercial committee to evaluate commercial plans and strategies for Tamiflu in the
United States and a joint supervisory committee to evaluate Roche’s overall commercial plans for Tamiflu on a global basis. Each of the committees
consists of representatives from both Roche and us. Under the amendment, we have the option to provide a specialized sales force to supplement
Roche’s U.S. marketing efforts for Tamiflu, which we have not exercised to date. The agreement and Roche’s obligation to pay royalties to us will
terminate on a country-by-country basis as patents providing exclusivity for Tamiflu in such countries expire. Roche may terminate the agreement for
any reason in which case all rights to Tamiflu would revert to us. Either party may terminate the agreement in response to a material breach by the other
party.
• GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK). In March 2006, we sublicensed to GSK exclusive rights to market ambrisentan (the active pharmaceutical ingredient in
Letairis, which is marketed under the name
9Table of Contents
Volibris in territories outside the United States) for PAH in territories outside of the United States. Under the license agreement, we received an up-front
payment of $20.0 million and, subject to the achievement of specific milestones, we are eligible to receive total additional milestone payments of $80.0
million. Through December 31, 2009, we have received $42.5 million of such potential milestone payments. In addition, we will receive royalties based on
net sales of Volibris in the GSK territories. GSK has an option to negotiate from us an exclusive sublicense for additional therapeutic uses for Volibris in
the GSK territories during the term of the license agreement. Under the agreement, we will continue to conduct and bear the expense of all clinical
development activities that we believe are required to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for Letairis and Volibris in the United States, Canada and
the European Economic Area, and each party may conduct additional development activities in its territories at its own expense. The parties may agree
to jointly develop ambrisentan for new indications in the licensed field, and each party will pay its share of external costs associated with such joint
development. The agreement and GSK’s obligation to pay royalties to us will terminate on a country-by-country basis on the earlier of the date on which
generic equivalents sold in a country achieve a certain percentage of total prescriptions for the product plus its generic equivalents or the fifteenth
anniversary of commercial launch in such country. GSK may terminate the agreement for any reason. Upon such termination, all rights to the product
would revert to us. Either party may terminate the agreement in response to a material breach by the other party.
Research Collaborations
We currently have a number of collaborations with corporate partners that govern our research and development (R&D) of certain compounds and drug
candidates. The following research collaborations are those that are most significant to us from a financial statement perspective and where significant ongoing
collaboration activity exists.
• Japan Tobacco Inc. (Japan Tobacco). In March 2005, we entered into a licensing agreement with Japan Tobacco, under which Japan Tobacco granted us
exclusive rights to develop and commercialize elvitegravir, a novel HIV integrase inhibitor, in all countries of the world, excluding Japan, where Japan
Tobacco would retain such rights. Under the agreement, we are responsible for seeking regulatory approval in our territories and are required to use
diligent efforts to commercialize a product for the treatment of HIV infection. We will bear all costs and expenses associated with such commercialization
efforts. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid an up-front license fee of $15.0 million and are obligated to make total potential milestone payments of
up to $90.0 million upon the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and commercial objectives. Additionally, we are obligated to pay royalties based
on any net sales in the territories where we market the product. Through December 31, 2009, we have made total milestone payments of $12.0 million. The
agreement and our obligation to pay royalties to Japan Tobacco will terminate on a product-by-product basis as patents providing exclusivity for the
product expire or, if later, on the tenth anniversary of commercial launch for such product. We may terminate the agreement for any reason in which case
the license granted by Japan Tobacco to us would terminate. Either party may terminate the agreement in response to a material breach by the other
party.
• Tibotec Pharmaceuticals (Tibotec). In July 2009, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Tibotec, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Johnson & Johnson, under which we will develop and commercialize a fixed-dose combination of our Truvada and Tibotec’s non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor, TMC278 (25 mg rilpivirine hydrochloride), which is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials. Under the agreement, Tibotec granted us an
exclusive license to the combination product for administration to adults in a once daily, oral dosage form, worldwide excluding developing world
countries and Japan. Neither party is restricted from combining its drugs with any other drugs. We will pay Tibotec up to €71.5 million of Tibotec’s
development costs for TMC278 and are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and formulate the combination product, including
10Table of Contents
completion of bioequivalence studies. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded $52.4 million in reimbursable R&D expenses incurred by
Tibotec in the development of TMC278. Tibotec is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop TMC278 and obtain its approval in the
United States and Europe. We will manufacture the combination product and assume the lead role in registration, distribution and, subject to regulatory
approval, commercialization of the combination product in the licensed countries. Tibotec will have the right to detail the combination product in the
licensed countries, and, at its option, can request that it be the distributor of the combination product in a limited number of such countries. The price of
the combination product is expected to be the sum of the price of Truvada and the price of TMC278 purchased separately. The cost of TMC278
purchased by us from Tibotec for the combination product will approximate the market price of TMC278, less a specified percentage of up to thirty
percent.
Either party may terminate the agreement if the combination product is withdrawn from the market, if the other party materially breaches the agreement or
if certain clinical or regulatory conditions are not met. We may terminate the agreement in the United States and Canada on or after the expiration of the
last-to-expire patent for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the United States, and may terminate the agreement in any other country on or after the
expiration of the last-to-expire patent for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in a country of the European Union. Tibotec may terminate the agreement in the
United States and Canada on or after the expiration of the last–to-expire patent for TMC278 in the United States, and may terminate the agreement in any
other country on or after the expiration of the last-to-expire patent for TMC278 in a country of the European Union.
Research and Development
In addition to entering into collaborations with other companies, universities and medical research institutions, we seek to add to our existing portfolio of
products through our internal discovery and clinical development programs and through an active in-licensing and product acquisition strategy, such as with our
acquisitions of Myogen, Inc. and Corus Pharma, Inc. in 2006. In 2008, we acquired all of Navitas Assets, LLC’s assets related to its cicletanine business, which we are
evaluating as a potential treatment of PAH. In 2009, we acquired CV Therapeutics to further expand into the cardiovascular therapeutic area.
We have research scientists in Foster City, Palo Alto and San Dimas, California; Durham, North Carolina; and Seattle, Washington, engaged in the discovery
and development of new molecules and technologies that we hope will lead to new medicines and novel formulations of existing drugs.
Our product development efforts cover a wide range of medical conditions, including HIV/AIDS, liver disease, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease.
Below is a summary of our key product candidates and their corresponding current stages of development. For additional information on our development pipeline,

Patents and Proprietary Rights
Patents and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. If we have a properly designed and enforceable patent, it can be more difficult for our
competitors to use our technology to create competitive
12Table of Contents
products and more difficult for our competitors to obtain a patent that prevents us from using technology we create. As part of our business strategy, we actively
seek patent protection both in the United States and internationally and file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements in our
compounds, products and technology. We also rely on trade secrets, internal know-how, technological innovations and agreements with third parties to develop,
maintain and protect our competitive position. Our ability to be competitive will depend on the success of this strategy.
We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications and rights to patents related to our compounds, products and technology, but we cannot
be certain that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will result in issued patents.
The following table shows the actual or estimated expiration dates in the United States and Europe for the primary patents and for patents that may issue under
pending applications that cover the compounds in our marketed products:

(7) Application pending.
Patents covering the active pharmaceutical ingredients of Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera, Letairis, Vistide and Lexiscan are held by third parties.
We acquired exclusive rights to these patents in the agreements we have with these parties. Patents do not cover ranolazine, the active ingredient of Ranexa. Instead,
when it was discovered that only a sustained release formulation of ranolazine would achieve therapeutic plasma levels, patents were obtained on those formulations
and the characteristic plasma levels they achieve. Patents do not cover the active ingredients in AmBisome. Instead, we hold patents to the liposomal formulations of
this compound and also protect formulations through trade secrets. In addition, we do not have patent filings in China and certain other Asian countries covering all
forms of adefovir dipivoxil, the active ingredient in Hepsera. We do have applications pending in various countries in Asia, including China, that relate to specific
forms and
13Table of Contents
formulations of Hepsera. Asia is a major market for therapies for hepatitis B, the indication for which Hepsera has been developed.
We may obtain patents for certain products many years before we obtain marketing approval for those products. Because patents have a limited life, which
may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of the patent may be limited. However, we may be able to apply for patent
term extensions. For example, extensions for the patents on many of our products have been granted in the United States and in a number of European countries,
compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval. Similar patent term extensions may be available for other products that we are developing, but we
cannot be certain we will obtain them.
It is also very important that we do not infringe patents or proprietary rights of others and that we do not violate the agreements that grant proprietary rights to
us. If we do infringe patents or violate these agreements, we could be prevented from developing or selling products or from using the processes covered by those
patents or agreements, or we could be required to obtain a license from third parties to allow us to use their technology. We cannot be certain that, if required, we
could obtain a license to any third party technology or that we could obtain one at a reasonable cost. If we were not able to obtain a required license or alternative
technologies, we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products, and our business could be adversely affected. For example, we are aware of a
body of patents that may relate to our operation of Letairis Education and Access Program (LEAP), our restricted distribution program designed to support Letairis.
In addition, Actelion, which markets Tracleer, has applied for a patent that claims a method of use for ERAs for the treatment of IPF. If issued, this patent may
interfere with our efforts to commercialize our own ERA, ambrisentan, for IPF.
Because patent applications are confidential for a period of time until a patent is issued, we may not know if our competitors have filed patent applications for
technology covered by our pending applications or if we were the first to invent the technology that is the subject of our patent applications. Competitors may have
filed patent applications or received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that block or compete with our patents. If competitors file patent
applications covering our technology, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or litigation to determine the right to a patent. Litigation and
interference proceedings are expensive, such that, even if we are ultimately successful, our results of operations may be adversely affected by such participation in
such events.
Patents relating to pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology products, compounds and processes such as those that cover our existing
compounds, products and processes and those that we will likely file in the future, do not always provide complete or adequate protection. Future litigation or re-
examination proceedings regarding the enforcement or validity of our existing patents or any future patents could invalidate our patents or substantially reduce their
protection. For example, in 2007, the Public Patent Foundation filed requests for re-examination with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) challenging
four of our patents related to tenofovir disoproxil and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which is an active pharmaceutical ingredient in Truvada, Atripla and Viread. The
PTO granted these requests and issued non-final rejections for the four patents, which is a step common in a proceeding to initiate the re-examination process. In
2008, the PTO confirmed the patentability of all four patents.
Although we were successful in responding to the PTO office actions in the instance above, similar organizations may still challenge our patents in foreign
jurisdictions. For example, in April 2008, the Brazilian Health Ministry, citing the U.S. patent re-examination proceedings as grounds for rejection, requested that the
Brazilian patent authority issue a decision that is not supportive of our patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in Brazil. In August 2008, an examiner in
the Brazilian patent authority issued a final rejection of our fumarate salt patent application, the only patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate we have filed
in Brazil. We then filed an appeal within the patent authority responding to the questions raised in the rejection. In July 2009, the Brazilian patent authority again
rejected the application. This was the highest level of appeal available to us within the Brazilian patent authority. We have filed a civil action in Brazilian federal court
to
14Table of Contents
further appeal the action of the Brazilian patent authority. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding on our tenofovir disoproxil fumarate patent application.
If we are unable to successfully appeal the decision by the patent authority in the courts, the Brazilian government would likely purchase generic tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate, which would significantly reduce our sales of HIV products in Brazil. In 2009, the Brazilian government purchased approximately $50 million of our HIV
products. For 2010, we anticipate that purchases of our HIV products by the Brazilian government will be at a similar level.
As another example, the Patent Office of India initially allowed our claims covering tenofovir disoproxil and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. However, under
Indian civil procedure, prior to the official grant of allowed applications, several parties filed legal actions to protest the decision to grant the patents. In August 2009,
the Indian Patent Office announced that it had decided these actions against us and would not therefore allow the patents to be granted. We have filed an appeal
within the Indian Patent Office on both of these applications. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. If we are unable to successfully appeal these
decisions, any further appeals will have to be pursued in the Indian court system, and may ultimately prove unsuccessful. In the meantime, any competitor is able to
sell generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in India. In addition, if we are unable to successfully appeal any further negative decisions by the Indian Patent Office in the
Indian courts, these competitors would be able to continue to sell generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which could reduce the amount of royalties we receive from
our Indian generic licenses.
Our pending patent applications and the patent applications filed by our collaborative partners may not result in the issuance of any patents or may result in
patents that do not provide adequate protection. As a result, we may not be able to prevent third parties from developing compounds or products that are closely
related to those which we have developed or are developing. In addition, certain countries in Africa and Asia, including China, do not permit enforcement of our
patents, and third party manufacturers are able to sell generic versions of our products in those countries.
As part of the approval process of some of our products, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an exclusivity period during which other
manufacturers’ applications for approval of generic versions of our product will not be granted. Generic manufacturers often wait to challenge the patents protecting
products that have been granted exclusivity until one year prior to the end of the exclusivity period. From time to time, we have received notices from manufacturers
indicating that they intend to import chemical intermediates possibly for use in making our products. It is, therefore, possible that generic manufacturers are
considering attempts to seek FDA approval for a similar or identical drug through an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), which is the application form
typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug. If our patents are subject to challenges, we may need to spend significant resources to defend
such challenges and we may not be able to defend our patents successfully.
For example, in November 2008, we received notice that Teva Pharmaceuticals (Teva) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture
and market a generic version of Truvada. In the notice, Teva alleges that two of the patents associated with emtricitabine, owned by Emory University and licensed
exclusively to us, are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva’s manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Truvada. In December 2008, we
filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents. In March 2009, we received notice that Teva
submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Atripla. In the notice, Teva challenged the same two
emtricitabine patents. In May 2009, we filed another lawsuit against Teva in U.S. District Court in New York for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents, and this
lawsuit was consolidated with the lawsuit filed in December 2008. In January 2010, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting
permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Viread. In the notice, Teva challenged four of the tenofovir patents protecting Viread. In January 2010, we
also received notices from Teva amending its ANDAs related to Truvada and Atripla. In the notice related to Truvada, Teva challenged four patents related to
tenofovir and two additional patents related to emtricitabine. In the notice related to Atripla, Teva challenged four patents related to tenofovir, two additional patents
related to
15Table of Contents
emtricitabine and two patents related to efavirenz. We expect to file a lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the four Viread patents and two additional emtricitabine
patents. BMS and Merck have the rights to enforce and defend the patents related to efavirenz. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, and we may
spend significant resources enforcing these patents. If we are unsuccessful in these lawsuits, some or all of our original claims in the patents may be narrowed or
invalidated and the patent protection for Truvada, Atripla and Viread in the United States could be substantially shortened. Further, if all of the patents covering
those products are invalidated, the FDA could approve Teva’s request to manufacture a generic version of such products.
We also rely on unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented internal know-how and technological innovation. In particular, a great deal of our
liposomal manufacturing expertise, which is a key component of our liposomal technology, is not covered by patents but is instead protected as a trade secret. We
protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. These agreements provide that all
confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with us will be kept confidential and will not be used or
disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions made by an individual while
employed by us will be our exclusive property. We cannot be certain that these parties will comply with these confidentiality agreements, that we have adequate
remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. Under some of our R&D
agreements, inventions become jointly owned by us and our corporate partner and in other cases become the exclusive property of one party. In certain
circumstances, it can be difficult to determine who owns a particular invention and disputes could arise regarding those inventions.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
Our manufacturing strategy is to contract with third parties to manufacture the majority of our solid dose products. We also rely on our corporate partners to
manufacture certain of our products. Additionally, we own manufacturing facilities in San Dimas, California; Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; and Cork, Ireland, where we
manufacture certain products and active pharmaceutical ingredients for clinical and commercial uses.
We contract with third parties to manufacture certain products for clinical and commercial purposes, including Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera,
Ranexa, Vistide and Cayston. We use multiple third party contract manufacturers to manufacture tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in
Viread and one of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in Truvada and Atripla; and emtricitabine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Emtriva and one of the
active pharmaceutical ingredients in Truvada and Atripla. We rely on a single third party manufacturer to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients of
Vistide, Ranexa and Cayston. The diluent for Cayston is also manufactured by a single manufacturer at a single site.
We also rely on third party contract manufacturers to tablet or capsulate products. For example, we use multiple third party contract manufacturers to tablet
Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera and Ranexa. Emtriva capsulation is also completed by third party contract manufacturers. We rely on a single third party supplier to
tablet Emtriva and Letairis.
We also have manufacturing agreements with many of our corporate partners. Roche, by itself and through third parties, is responsible for the manufacturing
of Tamiflu. Under our agreement with Roche, through a joint manufacturing committee composed of representatives from Roche and us, we have the opportunity to
review Roche’s existing manufacturing capacity for Tamiflu and global plans for manufacturing Tamiflu. Astellas, our corporate partner for Lexiscan in America, is
responsible for the commercial manufacture and supply of product in United States and is dependent on a single supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of
Lexiscan. PARI Pharma GmbH is responsible for the manufacturing of the device required to administer Cayston to the lungs of patients. This device is made by a
single supplier at a single site.
At our San Dimas facility, we manufacture, fill and package products. We manufacture AmBisome and Cayston exclusively at this facility. We depend on a
single supplier for high quality cholesterol, which is used in
16Table of Contents
the manufacture of AmBisome. We fill and finish Macugen exclusively at our facilities in San Dimas under our manufacturing agreements with Eyetech and Pfizer.
Eyetech currently provides us with pegaptanib sodium, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Macugen. We also fill and package drug product for Truvada, Atripla,
Viread, Emtriva Hepsera and Ranexa in their finished forms at our facilities in San Dimas.
At our Edmonton, Alberta facility, we carry out process research and scale-up of our clinical development candidates, manufacture active pharmaceutical
ingredients for both investigational and commercial products and conduct chemical development activities to improve existing commercial manufacturing processes.
In addition, we utilize this site for the manufacture of emtricitabine. We also manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients in Letairis and Hepsera exclusively at
our Edmonton site, although another supplier is qualified to make the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Letairis.
We fill and package drug product for Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Emtriva, Cayston and Hepsera in their finished forms at our facilities in Cork, Ireland. We also
perform quality control testing, final labeling and packaging of AmBisome and distribution of many of our products for the European Union and elsewhere at this
facility. We utilize our Cork, Ireland facility primarily for solid dose tablet manufacturing of certain of our antiviral products, as well as product packaging activities.
The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not
comply with regulations. We, our third party manufacturers and our corporate partners are subject to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, which are
extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards. Similar regulations are in effect in other countries.
Our manufacturing operations are also subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies. Additionally, our third party manufacturers and our corporate partners
are independent entities who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risks which are out of our control. If we or any of our third party manufacturers
or our corporate partners fail to perform as required, this could impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis or receive royalties or cause delays in our
clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. To the extent these risks materialize and affect their performance obligations to us, our financial results may be
adversely affected.
We believe the technology we use to manufacture our products is proprietary. For products manufactured by our third party contract manufacturers, we have
disclosed all necessary aspects of this technology to enable them to manufacture the products for us. We have agreements with these third party manufacturers that
are intended to restrict these manufacturers from using or revealing this technology, but we cannot be certain that these third party manufacturers will comply with
these restrictions. In addition, these third party manufacturers could develop their own technology related to the work they perform for us that we may need to
manufacture our products. We could be required to enter into additional agreements with these third party manufacturers if we want to use that technology ourselves
or allow another manufacturer to use that technology. The third party manufacturer could refuse to allow us to use their technology or could demand terms to use
their technology that are not acceptable to us.
We need access to certain supplies and products to manufacture our products. If delivery of material from our suppliers were interrupted for any reason or if
we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of raw materials used to manufacture our products, we may be unable to ship certain of our products for commercial
supply or to supply our product candidates in development for clinical trials. In addition, some of our products and the materials that we utilize in our operations are
made at only one facility. For example, because we manufacture AmBisome and Cayston and fill and finish Macugen exclusively at our facilities in San Dimas,
California, in the event of a disaster, including an earthquake, equipment failure or other difficulty, we may be unable to replace this manufacturing capacity in a timely
manner and may be unable to manufacture AmBisome, Cayston and Macugen to meet market needs. Problems with any of the single suppliers we depend on may
negatively impact our development and commercialization efforts.
17Table of Contents
For our future products, we will continue to consider developing additional manufacturing capabilities and establishing additional third party suppliers to
manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates to undertake clinical trials and to manufacture sufficient quantities of any product that is approved for
commercial sale. If we are unable to develop manufacturing capabilities internally or contract for large scale manufacturing with third parties on acceptable terms for
our future products, our ability to conduct large scale clinical trials and meet customer demand for commercial products will be adversely affected.
Seasonal Operations and Backlog
Our worldwide product sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality. However, our royalty revenues, which represented about 7% of our total
revenues in 2009 and consisted primarily of Tamiflu royalties, are affected by seasonality. Royalty revenue that we recognize from Roche’s sales of Tamiflu can be
impacted by the severity of flu seasons and product delivery in response to the H1N1 influenza pandemic.
For the most part, we operate in markets characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs. We do not believe that backlog information
is material to our business as a whole.
Government Regulation
Our operations and activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United
States, drugs are subject to rigorous FDA regulation. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the
testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. As a result of these regulations,
product development and product approval processes are very expensive and time consuming.
The FDA must approve a drug before it can be sold in the United States. The general process for this approval is as follows:
Preclinical Testing
Before we can test a drug candidate in humans, we must study the drug in laboratory experiments and in animals to generate data to support the drug
candidate’s potential benefits and safety. We submit this data to the FDA in an investigational new drug (IND) application seeking their approval to test the
compound in humans.
Clinical Trials
If the FDA accepts the IND application, the drug candidate can then be studied in human clinical trials to determine if the drug candidate is safe and effective.
These clinical trials involve three separate phases that often overlap, can take many years and are very expensive. These three phases, which are subject to
considerable regulation, are as follows:
• Phase 1. The drug candidate is given to a small number of healthy human control subjects or patients suffering from the indicated disease, to test for
safety, dose tolerance, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
• Phase 2. The drug candidate is given to a limited patient population to determine the effect of the drug candidate in treating the disease, the best dose of
the drug candidate, and the possible side effects and safety risks of the drug candidate. It is not uncommon for a drug candidate that appears promising
in Phase 1 clinical trials to fail in the more rigorous Phase 2 clinical trials.
• Phase 3. If a drug candidate appears to be effective and safe in Phase 2 clinical trials, Phase 3 clinical trials are commenced to confirm those results.
Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted over a longer term,
18Table of Contents
involve a significantly larger population, are conducted at numerous sites in different geographic regions and are carefully designed to provide reliable
and conclusive data regarding the safety and benefits of a drug candidate. It is not uncommon for a drug candidate that appears promising in Phase 2
clinical trials to fail in the more rigorous and extensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
FDA Approval Process
When we believe that the data from the Phase 3 clinical trials show an adequate level of safety and efficacy, we submit the appropriate filing, usually in the
form of an NDA or supplemental NDA, with the FDA seeking approval to sell the drug candidate for a particular use. The FDA may hold a public hearing where an
independent advisory committee of expert advisors asks additional questions and makes recommendations regarding the drug candidate. This committee makes a
recommendation to the FDA that is not binding but is generally followed by the FDA. If the FDA agrees that the compound has met the required level of safety and
efficacy for a particular use, it will allow us to sell the drug candidate in the United States for that use. It is not unusual, however, for the FDA to reject an application
because it believes that the drug candidate is not safe enough or efficacious enough or because it does not believe that the data submitted is reliable or conclusive.
At any point in this process, the development of a drug candidate can be stopped for a number of reasons including safety concerns and lack of treatment
benefit. We cannot be certain that any clinical trials that we are currently conducting or any that we conduct in the future will be completed successfully or within
any specified time period. We may choose, or the FDA may require us, to delay or suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that the patients are being
exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if the drug candidate does not appear to have sufficient treatment benefit.
The FDA may also require Phase 4 non-registrational studies to explore scientific questions to further characterize safety and efficacy during commercial use of
our drug. The FDA may also require us to provide additional data or information, improve our manufacturing processes, procedures or facilities or may require
extensive surveillance to monitor the safety or benefits of our product candidates if it determines that our filing does not contain adequate evidence of the safety and
benefits of the drug. In addition, even if the FDA approves a drug, it could limit the uses of the drug. The FDA can withdraw approvals if it does not believe that we
are complying with regulatory standards or if problems are uncovered or occur after approval.
In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each drug, we obtain FDA approval of the manufacturing facilities for any drug we sell, including those of
companies who manufacture our drugs for us. All of these facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. The FDA must also approve foreign
establishments that manufacture products to be sold in the United States and these facilities are subject to periodic regulatory inspection. Our manufacturing
facilities located in California, including our San Dimas facilities, also must be licensed by the State of California in compliance with local regulatory requirements. Our
manufacturing facilities located in Canada, including our Edmonton, Alberta facility, and our facilities located near Dublin and in Cork, Ireland, also must obtain local
licenses and permits in compliance with local regulatory requirements.
Drugs that treat serious or life threatening diseases and conditions that are not adequately addressed by existing drugs and for which the development
program is designed to address the unmet medical need may be designated as fast track candidates by the FDA and may be eligible for accelerated and priority
review. Drugs for the treatment of HIV infection that are designated for use under the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief may also qualify for an
expedited or priority review. Viread, Truvada and Atripla received accelerated approval and priority reviews. Drugs receiving accelerated approval must be monitored
in post-marketing clinical trials in order to confirm the safety and benefits of the drug.
Drugs are also subject to extensive regulation outside of the United States. In the European Union, there is a centralized approval procedure that authorizes
marketing of a product in all countries of the European Union (which includes most major countries in Europe). If this centralized approval procedure is not used,
approval in
19Table of Contents
one country of the European Union can be used to obtain approval in another country of the European Union under one of two simplified application processes: the
mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure, both of which rely on the principle of mutual recognition. After receiving regulatory approval through
any of the European registration procedures, separate pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required in most countries.
Pricing and Reimbursement
Successful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of governmental and third party payer reimbursement for the cost of such
products and related treatments. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally provide reimbursement. In
the United States, the European Union and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and
third party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and
therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. For example, a significant portion of our sales of the majority of our products are subject to significant
discounts from list price and rebate obligations. In addition, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing
and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our product
revenues and profitability. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations
related to Medicare, Medicaid and health care reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.
Legislative and regulatory changes to government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently in the United States
and foreign jurisdictions. There have been significant changes to the federal Medicare system in recent years in the United States that could impact the pricing of our
products. Under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, Medicare beneficiaries are able to elect coverage for prescription
drugs under Medicare Part D. The prescription drug program began on January 1, 2006 and although we have benefited from patients transitioning from Medicaid to
Medicare Part D since 2006, the longer term impact of Medicare Part D on our business is not clear, and the impact will depend in part on specific decisions regarding
the level of coverage provided for the therapeutic categories in which our products are included, the terms on which such coverage is provided, and the extent to
which preference is given to selected products in a category. Third party payers providing Medicare Part D coverage have attempted to negotiate price concessions
from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, discussions are taking place at the federal level to pass legislation that would either allow or require the federal
government to directly negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers or set minimum requirements for Medicare pricing. The increasing pressure to
lower prescription drug prices may limit drug access for Medicare Part D enrollees. Further, Medicare patients have to pay co-insurance, which may influence which
products are recommended by physicians and selected by patients. In addition to federal Medicare proposals, state Medicaid drug payment changes could also
lower payment for our products. To the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow Medicaid coverage and payment developments, the adverse
effects may be magnified by private insurers adopting lower payment schedules.
Both President Obama’s Administration and the United States Congress have made healthcare reform a top priority and have proposed reforms to extend
coverage to millions of uninsured Americans and to reduce the rate of growth in the costs of government-sponsored healthcare programs. Impending reform
legislation in Congress may include reducing the coverage and reimbursement of our products and additional healthcare reform costs being borne by pharmaceutical
and biotechnology companies, including us, which could have an adverse impact on our business.
In Europe, the success of our commercialized products, and any other product candidates we may develop, will depend largely on obtaining and maintaining
government reimbursement, because in many European countries patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. In
addition, negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization by 12 months or more.
20Table of Contents
Reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. In many international markets, governments control the prices of
prescription pharmaceuticals, including through the implementation of reference pricing, price cuts, rebates, revenue-related taxes and profit control, and expect
prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline over the life of the product or as volumes increase. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased
the amount of discounts required on our products, and we expect this to continue as countries attempt to manage health care expenditures, especially in light of the
global economic downturn. As new drugs come to market, we may face significant price decreases for our products across most of the European countries. We
believe that this will continue into the foreseeable future as governments struggle with escalating health care spending. As a result of these pricing practices, it may
become difficult to maintain our historic levels of profitability or to achieve expected rates of growth.
Government agencies also issue regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. In addition, from time to time, professional societies,
practice management groups, private health/science foundations and organizations publish guidelines or recommendations directed to certain health care and patient
communities. Such recommendations and guidelines may relate to such matters as product usage, dosage, route of administration, and use of related or competing
therapies and can consequently result in increased or decreased usage of our products.
Health Care Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback
laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business,
including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the increasing attention being given to them by law
enforcement authorities, it is possible that certain of our practices may be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from
knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursed drugs or
services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our sales and
marketing activities may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including
fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). If the government were
to allege against or convict us of violating these laws, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
On August 12, 2009, we received a subpoena from the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services requesting
documents regarding the development, marketing and sales of Ranexa. We have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with any related governmental
inquiry.
Compulsory Licenses
In a number of developing countries, government officials and other interested groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs for
HIV infection available at low cost. Alternatively, governments in those developing countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to
manufacture and sell their own versions of our products, thereby reducing our product sales. For example, in the past, certain offices of the government of Brazil have
expressed concern over the affordability of our HIV products and declared that they were considering issuing compulsory licenses to permit the manufacture of
otherwise patented products for HIV infection, including Viread. In July 2009, the Brazilian patent authority rejected our patent application for tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viread. This was the highest level of appeal available to us within the Brazilian patent authority. We have filed a civil
action in Brazilian federal court to further appeal the action of the Brazilian patent authority. If we are unable to successfully appeal the decision by the patent
authority in the courts, the Brazilian government would likely purchase generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which would significantly reduce our sales of HIV
products in Brazil.
21Table of Contents
In 2009, the Brazilian government purchased approximately $50 million of our HIV products. For 2010, we anticipate that purchases of our HIV products by the
Brazilian government will be at a similar level.
In addition, concerns over the cost and availability of Tamiflu related to a potential avian flu and H1N1 influenza pandemic have generated international
discussions over compulsory licensing of our Tamiflu patents. For example, the Canadian government may allow Canadian manufacturers to manufacture
and export the active ingredient in Tamiflu to eligible developing and least developed countries under Canada’s Access to Medicines Regime. Furthermore, Roche
has issued voluntary licenses to permit third party manufacturing of Tamiflu. For example, Roche has granted a sublicense to Shanghai Pharmaceutical (Group) Co.,
Ltd. for China and a sublicense to India’s Hetero Drugs Limited for India and certain developing countries. Should one or more compulsory licenses be issued
permitting generic manufacturing to override our Tamiflu patents, or should Roche issue additional voluntary licenses to permit third party manufacturing of Tamiflu,
those developments could reduce royalties we receive from Roche’s sales of Tamiflu. Certain countries do not permit enforcement of our patents, and third party
manufacturers are able to sell generic versions of our products in those countries. Compulsory licenses or sales of generic versions of our products could
significantly reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if generic versions of our products are imported into territories where we
have existing commercial sales.
Employees
As of January 31, 2010, we had approximately 3,852 full-time employees. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
Environment, Health and Safety
We seek to comply with all applicable statutory and administrative requirements concerning environmental quality and worker health and safety. We have
made, and will continue to make, expenditures for environmental compliance and protection. Such expenditures have not had, and are not expected to have, a material
effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
We are voluntarily assessing our greenhouse gas emissions, and have begun to take action to reduce such emissions, for example through establishing
employee commuter programs and evaluating the energy efficiency of our buildings. Various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration
to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the California Air Resources Board is in the process of drafting
regulations to meet state emissions targets. Based on current information and subject to the finalization of the proposed regulations, we believe that our primary risk
related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs. However, because we are not an energy intensive business, we do not anticipate being subject to a
cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that would likely to be material to our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
We are also subject to other federal, state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment. We use hazardous materials,
chemicals, viruses and various radioactive compounds in our R&D activities and cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials.
Certain misuse or accidents involving these materials could lead to significant litigation, fines and penalties.
Other Information
We are subject to the information requirements of the Exchange Act. Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.
Such reports, proxy statements and other information may be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A
manifestation of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We note these factors
for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and, therefore, you should
not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.
A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales of our HIV products, particularly Truvada and Atripla. If we are unable to maintain or continue
increasing sales of these products, our results of operations may be adversely affected.
We are currently dependent on sales of our products for the treatment of HIV infection, particularly Truvada and Atripla, to support our existing operations.
Our HIV products contain tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and/or emtricitabine, which belong to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. Were the treatment
paradigm for HIV to change, causing nucleoside-based therapeutics to fall out of favor, or if we were unable to continue increasing our HIV product sales, our results
of operations would likely suffer and we would likely need to scale back our operations, including our spending on research and development (R&D) efforts. For the
year ended December 31, 2009, Truvada and Atripla product sales together were $4.87 billion, or 69% of our total revenues. We may not be able to sustain the growth
rate of sales of our HIV products, especially Truvada and Atripla, for any number of reasons including, but not limited to, the following:
• As our HIV products are used over a longer period of time in many patients and in combination with other products, and additional studies are
conducted, new issues with respect to safety, resistance and interactions with other drugs may arise, which could cause us to provide additional
warnings or contraindications on our labels, narrow our approved indications or halt sales of a product, each of which could reduce our revenues.
• As our HIV products mature, private insurers and government reimbursers often reduce the amount they will reimburse patients for these products,
which increases pressure on us to reduce prices.
• A large part of the market for our HIV products consists of patients who are already taking other HIV drugs. If we are not successful in encouraging
physicians to change patients’ regimens to include our HIV products, the sales of our HIV products will be limited.
• As generic HIV products are introduced into major markets, our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected.
A portion of our pre-tax income is derived from royalty revenue recognized from sales of Tamiflu by Roche. If sales of Tamiflu were to decrease, our pre-tax income
will be disproportionately and adversely affected.
F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) markets Tamiflu worldwide for the treatment and prevention of influenza under a
royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. We recognized $392.7 million in royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 related to royalties received
from sales
23Table of Contents
of Tamiflu by Roche. Although such royalty revenue represented approximately 6% of our total revenues in 2009, it represented 11% of our pre-tax income during the
period. Roche’s Tamiflu sales have unpredictable variability due to their strong relationship with global pandemic planning efforts. Sales of Tamiflu increased sharply
in 2009 primarily as a result of pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. If sales of Tamiflu were to decrease, our royalty revenues will decrease and our pre-tax income
will decrease disproportionately. Any such decrease could be material and could adversely impact our operating results.
Our inability to accurately estimate demand for our products, as well as sales fluctuations as a result of inventory levels held by wholesalers, pharmacies and non-
retail customers make it difficult for us to accurately forecast sales and may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our financial results and
our stock price.
In 2009, approximately 85% of our product sales in the United States were to three wholesalers, Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Corp. and AmerisourceBergen
Corp. The U.S. wholesalers with whom we have entered into inventory management agreements make estimates to determine end user demand and may not be
completely effective in matching their inventory levels to actual end user demand. As a result, changes in inventory levels held by those wholesalers can cause our
operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sales to these wholesalers do not match end user demand. In addition, inventory is held at retail pharmacies and
other non-wholesale locations with whom we have no inventory management agreements and no control over buying patterns. Adverse changes in economic
conditions or other factors may cause retail pharmacies to reduce their inventories of our products, which would reduce their orders from wholesalers and,
consequently, the wholesalers’ orders from us, even if end user demand has not changed. For example, during the second quarter of 2009, the wholesalers increased
their inventory levels for Atripla and Truvada, while inventory levels for Viread decreased. In the third quarter of 2009, the wholesalers drew down on their inventory
such that inventory levels for Atripla and Truvada at the end of the third quarter were more consistent with the levels held during the first quarter of 2009. As
inventory in the distribution channel fluctuates from quarter to quarter, we may continue to see fluctuations in our earnings and a mismatch between prescription
demand for our products and our revenues.
In addition, the non-retail sector in the United States, which includes government institutions, including state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP),
correctional facilities and large health maintenance organizations, tends to be even less consistent in terms of buying patterns, and often causes quarter over quarter
fluctuations that do not necessarily mirror the purchasing patterns that can be seen within the retail sector. For example, in the first quarter of 2008, we observed large
non-retail purchases by a small number of state ADAPs that purchase centrally and have significant warehousing capacity. We believe such purchases were driven
by the grant cycle for federal ADAP funds rather than current patient demand, which tempered orders and our associated product sales, revenues and earnings in the
second quarter of 2008 as these organizations depleted their increased inventory levels established during the first quarter of 2008. We expect to continue to
experience fluctuations in the purchasing patterns of our non-retail customers which may result in fluctuations in our product sales, revenues and earnings in the
future.
We estimate the future demand for our products, consider the shelf life of our inventory and regularly review the realizability of our inventory. If actual demand
is less than our estimated demand, we could be required to record inventory write-downs, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and our
stock price.
If we fail to commercialize new products or expand the indications for existing products, our prospects for future revenues may be adversely affected.
If we do not introduce new products to market or increase sales of our existing products, we will not be able to increase or maintain our total revenues and
continue to expand our R&D efforts. For example, in December 2009, we announced our Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating darusentan for the treatment of resistant
hypertension did not achieve its co-primary efficacy endpoints and as a result of this outcome, we decided to discontinue the development of darusentan for the
treatment of resistant hypertension.
24Table of Contents
Approximately 45% of our product sales occur outside the United States, and currency fluctuations and hedging expenses may cause our earnings to fluctuate,
which could adversely affect our stock price.
Because a significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, we face exposure to adverse movements in
foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign
currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative value of such sales increases. Overall, we are a net receiver of
foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we
transact significant amounts of business.
We use foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in
the Euro. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency
fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. We cannot predict future fluctuations in the foreign currency
exchange rate of the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly against certain currencies and our hedging program does not sufficiently offset the effects
of such appreciation, our results of operations will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.
Additionally, the expenses that we recognize in relation to our hedging activities can also cause our earnings to fluctuate. The level of hedging expenses that
we recognize in a particular period is impacted by the changes in interest rate spreads between the foreign currencies that we hedge and the U.S. dollar.
We face significant competition.
We face significant competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, most of whom have substantially greater resources than we do. In
addition, our competitors have more products and have operated in the fields in which we compete for longer than we have. Our HIV products compete primarily with
products from the joint venture established by GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK) and Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) which markets fixed-dose combination products that compete with
Truvada and Atripla. In May 2010, the compound patent covering Epivir (lamivudine) itself will expire. Lamivudine, marketed by the joint venture established by GSK
and Pfizer, is competitive with emtricitabine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Emtriva and a component of both Truvada and Atripla. Certain third party payors
or plans may use the entry of generic lamivudine as a reason to exert pricing pressure on our HIV products.
For Hepsera and Viread for treatment of chronic hepatitis B, we compete primarily with products produced by GSK, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) and
Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Novartis) in the United States, the European Union and China. For AmBisome, we compete primarily with products produced
by Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck) and Pfizer. In addition, we are aware of at least two lipid formulations that claim similarity to AmBisome becoming available outside of
the United States, including the possible entry of one such formulation in Greece. These formulations may reduce market demand for AmBisome. Furthermore, the
manufacture of lipid formulations of amphotericin B is very complex and if any of these formulations are found to be unsafe, sales of AmBisome may be negatively
impacted by association. Letairis competes directly with Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (Actelion) and indirectly with PAH products from United Therapeutics
Corporation and Pfizer. Ranexa competes predominantly with generic compounds from three distinct classes of drugs, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and
long-acting nitrates for the treatment of chronic angina in the United States. Cayston competes with a product marketed by Novartis. Tamiflu competes with products
sold by GSK and generic competitors.
In addition, a number of companies are pursuing the development of technologies which are competitive with our existing products or research programs.
These competing companies include specialized pharmaceutical firms and large pharmaceutical companies acting either independently or together with other
pharmaceutical
25Table of Contents
companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection and
may establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs.
If significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates, our future sales may be reduced, which would adversely affect our results of
operations.
The data supporting the marketing approvals for our products and forming the basis for the safety warnings in our product labels were obtained in controlled
clinical trials of limited duration and, in some cases, from post-approval use. As our products are used over longer periods of time by many patients with underlying
health problems, taking numerous other medicines, we expect to continue to find new issues such as safety, resistance or drug interaction issues, which may require
us to provide additional warnings or contraindications on our labels or narrow our approved indications, each of which could reduce the market acceptance of these
products.
Our product Letairis, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2007, is a member of a class of compounds called
endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) which pose specific risks, including serious risks of liver injury and birth defects. Because of these risks, Letairis is available
only through the Letairis Education and Access Program (LEAP), a restricted distribution program intended to help physicians and patients learn about the risks
associated with the product and assure appropriate use of the product. As the product is used by additional patients, we may discover new risks associated with
Letairis which may result in changes to the distribution program and additional restrictions on the use of Letairis which may decrease demand for the product. For
example, since the launch of Letairis, cases of edema in certain patients taking Letairis have been reported. This information has recently been added to the product
label, which may negatively impact demand for the product.
If serious safety, resistance or drug interaction issues arise with our marketed products, including Letairis, sales of these products could be limited or halted by
us or by regulatory authorities and our results of operations would be adversely affected.
Our operations depend on compliance with complex FDA and comparable international regulations. Failure to obtain broad approvals on a timely basis or to
maintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products.
The products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation by the
FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. We are continuing clinical trials for Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva, AmBisome, Letairis,
Ranexa and Cayston for currently approved and additional uses. We anticipate that we will file for marketing approval in additional countries and for additional
indications and products over the next several years. These products may fail to receive such marketing approvals on a timely basis, or at all.
Further, our marketed products and how we manufacture and sell these products are subject to extensive regulation and review. Discovery of previously
unknown problems with our marketed products or problems with our manufacturing or promotional activities may result in restrictions on our products, including
withdrawal of the products from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we could be subject to penalties including fines,
suspensions of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products and criminal prosecution.
On September 27, 2007, President Bush signed into law the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, which significantly expanded the FDA’s
authority, including, among other things, to:
• require sponsors of marketed products to conduct post-approval clinical studies to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an
unexpected serious risk;
26Table of Contents
• mandate labeling changes to products, at any point in a product’s lifecycle, based on new safety information; and
• require sponsors to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for a product which could include a medication guide, patient package insert, a
communication plan to healthcare providers or other elements as the FDA deems are necessary to assure safe use of the drug, which could include
imposing certain restrictions on distribution or use of a product.
Failure to comply with these or other requirements, if imposed on a sponsor by the FDA, could result in significant civil monetary penalties and our operating
results may be adversely affected.
The results and anticipated timelines of our clinical trials are uncertain and may not support continued development of a product pipeline, which would adversely
affect our prospects for future revenue growth.
We are required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of products that we develop for each intended use through extensive preclinical studies and clinical
trials. The results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large-scale clinical trials. Even successfully completed
large-scale clinical trials may not result in marketable products. If any of our product candidates fails to achieve its primary endpoint in clinical trials, if safety issues
arise or if the results from our clinical trials are otherwise inadequate to support regulatory approval of our product candidates, commercialization of that product
candidate could be delayed or halted. For example, in December 2009, we announced our Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating darusentan for the treatment of resistant
hypertension did not achieve its co-primary efficacy endpoints and as a result of this outcome, we decided to discontinue the development of darusentan for the
treatment of resistant hypertension. In addition, we may also face challenges in clinical trial protocol design. If the clinical trials for any of the product candidates in
our pipeline are delayed or terminated, our prospects for future revenue growth would be adversely impacted. For example, we face numerous risks and uncertainties
with our product candidates, including elvitegravir, our novel HIV integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection; the fixed-dose regimen of Truvada and
TMC278 for the treatment of HIV infection; and ambrisentan for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), each currently in Phase 3 clinical trials that could
prevent completion of development of these product candidates. These risks include our ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable
results of our clinical trials, the need to modify or delay our clinical trials or to perform additional trials and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body
approvals. As a result, our product candidates may never be successfully commercialized. Further, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of
our product candidates if, for example, we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If these programs and others in our
pipeline cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. In addition, clinical trials involving
our commercial products could raise new safety issues for our existing products, which could in turn decrease our revenues and harm our business.
Due to our reliance on third party contract research organizations to conduct our clinical trials, we are unable to directly control the timing, conduct, expense and
quality of our clinical trials.
We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. We rely on independent third
party contract research organizations (CROs), to perform most of our clinical studies, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation,
pre-study visits, training, program management and bioanalytical analysis. Many important aspects of the services performed for us by the CROs are out of our direct
control. If there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our CROs, our clinical trials may be delayed. Moreover, in our regulatory submissions, we rely on
the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third party CROs. If any of our CROs’ processes, methodologies or results were determined to be invalid or
inadequate, our own clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals could be adversely impacted.

Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and potential future health care reforms.
Legislative and regulatory changes to government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently in the United States
and foreign jurisdictions. There have been significant changes to the federal Medicare system in recent years in the United States that could impact the pricing of our
products. Under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, Medicare beneficiaries are able to elect coverage for prescription
drugs under Medicare Part D. The prescription drug program began on January 1, 2006 and although we have benefited from patients transitioning from Medicaid to
Medicare Part D since 2006, the longer term impact of Medicare Part D on our business is not clear, and the impact will depend in part on specific decisions regarding
the level of coverage provided for the therapeutic categories in which our products are included, the terms on which such coverage is provided, and the extent to
which preference is given to selected products in a category. Third party payers providing Medicare Part D coverage have attempted to negotiate price concessions
from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, discussions are taking place at the federal level to pass legislation that would either allow or require the federal
government to directly negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers or set minimum requirements for Medicare pricing. The increasing pressure to
lower prescription drug prices may limit drug access for Medicare Part D enrollees. Further, Medicare patients have to pay co-insurance, which may influence which
products are recommended by physicians and selected by patients. In addition to federal Medicare proposals, state Medicaid drug payment changes could also
lower payment for our products. To the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow Medicaid coverage and payment developments, the adverse
effects may be magnified by private insurers adopting lower payment schedules.
Both President Obama’s Administration and the United States Congress have made healthcare reform a top priority and have proposed reforms to extend
coverage to millions of uninsured Americans and to reduce the rate of growth in the costs of government-sponsored healthcare programs. Impending reform
legislation in Congress may include reducing the coverage and reimbursement of our products and additional healthcare reform costs being borne by pharmaceutical
and biotechnology companies, including us, which could have an adverse impact on our business.
We depend on relationships with other companies for sales and marketing performance and revenues. Failure to maintain these relationships, poor performance
by these companies or disputes with these companies could negatively impact our business.
We rely on a number of significant collaborative relationships with major pharmaceutical companies for our sales and marketing performance in certain
territories. These include collaborations with BMS for Atripla in the United States, Europe and Canada; Roche for Tamiflu; and GSK for ambrisentan in territories
outside of the United States. In some countries, we rely on international distributors for sales of Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva and AmBisome. Some of these
relationships also involve the clinical development of these products by our partners. Reliance on collaborative relationships poses a number of risks, including the
risk that:
• we are unable to control the resources our corporate partners devote to our programs or products;
• disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of rights to technology developed with our corporate partners;
• disagreements with our corporate partners could cause delays in, or termination of, the research, development or commercialization of product
candidates or result in litigation or arbitration;
• contracts with our corporate partners may fail to provide significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if one of these partners fails to
perform;
• our corporate partners have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional products and may pursue
alternative technologies or products either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors;
28Table of Contents
• our corporate partners with marketing rights may choose to pursue competing technologies or to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our
products than they do to products of their own development; and
• our distributors and our corporate partners may be unable to pay us, particularly in light of current economic conditions.
Given these risks, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. If these efforts fail, our product
development or commercialization of new products could be delayed or revenues from products could decline.
Under our April 2002 licensing agreement with GSK, we gave GSK the right to control clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of Hepsera in
territories in Asia, Africa and Latin America. These include major markets for Hepsera, such as China, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. In November 2009, we entered
into an agreement with GSK that provided GSK with exclusive commercialization rights and registration responsibilities for Viread for the treatment of chronic HBV in
China. The success of Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic HBV in these territories depends almost entirely on the efforts of GSK. In this regard, GSK
promotes Epivir-HBV/Zeffix, a product that competes with Hepsera. Consequently, GSK’s marketing strategy for Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic HBV
may be influenced by its promotion of Epivir-HBV/Zeffix. We receive royalties from GSK equal to a percentage of GSK’s net sales of Hepsera and Viread for the
treatment of chronic HBV as well as net sales of GSK’s Epivir-HBV/Zeffix. If GSK fails to devote sufficient resources to, or does not succeed in developing or
commercializing Hepsera or Viread for the treatment of chronic HBV in its territories, our potential revenues in these territories may be substantially reduced.
In addition, Cayston and Letairis are distributed through third party specialty pharmacies, which are pharmacies specializing in the dispensing of medications
for complex or chronic conditions that may require a high level of patient education and ongoing counseling. The use of specialty pharmacies requires significant
coordination with our sales and marketing, medical affairs, regulatory affairs, legal and finance organizations and involves risks, including but not limited to risks that
these specialty pharmacies will:
• not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, patient data or safety complaints;
• not effectively sell or support Cayston or Letairis;
• not devote the resources necessary to sell Cayston or Letairis in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;
• not be able to satisfy their financial obligations to us or others; or
• cease operations.
We also rely on a third party to administer LEAP, the restricted distribution program designed to support Letairis. This third party provides information and
education to prescribers and patients on the risks of Letairis, confirms insurance coverage and investigates alternative sources of reimbursement or assistance,
ensures fulfillment of the risk management requirements mandated for Letairis by the FDA and coordinates and controls dispensing to patients through the third
party specialty pharmacies. Failure of this third party or the specialty pharmacies that distribute Letairis to perform as expected may result in regulatory action from
the FDA or decreased Letairis sales, either of which would harm our business.
Further, Cayston may only be taken by patients using a specific inhalation device that delivers the drug to the lungs of patients. Our commercial launch of
Cayston and ongoing distribution of Cayston are entirely reliant upon the manufacturer of that device. For example, the manufacturer could encounter other issues
with regulatory agencies related to the device or be unable to supply sufficient quantities of this device at the time of commercial launch or following a commercial
launch. In addition, the manufacturer may not be able to provide
29Table of Contents
adequate warranty support for the device after it has been distributed to patients. With respect to distribution of the drug and device to patients, we are reliant on the
capabilities of specialty pharmacies. For example, the distribution channel for drug and device is complicated and requires coordination. The reimbursement approval
processes associated with both drug and device are similarly complex. If the device manufacturer is unable to obtain reimbursement approval or receives approval at a
lower-than-expected price, sales of Cayston may be adversely affected. Any of the previously described issues may limit or further delay the commercial launch of
Cayston, which would adversely affect our financial results.
Our existing products are subject to reimbursement from government agencies and other third parties. Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement pressures
may reduce profitability.
Successful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of governmental and third party payer reimbursement for the cost of such
products and related treatments. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally provide reimbursement. In
the United States, the European Union and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and
third party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and
therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. For example, a significant portion of our sales of the majority of our products are subject to significant
discounts from list price and rebate obligations. In addition, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing
and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our product
revenues and profitability. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations
related to Medicare, Medicaid and health care reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.
In Europe, the success of our commercialized products, and any other product candidates we may develop, will depend largely on obtaining and maintaining
government reimbursement, because in many European countries patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. In
addition, negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization by 12 months or more. Reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability
to sell our products on a profitable basis. In many international markets, governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals, including through the
implementation of reference pricing, price cuts, rebates, revenue-related taxes and profit control, and expect prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline over the
life of the product or as volumes increase. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on our products, and we
expect this to continue as countries attempt to manage health care expenditures, especially in light of the global economic downturn. As new drugs come to market,
we may face significant price decreases for our products across most of the European countries. We believe that this will continue into the foreseeable future as
governments struggle with escalating health care spending. As a result of these pricing practices, it may become difficult to maintain our historic levels of profitability
or to achieve expected rates of growth.
Expenses associated with clinical trials may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price.
The clinical trials required for regulatory approval of our products, as well as clinical trials we are required to conduct after approval, are very expensive. It is
difficult to accurately predict or control the amount or timing of these expenses from quarter to quarter, and the FDA and/or other regulatory agencies may require
more clinical testing than we originally anticipated. Uneven and unexpected spending on these programs may cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to
quarter, and our stock price may decline.
30Table of Contents
Our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to protect our patents and other intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally.
We may not be able to obtain effective patents to protect our technologies from use by competitors and patents of other companies could require us to stop using or
pay for the use of required technology.
Patents and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. Our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to:
• obtain patents and licenses to patent rights;
• preserve trade secrets; and
• operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others.
If we have a properly designed and enforceable patent, it can be more difficult for our competitors to use our technology to create competitive products and
more difficult for our competitors to obtain a patent that prevents us from using technology we create. As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent
protection both in the United States and internationally and file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements in our compounds, products
and technology.
We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications and rights to patents related to our compounds, products and technology, but we cannot
be certain that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will result in issued patents. Patent applications
are confidential for a period of time until a patent is issued. As a result, we may not know if our competitors filed patent applications for technology covered by our
pending applications or if we were the first to invent the technology that is the subject of our patent applications. Competitors may have filed patent applications or
received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that block or compete with our patents. In addition, if competitors file patent applications
covering our technology, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or litigation to determine the right to a patent. Litigation and interference
proceedings are expensive, such that, even if we are ultimately successful, our results of operations may be adversely affected by such events.
From time to time, certain individuals or entities may challenge our patents. For example, in 2007, the Public Patent Foundation filed requests for re-examination
with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) challenging four of our patents related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which is an active ingredient in
Truvada, Atripla and Viread. The PTO granted these requests and issued non-final rejections for the four patents, which is a step common in a proceeding to initiate
the re-examination process. In 2008, the PTO confirmed the patentability of all four patents.
Although we were successful in responding to the PTO office actions in the instance above, similar organizations may still challenge our patents in foreign
jurisdictions. For example, in April 2008, the Brazilian Health Ministry, citing the U.S. patent re-examination proceedings as grounds for rejection, requested that the
Brazilian patent authority issue a decision that is not supportive of our patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in Brazil. In August 2008, an examiner in
the Brazilian patent authority issued a final rejection of our fumarate salt patent application, the only patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate we have filed
in Brazil. We then filed an appeal within the patent authority responding to the questions raised in the rejection. In July 2009, the Brazilian patent authority again
rejected the application. This was the highest level of appeal available to us within the Brazilian patent authority. We have filed a civil action in Brazilian federal court
to further appeal the action of the Brazilian patent authority. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding on our tenofovir disoproxil fumarate patent
application. If we are unable to successfully appeal the decision by the patent authority in the courts, the Brazilian government would likely purchase generic
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which would significantly reduce our sales of HIV products in Brazil. As another example, the Patent Office of India initially allowed our
claims covering tenofovir disoproxil and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. However, under Indian civil procedure, prior to the official grant of the allowed applications,
several parties filed legal actions to protest the decision to grant the patents. In August 2009, the Indian Patent Office announced that it had decided these actions
against us and would not therefore allow the patents to be granted. We have filed an
31Table of Contents
appeal within the Indian Patent Office on both of these applications. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. If we are unable to successfully appeal
these decisions, any further appeals will have to be pursued in the Indian court system, and may ultimately prove unsuccessful. In the meantime, any competitor is
able to sell generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in India. In addition, if we are unable to successfully appeal any further negative decisions by the Indian Patent
Office in the Indian courts, these competitors would be able to continue to sell generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which could reduce the amount of royalties we
receive from our Indian generic licenses.
In 2009, the Brazilian government purchased approximately $50 million of our HIV products. For 2010, we anticipate that purchases of our HIV products by the
Brazilian government will be at a similar level.
Patents do not cover ranolazine, the active ingredient of Ranexa. Instead, when it was discovered that only a sustained release formulation of ranolazine would
achieve therapeutic plasma levels, patents were obtained on those formulations and the characteristic plasma levels they achieve. Patents do not cover the active
ingredients in AmBisome. In addition, we do not have patent filings in China or certain other Asian countries covering all forms of adefovir dipivoxil, the active
ingredient in Hepsera. Asia is a major market for therapies for hepatitis B, the indication for which Hepsera has been developed.
We may obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained for those products. Because patents have a limited life, which
may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of the patent may be limited. However, we may be able to apply for patent
term extensions.
As part of the approval process of some of our products, the FDA granted an exclusivity period during which other manufacturers’ applications for approval
of generic versions of our product will not be granted. Generic manufacturers often wait to challenge the patents protecting products that have been granted
exclusivity until one year prior to the end of the exclusivity period. From time to time, we have received notices from manufacturers indicating that they intend to
import chemical intermediates possibly for use in making our products. It is, therefore, possible that generic manufacturers are considering attempts to seek FDA
approval for a similar or identical drug through an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), which is the application form typically used by manufacturers seeking
approval of a generic drug. If our patents are subject to challenges, we may need to spend significant resources to defend such challenges and we may not be able to
defend our patents successfully. For example, in November 2008, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture
and market a generic version of Truvada. In the notice, Teva alleges that two of the patents associated with emtricitabine are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be
infringed by Teva’s manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Truvada. In December 2008, we filed a lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the two
emtricitabine patents. In March 2009, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic
version of Atripla. In the notice, Teva challenged the same two emtricitabine patents. In May 2009, we filed another lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the two
emtricitabine patents, and this lawsuit was consolidated with the lawsuit filed in December 2008. In January 2010, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA
to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Viread. In the notice, Teva challenged four of the tenofovir patents protecting
Viread. In January 2010, we also received notices from Teva amending its ANDAs related to Truvada and Atripla. In the notice related to Truvada, Teva challenged
four patents related to tenofovir and two additional patents related to emtricitabine. In the notice related to Atripla, Teva challenged four patents related to tenofovir,
two additional patents related to emtricitabine and two patents related to efavirenz. We expect to file a lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the four Viread patents
and two additional emtricitabine patents. BMS and Merck have the rights to enforce and defend the patents related to efavirenz. We cannot predict the ultimate
outcome of these actions, and we may spend significant resources enforcing these patents. If we are unsuccessful in these lawsuits, some or all of our original claims
in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated and the patent protection for Truvada, Atripla and Viread in the United States could be substantially shortened.
Further, if all of the patents covering those products are invalidated, the FDA could approve Teva’s request to manufacture a generic version of such products.
32Table of Contents
Our success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.
In May 2009, we filed another lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents.
If we infringe the patents of others, we may be prevented from commercializing products or may be required to obtain licenses from these third parties. We may
not be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required license on reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain these licenses or alternative technologies, we
may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products. For example, we are aware of a body of patents that may relate to our operation of LEAP, our
restricted distribution program designed to support Letairis. In addition, Actelion, which markets Tracleer, has applied for a patent that claims a method of use for
ERAs for the treatment of IPF. If issued, this patent may interfere with our efforts to commercialize our own ERA, ambrisentan, for the treatment of IPF.
Furthermore, we use significant proprietary technology and rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect certain aspects of our
production and other technologies. Our trade secrets may become known or independently discovered by our competitors.
Manufacturing problems could delay product shipments and regulatory approvals, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
We depend on third parties to perform manufacturing activities effectively and on a timely basis for the majority of our solid dose products. In addition, Roche,
either by itself or through third parties, is responsible for manufacturing Tamiflu. The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and
regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. We, our third party manufacturers and our corporate partners are
subject to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record
keeping and quality standards. Similar regulations are in effect in other countries. Our manufacturing operations are also subject to routine inspections by regulatory
agencies. Additionally, these third party manufacturers and corporate partners are independent entities who are subject to their own unique operational and financial
risks which are out of our control. If we or any of these third party manufacturers or corporate partners fail to perform as required, this could impair our ability to
deliver our products on a timely basis or receive royalties or cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. To the extent these risks
materialize and affect their performance obligations to us, our financial results may be adversely affected.
Our ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize Cayston will depend upon our ability to manufacture in a multi-product facility.
Aztreonam, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Cayston, is a mono-bactam Gram-negative antibiotic that we manufacture, by ourselves or through third
parties, in multi-product manufacturing facilities. Historically, the FDA has permitted the manufacture of mono-bactams in multi-product manufacturing facilities;
however, there can be no assurance that the FDA will continue to allow this practice. We do not currently have a single-product facility that can be dedicated to the
manufacture of Cayston nor have we engaged a contract manufacturer with a single-product facility for Cayston. If the FDA prohibits the manufacture of mono-
bactam antibiotics, like aztreonam, in multi-product manufacturing facilities in the future, we may not be able to procure a single-product manufacturing facility in a
timely manner, which would adversely affect our commercial supplies of Cayston and our anticipated financial results attributable to such product.
We may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell our products, which would limit our ability to
generate revenues.
We need access to certain supplies and products to conduct our clinical trials and to manufacture our products. In light of the economic downturn, we have
had increased difficulty in purchasing certain of the raw materials used
33Table of Contents
in our manufacturing process. If we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of these materials or find suitable alternate materials in a timely manner, our
development efforts for our product candidates may be delayed or our ability to manufacture our products would be limited, which would limit our ability to generate
revenues.
Suppliers of key components and materials must be named in an NDA filed with the FDA for any product candidate for which we are seeking FDA approval,
and significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required. Even after a manufacturer is qualified by the FDA, the manufacturer must continue
to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with GMP. Manufacturers are subject to regular, periodic
inspections by the FDA following initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that the equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do
not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may suspend the manufacturing operations. If the manufacturing
operations of any of the single suppliers for our products are suspended, we may be unable to generate sufficient quantities of commercial or clinical supplies of
product to meet market demand, which would in turn decrease our revenues and harm our business. In addition, if delivery of material from our suppliers were
interrupted for any reason, we may be unable to ship certain of our products for commercial supply or to supply our products in development for clinical trials. In
addition, some of our products and the materials that we utilize in our operations are made at only one facility. For example, we manufacture AmBisome and Cayston
and fill and finish Macugen exclusively at our facilities in San Dimas, California. In the event of a disaster, including an earthquake, equipment failure or other
difficulty, we may be unable to replace this manufacturing capacity in a timely manner and may be unable to manufacture AmBisome, Cayston and Macugen to meet
market needs.
Cayston is dependent on three different third party single-source suppliers. First, aztreonam, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in aztreonam for inhalation
solution, is manufactured by a single supplier at a single site. Second, it is administered to the lungs of patients through a device that is made by a single supplier at a
single site. Third, the diluent for Cayston is manufactured by a single manufacturer at a single site. Disruptions or delays with any of these single suppliers could
adversely affect our ability to produce Cayston in adequate quantities to support our commercial launch of Cayston, and we cannot be sure that alternative suppliers
can be identified in a timely manner, or at all.
In addition, we depend on a single supplier for high quality cholesterol, which is used in the manufacture of AmBisome. We also depend on single suppliers
for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Vistide, Ranexa and Cayston and for the tableting of Emtiva and Letairis. Astellas US LLC, which markets Lexiscan in the
United States, is responsible for the commercial manufacture and supply of product in United States and is dependent on a single supplier for the active
pharmaceutical ingredient of Lexiscan. Problems with any of the single suppliers we depend on may negatively impact our development and commercialization efforts.
We face credit risks from our European customers that may adversely affect our results of operations.
Our European product sales to government-owned or supported customers in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are subject to significant payment delays due
to government funding and reimbursement practices. This has resulted and may continue to result in an increase in days sales outstanding due to the average length
of time that we have accounts receivable outstanding. Our accounts receivable in these countries totaled approximately $753.6 million as of December 31, 2009, of
which $289.4 million was more than 120 days past due based on contractual payment terms. Historically, receivables balances with certain government owned
hospitals accumulated over a period of time and were then subsequently settled as large lump sum payments. If significant changes were to occur in the
reimbursement practices of these European governments or if government funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from
these customers and our results of operations would be adversely affected. For example, at December 31, 2009, we had $100.8 million due from publicly-owned
hospitals in Greece. In the event that the Greek government defaulted on its debt, we may be unable to collect some or all of these amounts due.
34Table of Contents
Our product revenues and gross margin could be reduced by imports from countries where our products are available at lower prices.
Prices for our products are based on local market economics and competition and sometimes differ from country to country. Our sales in countries with
relatively higher prices may be reduced if products can be imported into those or other countries from lower price markets. There have been cases in which other
pharmaceutical products were sold at steeply discounted prices in the developing world and then re-exported to European countries where they could be re-sold at
much higher prices. If this happens with our products, particularly Truvada and Viread, which we have agreed to make available at substantially reduced prices to 130
countries participating in our Gilead Access Program, or Atripla, which Merck distributes at substantially reduced prices to HIV infected patients in developing
countries under our August 2006 agreement, our revenues would be adversely affected. In addition, we have established partnerships with thirteen Indian generic
manufacturers to distribute high-quality, low-cost generic versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to 95 developing world countries, including India. If generic
versions of our medications under these licenses are then re-exported to the United States, Europe or other markets outside of these 95 countries, our revenues would
be adversely affected.
In addition, purchases of our products in countries where our selling prices are relatively low for resale in countries in which our selling prices are relatively
high may adversely impact our revenues and gross margin and may cause our sales to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For example, in the European Union, we are
required to permit products purchased in one country to be sold in another country. Purchases of our products in countries where our selling prices are relatively low
for resale in countries in which our selling prices are relatively high affect the inventory level held by our wholesalers and can cause the relative sales levels in the
various countries to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and not reflect the actual consumer demand in any given quarter. These quarterly fluctuations may impact our
earnings, which could adversely affect our stock price and harm our business.
In some countries, we may be required to grant compulsory licenses for our products or face generic competition for our products.
In a number of developing countries, government officials and other interested groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs for
HIV infection available at low cost. Alternatively, governments in those developing countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to
manufacture and sell their own versions of our products, thereby reducing our product sales. For example, in the past, certain offices of the government of Brazil have
expressed concern over the affordability of our HIV products and declared that they were considering issuing compulsory licenses to permit the manufacture of
otherwise patented products for HIV infection, including Viread. In July 2009, the Brazilian patent authority rejected our patent application for tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viread. This was the highest level of appeal available to us within the Brazilian patent authority. We have filed a civil
action in Brazilian federal court to further appeal the action of the Brazilian patent authority. If we are unable to successfully appeal the decision by the patent
authority in the courts, the Brazilian government would likely purchase generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which would significantly reduce our sales of HIV
products in Brazil. In 2009, the Brazilian government purchased approximately $50 million of our HIV products. For 2010, we anticipate that purchases of our HIV
products by the Brazilian government will be at a similar level.
In addition, concerns over the cost and availability of Tamiflu related to a potential avian flu pandemic and H1N1 influenza have generated international
discussions over compulsory licensing of our Tamiflu patents. For example, the Canadian government may allow Canadian manufacturers to manufacture
and export the active ingredient in Tamiflu to eligible developing and least developed countries under Canada’s Access to Medicines Regime. Furthermore, Roche
has issued voluntary licenses to permit third party manufacturing of Tamiflu. For example, Roche has granted a sublicense to Shanghai Pharmaceutical (Group) Co.,
Ltd. for China and a sublicense to India’s Hetero Drugs Limited for India and certain developing countries. Should one or more compulsory licenses be issued
permitting generic manufacturing to override our Tamiflu patents, or should Roche issue additional voluntary licenses to permit third party manufacturing of Tamiflu,
those developments could reduce royalties we receive from Roche’s sales of Tamiflu. Certain countries do not permit enforcement of
35Table of Contents
our patents, and third party manufacturers are able to sell generic versions of our products in those countries. Compulsory licenses or sales of generic versions of
our products could significantly reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if generic versions of our products are imported into
territories where we have existing commercial sales.
We may face significant liability resulting from our products that may not be covered by insurance and successful claims could materially reduce our earnings.
The testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our commercial products, as well as product candidates in development, involve substantial risk of product
liability claims. These claims may be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others. In recent years, coverage and availability
of cost-effective product liability insurance has decreased. In addition, the cost to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims may exceed our
coverage. If we are unable to maintain adequate coverage or if claims exceed our coverage, our financial condition and our ability to clinically test our product
candidates and to market our products will be adversely impacted. In addition, negative publicity associated with any claims, regardless of their merit, may decrease
the future demand for our products and impair our financial condition.
Our assumptions used to determine our self-insurance levels could be wrong and materially impact our business.
We continually evaluate our levels of self-insurance based on historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial
assumptions. However, if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends, our business, financial results and financial condition
could be materially impacted by claims and other expenses.
Expensive litigation and government investigations may reduce our earnings.
In November 2008, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of
Truvada. In the notice, Teva alleges that two of the patents associated with emtricitabine are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva’s
manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Truvada. In December 2008, we filed a lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents. In
March 2009, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Atripla. In the
notice, Teva challenged the same two emtricitabine patents. In May 2009, we filed another lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents, and
this lawsuit was consolidated with the lawsuit filed in December 2008. In January 2010, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting
permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Viread. In the notice, Teva challenged four of the tenofovir patents protecting Viread. In January 2010, we
also received notices from Teva amending its ANDAs related to Truvada and Atripla. In the notice related to Truvada, Teva challenged four patents related to
tenofovir and two additional patents related to emtricitabine. In the notice related to Atripla, Teva challenged four patents related to tenofovir, two additional patents
related to emtricitabine and two patents related to efavirenz. We expect to file a lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the four Viread patents and two additional
emtricitabine patents. BMS and Merck have the rights to enforce and defend the patents related to efavirenz. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these
actions, and we may spend significant resources enforcing these patents. If we are unsuccessful in these lawsuits, some or all of our original claims in the patents
may be narrowed or invalidated and the patent protection for Truvada, Atripla and Viread in the United States could be substantially shortened. Further, if all of the
patents covering those products are invalidated, the FDA could approve Teva’s request to manufacture a generic version of such products.
In addition, we, along with certain of our officers and a former officer, were named as defendants in a class action lawsuit alleging violations of federal
securities laws. Further, in August 2009, we received a subpoena from the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
requesting documents regarding the development, marketing and sales of Ranexa. We have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with any related
governmental inquiry.
36Table of Contents
The outcome of the lawsuits above, any other lawsuits that may be brought against us, the investigation or any other such investigations brought against us,
are inherently uncertain, and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant expenses, monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us that
could significantly reduce our earnings and cash flows and harm our business.
Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.
Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax
laws, changes in tax laws and rates, the accounting for stock options and other share-based payments, mergers and acquisitions, future levels of R&D spending,
changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings and
resolution of federal, state and foreign income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be significant and
could have a negative impact on our net income.
Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the
2005, 2006 and 2007 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant
disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions.
Resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.
Changes in accounting rules or policies may affect our financial position and results of operations.
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and related implementation guidelines and interpretations can be highly complex and involve subjective
judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation, the adoption of new guidance or the application of existing guidance to changes in our business could
significantly affect our financial position and results of operations.
If we fail to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop new product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and
commercialize our product candidates.
Our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as
well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, governmental regulation and commercialization. We face competition for personnel from other companies,
universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field
is intense, and there is a limited pool of qualified potential employees to recruit. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms. If we
are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention efforts, our business may be harmed.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
In November 2008, we received notice that Teva Pharmaceuticals (Teva) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a
generic version of Truvada. In the notice, Teva alleges that two of the patents associated with emtricitabine, owned by Emory University and licensed exclusively to
us, are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva’s manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Truvada. In December 2008, we filed a lawsuit in
U.S. District Court in New York against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents. In March 2009, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to
the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Atripla. In the notice, Teva challenged the same two emtricitabine patents. In May
2009, we filed another lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents, and this lawsuit was consolidated with
the lawsuit filed in December 2008. In January 2010, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a
generic version of Viread. In the notice, Teva challenged four of the tenofovir patents protecting Viread. In January 2010, we also received notices from Teva
amending its ANDAs related to Truvada and Atripla. In the notice related to Truvada, Teva challenged four patents related to tenofovir and two additional patents
related to emtricitabine. In the notice related to Atripla, Teva challenged four patents related to tenofovir, two additional patents related to emtricitabine and two
patents related to efavirenz. We expect to file a lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the four Viread patents and two additional emtricitabine patents. BMS and
Merck have the rights to enforce and defend the patents related to efavirenz. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, and we may spend significant
resources enforcing these patents. If we are unsuccessful in these lawsuits, some or all of our original claims in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated and the
patent protection for Truvada, Atripla and Viread in the United States could be substantially shortened. Further, if all of the patents covering those products are
invalidated, the FDA could approve Teva’s request to manufacture a generic version of such products.

As of February 19, 2010, we had 903,378,986 shares of common stock outstanding held by approximately 479 stockholders of record.
We have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our inception. We currently expect to retain earnings primarily for use in the operation and
expansion of our business, and therefore, do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the near future. In an effort to return value to our stockholders and minimize
dilution from stock issuances, our Board of Directors (Board) authorized a program for the repurchase of our common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $3.00
billion through open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated purchases or other means. As of December 31, 2009,
we completed share repurchases under this program. In January 2010, our Board authorized a new program for the repurchase of our common stock in an amount of
up to $1.00 billion through open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans or privately negotiated purchases or other means, including
accelerated stock repurchase transactions or similar arrangements. This repurchase plan expires in January 2011. See Item 8, Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our stock repurchase program.

Performance Graph(1)
The following graph compares our total stockholder returns for the past five years to two indices: the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index, labeled S&P500
Index; and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, labeled NBI Index. The total return for each index assumes the reinvestment of all dividends, if any, paid by companies
included in these indices and are calculated as of December 31 of each year.
We are a composite member of each of the S&P500 Index and the NBI Index, and we intend to use these indices as comparators for our stock performance
for the purposes of the following graph going forward. As a composite member of the S&P500 Index, we are required under applicable regulations to use this index as
a comparator, and we believe the NBI Index is a relevant comparator since it is composed of peer companies in lines-of-business similar to ours.
The stockholder return shown on the graph below is not necessarily indicative of future performance, and we do not make or endorse any predictions as to
future stockholder returns.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand
our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial
Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the
disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles and are presented in U.S. dollars.
Management Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet medical need. Our mission is to
advance the care of patients suffering from life threatening diseases worldwide. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North America,
Europe and Australia. We market products in the HIV/AIDS, liver diseases, respiratory and cardiovascular/metabolic therapeutic areas. Our products comprise
Truvada® (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), Atripla® (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), Viread® (tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate) and Emtriva® (emtricitabine) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; Hepsera® (adefovir dipivoxil) and Viread for the
treatment of chronic hepatitis B; AmBisome® (amphotericin B liposome for injection) for the treatment of severe fungal infections; Letairis® (ambrisentan) for the
treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Ranexa® (ranolazine) for the treatment of chronic angina; Vistide® (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of
cytomegalovirus infection and Cayston® (aztreonam for inhalation solution) as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) markets Tamiflu® (oseltamivir phosphate) for
the treatment and prevention of influenza under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. Eyetech Inc. markets Macugen® (pegaptanib sodium injection) in
the United States and Europe for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us.
GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK) markets Volibris™ (ambrisentan) outside of the United States for the treatment of PAH under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement
with us. Menarini International Operations Luxembourg SA markets Ranexa outside of the United States under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us.
Astellas US LLC markets Lexiscan® (regadenoson) injection in the United States for use as a pharmacologic stress agent in radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging
(MPI) under a royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us.
Business Highlights
During 2009, we grew our business significantly and achieved record total revenues of $7.01 billion while strengthening our product portfolio and pipeline
programs.
Our commercial achievements for 2009 comprised the continued rollout of Atripla in the European Union including the launch of Atripla in France, the growth
of Atripla and Truvada product sales in the United States and Canada, making gains in the PAH market with Letairis, as well as continuing the expansion of our sales
and marketing infrastructure.
We grew our product sales significantly and continued to strengthen our worldwide organization and infrastructure to support our expanded international
footprint and business activities. In addition, we added Ranexa to our product portfolio through the acquisition of CV Therapeutics, Inc. (CV Therapeutics) in April
2009. In February 2010, we received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Cayston as a treatment to improve respiratory
symptoms in CF patients with P. aeruginosa. Cayston was conditionally approved in Europe and Canada in September 2009. Cayston is delivered via a specific
inhalation device developed by PARI Pharma GmbH.
44Table of Contents
We also made significant advances on the compounds and product candidates in our research and development (R&D) pipeline, including:
• In the HIV area, in January 2010, we announced that both of the Phase 2 clinical studies of cobicistat (formerly GS 9350), our pharmacoenhancer that is in
development as a boosting agent for certain HIV medicines, and a complete single-tablet fixed-dose regimen containing elvitegravir, cobicistat and
Truvada in treatment-naïve patients met their primary objectives of non-inferiority. Pending discussion with the FDA, we expect to initiate three Phase 3
studies before the middle of 2010: two studies for the single-tablet fixed-dose regimen mentioned above and one study for cobicistat. In December 2009,
we completed enrollment in the Phase 3 study evaluating elvitegravir in treatment-experienced patients. In addition, in collaboration with Tibotec
Pharmaceuticals (Tibotec), we are developing a new once-daily fixed-dose combination containing our Truvada and Tibotec’s investigational non-
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, TMC278 (25 mg rilpivirine hydrochloride), which is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials. Subject to positive
outcome of this study, we intend to submit marketing applications for the fixed-dose combination of Truvada and TMC278 in the United States and
Europe during the second half of 2010.
• In the liver disease area, we completed the Phase 2a studies of GS 9450, the caspase inhibitor we licensed from LG Life Sciences, Ltd. in 2007, that is in
development for the treatment of hepatitis C and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and expect to present the results in the second quarter of 2010. We are
continuing the Phase 2b study of GS 9450 for the treatment of hepatitis C. We are also continuing our Phase 2 study of GS 9190, a non-nucleoside
polymerase inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of hepatitis C infection, and expect to complete the study in the second half of 2010.
• In the cardiovascular and metabolic areas, we expanded our product candidate portfolio through the acquisition of CV Therapeutics. We anticipate
commencing patient enrollment in a Phase 2 study of ranolazine for the treatment of diastolic heart failure in patients with preserved ejection fraction in
the second quarter of 2010. We are continuing our Phase 3 study of ambrisentan in patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We are also collaborating with GSK to develop a clinical trial to study combination therapy versus monotherapy in a first-line
treatment setting for PAH. The study, AMBITION, will evaluate first-line combination use with ambrisentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA),
and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, in patients with PAH. We are continuing our Phase 2 study of cicletanine hydrochloride, an oral agent in development for
the treatment of PAH. We announced plans to terminate development of darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension after our second Phase 3
study of the compound failed to meet its co-primary efficacy endpoints. In May 2009, we announced that our marketing authorization application for
regadenoson, an investigational pharmacologic stress agent for radionuclide MPI, was validated by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA).
Following validation of the marketing authorization application, the dossier is distributed to members of the Committee for Medicinal Products for
Human Use (CHMP) for formal review to determine whether regadenoson is a safe and efficacious pharmacologic stress agent in humans.
• In the respiratory area, we are continuing the Phase 3 study of ambrisentan for the treatment of IPF and anticipate completing enrollment of patients in
this study by the end of 2010. We are continuing the Phase 2 study of GS 9310/11, an inhaled co-formulation of fosfomycin and tobramycin, for the
treatment of bacterial infections associated with CF, the Phase 2 study of aztreonam for inhalation solution for the treatment of bronchiectasis and the
Phase 1 study of GS 9411, an oral epithelial sodium channel blocker designed to increase airway hydration for the treatment of pulmonary disease.
Acquisition of CV Therapeutics and Restructuring
In April 2009, we completed the acquisition of CV Therapeutics, a publicly-held biopharmaceutical company based in Palo Alto, California, primarily focused on
the discovery, development and commercialization of small molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic and pulmonary diseases. CV Therapeutics
45Table of Contents
had two marketed products as well as several product candidates in clinical development for the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic and pulmonary diseases. We
believe the acquisition will provide us with an opportunity to further expand into the cardiovascular therapeutic area.
We adopted the new business combinations guidance for recognizing and measuring assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in
the acquiree and applied it to the CV Therapeutics acquisition. As a result, we recognized consideration transferred of $1.39 billion and recorded $951.2 million and
$138.9 million in intangible assets relating to marketed products and in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects, respectively, which constituted a
significant portion of the assets acquired from CV Therapeutics. The results of operations of CV Therapeutics beginning on April 15, 2009, the acquisition date, were
included in our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2009.
During the second quarter of 2009, we approved a plan to realize certain synergies between CV Therapeutics and us, re-align our cardiovascular operations and
eliminate certain redundancies. The restructuring plan included consolidation and re-alignment of the cardiovascular R&D organization, our exit from certain facilities
and the termination of certain contractual obligations. As a result of this restructuring plan, we recorded $26.2 million and $25.7 million in selling, general and
administrative (SG&A) expenses and R&D expenses, respectively, in 2009, primarily related to employee severance, relocation and termination benefits, lease
termination costs and other facilities-related expenses. We expect to incur an additional $20.2 million in 2010 bringing the total amount to be incurred in connection
with the significant activities of our restructuring plan to be approximately $38.8 million for employee severance, relocation and termination benefits and $33.3 million
for facilities-related expenses.
Financial Highlights
Our operating results for the year were led by total product sales of $6.47 billion. Antiviral product sales (Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva)
increased 25% to $5.84 billion in 2009 from $4.67 billion in 2008, and were the key drivers for total product sales growth of 27% for 2009 as compared to 2008. With the
continued uptake of Atripla in the United States and Europe, Atripla contributed $2.38 billion, or 41%, to our total 2009 antiviral product sales. The growth of Atripla
product sales and its increased proportion to overall product sales caused total product gross margin to decrease to 75% in 2009 from 78% in 2008, due primarily to
the efavirenz component of Atripla sales at zero gross margin. Truvada product sales for 2009 comprised $2.49 billion, or 43% of our total 2009 antiviral product sales.
Truvada product sales for 2009 increased 18% from 2008 primarily due to continued sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. Foreign currency
fluctuations in 2009 had an unfavorable impact of approximately $98.5 million on total revenues and $33.6 million on pre-tax income when compared to 2008.
Royalty revenues that we recognized from our collaborations with corporate partners were $491.8 million in 2009, an increase of 125% from royalty revenues of
$218.2 million in 2008. The increase in royalty revenues was due primarily to increased Tamiflu sales by Roche related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide.
Operating expenses increased $825.0 million in 2009, or 31%, compared to 2008, reflecting the increased research and clinical study activity in our development
pipeline, our expanded commercial activities worldwide, as well as the higher headcount, infrastructure and technology-related costs required to support the
continued growth of our business.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $665.2 million during the year, driven primarily by our operating cash flows of $3.08 billion
partially offset by cash used to acquire CV Therapeutics of $1.13 billion, net of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities acquired from CV Therapeutics of
$245.4 million, and $998.5 million used to repurchase approximately 21.8 million shares of our common stock through open market purchases under the now completed
$3.00 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors (Board) in October 2007.
46Table of Contents
2010 Outlook
Our operating objectives for 2010 include increasing the market share of our commercial products, continuing to strengthen our pipeline with internally
developed and/or externally in-licensed or purchased opportunities and strengthening our key alliances.
From a commercial standpoint, we have a number of internal and external initiatives intended to promote the continued growth of our franchises. In the HIV
area, we expect a favorable impact from our updated Atripla label that includes data from Study 073 supporting switching patients from other HIV regimens to Atripla,
revised U.S. Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines that recommend earlier treatment for patients with HIV and the extension of the Ryan
White Treatment Act which should provide stable funding for AIDS Drug Assistance Programs in the United States through 2013. In the hepatitis B virus (HBV)
area, we will continue to support educational and promotional activities focused on Asian communities, highlighting the need to screen, diagnose and link patients to
care. As part of those efforts, we will have a larger hepatitis B field team in 2010 in the United States. In the cardiovascular area, we will continue in our efforts to raise
awareness of Gilead in the PAH and cardiology communities and believe this will help grow revenues of Letairis and Ranexa in 2010.
We are mindful that conditions in our current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals. Some of the factors that could affect
our business include: the potential healthcare reform in the United States, continued government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in
foreign currency exchange rates. We will continue to monitor these factors and will adjust our business processes to mitigate these risks to our business.
The successes we experienced in 2009 have helped us maintain and build a financially sound business model that we believe will allow us to continue to
further expand our commercial, collaborative and R&D activities and to maintain quality and compliance. As we continue to grow our business and achieve greater
operational leverage, we remain focused on profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable solid execution of our operating
objectives for 2010.
Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those
related to revenue recognition, intangible assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, prepaid royalties, clinical trial accruals, our tax provision and stock-based
compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.
We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Revenue Recognition
Product Sales
We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is
fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements,
customer
47Table of Contents
incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products. These estimates are deducted from gross product
sales at the time such revenues are recognized. Of these reductions from gross product sales, government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales
and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management.
Government Rebates
We estimate reductions to our revenues for government-managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign
government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs. These reductions are settled
either by the company being invoiced directly or through charge-backs from our wholesalers. Government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in
other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual
government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price, which we record as
allowances against accounts receivable. Although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the United States, to date, payments made to foreign governments
have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates. For government programs in the United States, we estimate these sales allowances based
on contractual terms, historical utilization rates, new information regarding changes in these programs’ regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of
the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in
accordance with our inventory management agreements. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, U.S government rebates of $885.5 million, $625.0 million and $423.3 million,
respectively, representing 12%, 10% and 10% of total gross product sales, respectively, were deducted from gross product sales. We believe that the methodology
that we use to estimate our sales allowances for government price reductions is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However,
actual results may differ. Based on the current information available to us, actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than 3% from our
estimates recorded in those periods. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had accrued U.S. government rebates of $242.9 million and $173.4 million, respectively, in
other accrued liabilities and an allowance of $41.8 million and $32.8 million, respectively, recorded against accounts receivable.
The following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our U.S. government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts:

Total $ 139,370 $ 624,970 $ 558,067 $ 206,273
Intangible Assets
In conjunction with business combinations that we have completed, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to marketed products, IPR&D
projects and goodwill as part of our recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Identifiable intangible assets,
such as those
48Table of Contents
related to marketed products or IPR&D projects, are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. We believe the fair values assigned to our
acquired intangible assets are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates. Discounted
cash flow models are used in valuing these intangible assets, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:
• estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates;
• the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;
• the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;
• the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product
candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and
• risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination. Goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are required to be tested for impairment at least annually.
We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events
occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair values of the assets below their carrying amounts. As of December 31, 2009, we had
$601.5 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets consisting of $462.6 million of goodwill resulting from various business combinations and $138.9 million of
intangible assets related to the IPR&D projects that we acquired from CV Therapeutics.
Of the $138.9 million of IPR&D intangible assets that we acquired from CV Therapeutics, $93.4 million related to GS 9667 (formerly CVT-3619), a product
candidate in Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. The remaining balance of the intangible assets related to the IPR&D projects
represented various other in-process projects with no single project comprising a significant portion of the total value. The estimated fair value of the IPR&D
intangible assets acquired from CV Therapeutics was determined using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. We
estimated the fair value of these intangible assets using a present value discount rate of 9%, which is based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for
companies with profiles substantially similar to that of CV Therapeutics. This is comparable to the estimated internal rate of return for CV Therapeutics’ operations
and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets. We compensated for the differing phases of development of each project by
probability-adjusting our estimation of the expected future cash flows associated with each project. We then determined the present value of the expected future cash
flows using the discount rate of 9%. The projected cash flows from the IPR&D projects were based on various estimates and assumptions including those noted
above.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest
that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to the Ranexa product, which we acquired from CV
Therapeutics, over its estimated useful life using an amortization rate derived from our forecasted future product sales for Ranexa. Our product sales forecasts are
prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake
of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and
significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, we will prospectively update the rate used to amortize our intangible asset related to Ranexa which may increase
future cost of goods sold, as that is where we record the amortization expense. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to the Lexiscan product, which we also
acquired from CV Therapeutics, over its estimated useful life to cost of goods sold on a
49Table of Contents
straight-line basis. Given that current Lexiscan revenues consist of royalties received from a collaboration partner and we will have limited ongoing access and
visibility into that partner’s future sales forecasts, we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amortization rate utilizing a forecasted product sales approach. As of
December 31, 2009, we had $923.3 million of net unamortized finite-lived intangible assets consisting primarily of intangible assets related to the marketed products
that we acquired from CV Therapeutics.
Our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on our historical and projected future operating results, our extent or manner of use of
the acquired assets, legal and regulatory factors and events, our overall business strategy and market and economic trends. If events occur in the future that cause
us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangible assets are impaired, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely
impacted.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This
allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and
individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its
potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate
were to deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of
total accounts receivable did not materially change from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to
cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors, especially with respect to the government funding
and reimbursement practices in the European market could materially change these expectations and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts.
Prepaid Royalties
We capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost, specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory University (Emory) for the HIV
indication, based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to Emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product
sales incorporating emtricitabine. The present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted-average cost of capital. We review periodically
the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write-down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the
estimated life of the prepaid royalty. Some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor, significant deviations in
recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls.
We amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted future HIV product sales incorporating emtricitabine. Our
product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected
future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a
previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors in
the same HIV market as emtricitabine, we will prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future cost of goods
sold, as that is where we record the amortization expense. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we
paid to Emory of $245.0 million and $275.0 million, respectively. Amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was $29.9 million, $31.8 million and $14.3
million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
50Table of Contents
Clinical Trial Accruals
We record accruals for estimated clinical study costs. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations (CROs). These
costs are a significant component of R&D expenses. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we incurred CRO costs of $109.9 million, $111.8 million and $65.6 million,
respectively. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based
upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs. We validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed
reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and
make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs.
Generally, a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs is associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. We extensively outsource
our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up
activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training and program management. Start-up
costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature.
The remaining clinical activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual
contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed per unit prices and can vary in length between three months for a single dose Phase 1 clinical study and up
to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 clinical study. The average length of contracts in 2009, 2008 and 2007 has been at the upper end of this range in order
to provide long-term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Truvada, Atripla, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva, Letairis and Ranexa. All of our
material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO and certain non-cancelable
expenses incurred at any point of termination. Amounts paid in advance relating to uncompleted services will be refunded to us if a contract is terminated. Some
contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract. Such additional termination payments are only
recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated. Through December 31, 2009, differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any
particular study have not been material. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or underestimates activity
levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we may have to record additional and potentially significant R&D expenses in future periods.
Tax Provision
We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of
all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely
than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a
valuation allowance.
If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in
which such determination is first made. Such an adjustment was made in 2009 and 2008 when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our
deferred tax assets would be realized, and therefore, we released the related valuation allowance. This resulted in a credit to goodwill of approximately $8.0 million for
2008 and an income tax benefit of approximately $14.0 million and $15.5 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or
regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation, changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of income before tax.
51Table of Contents
At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $93.3 million and $119.3 million, respectively, including
interest of $5.4 million and $10.1 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $74.7 million and $111.1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition.
In 2009, we reached agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on several issues related to the examinations of our federal income tax returns for 2003
through 2007. We also amended our California income tax returns for 2003 through 2007 based on the resolution of certain tax positions with the IRS. As a result, we
reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by $76.2 million in 2009.
As of December 31, 2009, we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $5.0 million in the next 12
months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are
currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities.
We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of
limitations is open for 2003 and onward. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net
operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations remains open for all years.
Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax
years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with
these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our
exposures associated with our tax filing positions.
We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized
in an enterprise’s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material
adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a
material impact on the results of operations for that period.
Stock-based Compensation
We measure all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, based on their relative fair values. Fair values of awards
granted under our stock option plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan were estimated at grant or purchase dates using a Black-Scholes option valuation model.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and expected award life.
Stock-based compensation is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income using a graded vesting
expense attribution approach for non-vested stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, and using the straight-line expense attribution approach for stock
options granted after our adoption of new guidance for share-based payments to employees and directors on January 1, 2006. As stock-based compensation
expenses related to stock options recognized on adoption of the new guidance is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, gross expense has been reduced for
estimated forfeitures. The guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
52Table of Contents
forfeitures differ from those estimates. We estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience. Prior to the adoption of this guidance, pro forma information that
was required to be disclosed included forfeitures as they occurred. As a result of the guidance adopted on January 1, 2006, we only recognize a tax benefit from
stock-based compensation in additional paid-in capital (APIC) if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been
utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income
deduction through our Consolidated Statements of Income rather than through APIC.
During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized stock-based compensation expenses of $185.8 million, $153.4 million and $184.6
million, respectively, in operating expenses, and we capitalized $11.4 million, $9.9 million and $9.8 million, respectively, to inventory. As of December 31, 2009, we had
unrecognized stock-based compensation expenses of $347.4 million related to non-vested stock options, which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted-
average period of 2.7 years.
Our management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board, and the
Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to these critical accounting policies.
Results of Operations
Total Revenues
We had total revenues of $7.01 billion in 2009, $5.34 billion in 2008 and $4.23 billion in 2007. Included in total revenues were product sales, royalty revenues
and contract and other revenues.

Total product sales $ 6,469,311 27% $ 5,084,796 36% $ 3,733,109
Total product sales increased by 27% in 2009 compared to 2008 and by 36% in 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to an overall increase in our antiviral
product sales including the strong growth of Atripla sales as well as the continued growth of Truvada sales. Foreign currency denominated product sales
experienced a net loss from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar of approximately $98.5 million for 2009 compared to 2008, and a net benefit from the depreciation of the
U.S. dollar of approximately $148.2 million for 2008 compared to 2007. A significant percentage of our product sales continued to be denominated in foreign
currencies. We used foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those
denominated in Euro. This reduced, but did not eliminate, fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Antiviral Products
Antiviral product sales increased 25% in 2009 compared to 2008 and by 36% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by sales volume growth of Atripla and
Truvada. The increase in 2008 compared to 2007 was also due to a favorable foreign currency exchange impact.

Truvada sales increased by 18% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe, partially offset by
an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact. Truvada sales increased by 33% in 2008 compared to 2007 driven primarily by sales volume growth in
the United States and Europe and a favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Truvada sales accounted for 43%, 45% and 46% of our total antiviral
product sales for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
• Atripla
Atripla sales increased by 51% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. The European
growth benefited from the launch of Atripla in France in the second quarter of 2009. Atripla sales increased by 74% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven
primarily by the continued uptake of Atripla in the United States, as well as launches of the product in most European countries. Atripla sales include
the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin. The efavirenz portion of our Atripla sales was approximately $880.7 million, $576.0 million and $334.3
million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Atripla sales accounted for 41%, 34% and 26% of our total antiviral product sales for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.
• Other Antiviral Products
Other antiviral product sales, which include product sales of Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva decreased by 3% for 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily
by sales volume decreases in Hepsera, partially offset by sales volume increases in Viread for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B. Other
antiviral product sales increased by 5% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by a 13% increase in Hepsera sales which benefited from a favorable
foreign currency exchange impact as well as sales volume growth in certain European countries.
AmBisome
Sales of AmBisome increased 3% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in certain European markets, partially offset by an
unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact. Sales of AmBisome increased 10% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by a favorable foreign currency
exchange impact and sales volume growth in certain European markets. AmBisome product sales in the United States and Canada relate solely to our sales of
AmBisome to Astellas Pharma US, Inc. which are recorded at our manufacturing cost.
Letairis
Sales of Letairis for the treatment of PAH increased by 63% for 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. Sales of
Letairis increased 437% in 2008 compared to 2007, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States as Letairis was launched in June of 2007.
Ranexa
Sales of Ranexa were $131.1 million for the period from April 15, 2009 (the date of our acquisition of CV Therapeutics) to December 31, 2009.
We expect total product sales to continue to grow in 2010 as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts.

Royalty Revenues
The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues (in thousands):
2009 Change 2008 Change 2007
Royalty revenues $491,818 125% $218,180 (53)% $468,155
Our most significant source of royalty revenues for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was from sales of Tamiflu by Roche.
Royalty revenues for 2009 were $491.8 million, an increase of 125% compared to 2008, driven primarily by the recognition of Tamiflu royalties from Roche of
$392.7 million in 2009 compared to Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $155.5 million in 2008. The higher Tamiflu royalties for 2009 were due to increased Tamiflu sales by
Roche related primarily to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Royalty revenues for 2008 were $218.2 million, a decrease of 53% compared to 2007, driven
primarily by the recognition of Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $155.5 million in 2008 compared to Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $414.5 million in 2007. The lower
Tamiflu royalties for 2008 was due primarily to decreased Roche sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by
Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which Tamiflu is sold.
Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin
The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands), cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross
margin:
2009 Change 2008 Change 2007
Total product sales $ 6,469,311 27% $ 5,084,796 36% $ 3,733,109
Cost of goods sold $ 1,595,558 42% $ 1,127,246 47% $ 768,771
Product gross margin 75% 78% 79%
Our product gross margin for 2009 was 75%, compared to 78% for 2008. The lower product gross margin in 2009 was due primarily to the higher proportion of
Atripla sales, which include the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin, as well as the amortization associated with the intangible assets acquired in our
acquisition of CV Therapeutics. Our product gross margin for 2008 was 78% compared to 79% for 2007. The decrease in product gross margin was due primarily to the
higher proportion of Atripla sales, which include the efavirenz portion at zero product gross margin, and the impact of changes in the product and geographic mix of
our product sales. A higher mix of Atripla product sales decreases our overall product gross margin. Although we record 100% of Atripla product sales, we only
benefit from the product gross margin on the Truvada portion of Atripla sales. The efavirenz portion of Atripla sales carries a zero product gross profit and gross
margin since we purchase efavirenz from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) at BMS’s net selling price of efavirenz.
We expect our product gross margin in 2010 to be lower compared to 2009, due primarily to a higher proportion of expected Atripla sales.

Research and Development Expenses
The following table summarizes the period over period changes in the major components of our R&D expenses (in thousands):
2009 Change 2008 Change 2007
Research $185,019 16% $159,148 21% $131,019
Clinical development 615,041 37% 449,598 25% 361,091
Pharmaceutical development 139,858 24% 113,022 14% 98,916
Total research and development $ 939,918 30% $ 721,768 22% $ 591,026
R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by CROs, materials
and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities-related costs. Our R&D activities are separated into three main
categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development. Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs. Clinical development
costs include costs for clinical trials. Pharmaceutical development expenses consist of costs for product formulation and chemical analysis.
R&D expenses in 2009 increased by $218.2 million or 30%, compared to 2008, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $88.8 million
driven by higher headcount related to the growth of our business, the R&D expense reimbursement related to our Tibotec TMC278 collaboration of $52.4 million and
increased clinical study expenses of $23.9 million. The increase in compensation and benefits expenses was also driven by severance and termination benefits
associated with our restructuring activities related to our acquisition of CV Therapeutics.
R&D expenses in 2008 increased by $130.7 million or 22%, compared to 2007, due primarily to increased clinical study expenses of $75.2 million primarily in the
antiviral and cardiovascular areas, as well as increased compensation and benefits expenses of $50.7 million due primarily to higher headcount.
In general, significant collaboration payments, like those made to Tibotec, will cause our R&D expenses to fluctuate period over period. In 2010, we expect
R&D expenses to increase over 2009 levels due to increased spending on our internal and collaborative R&D efforts as we anticipate that some of our product
candidates will progress into more advanced clinical studies as well as adding more clinical development programs to our pipeline.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our SG&A expenses over the last three years (in thousands):
2009 Change 2008 Change 2007
Selling, general and administrative $946,686 19% $797,344 13% $705,741
SG&A expenses in 2009 increased by $149.3 million or 19%, compared to 2008, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $75.4 million
driven by higher headcount related to the growth of our business, increased contract and professional services expenses of $46.6 million driven primarily by our
expanding sales and marketing activities and $5.8 million related to certain contract termination costs. The increase in compensation and benefits expenses was also
driven by severance and termination benefits associated with our restructuring activities related to our acquisition of CV Therapeutics.
SG&A expenses for 2008 increased by $91.6 million or 13%, compared to 2007, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $41.6 million
due largely to higher headcount, increased marketing and
56Table of Contents
promotional expenses of $19.9 million to support our expanded commercial operations, increased consulting and support services expenses of $13.0 million related to
the growth in our business, and costs of $12.4 million associated with certain employee termination-related disputes in our international operations.
In 2010, we expect SG&A expenses to increase over 2009 levels due to increased investment to support the growth in our HIV franchise, the full year impact of
sales and marketing activities for Ranexa and the commercialization of Cayston. We believe we have the appropriate infrastructure to support the growth of our
business in 2010.
Purchased In-process Research and Development Expenses
In connection with our acquisition of the cicletanine assets from Navitas Assets, LLC in 2008, we recorded IPR&D expense of $10.9 million during the year
ended December 31, 2008. As we do not consider the acquisition to be a material purchase, we have not made further disclosures regarding the related purchased
IPR&D.
In connection with our acquisition of Myogen in 2006, we recorded purchased IPR&D expenses of $2.06 billion during the year ended December 31, 2006
related to the ambrisentan and darusentan IPR&D projects that we acquired. The purchased IPR&D expense represented the estimated fair value of Myogen’s
incomplete R&D projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of the acquisition date and, therefore, was expensed
upon acquisition. With respect to ambrisentan, in June 2007, the FDA approved Letairis for the treatment of PAH in the United States. Additionally, in April 2008, the
European Commission granted our collaboration partner, GSK, marketing authorization for ambrisentan for the treatment of PAH, which is marketed under the name
Volibris by GSK. With respect to darusentan, in December 2009, we announced plans to terminate the development of darusentan for the treatment of resistant
hypertension after our second Phase 3 study of the compound failed to meet its co-primary efficacy endpoints.
In connection with our acquisition of Corus Pharma, Inc. (Corus) in 2006, we recorded purchased IPR&D expenses of $335.6 million during the year ended
December 31, 2006 related to the aztreonam for inhalation solution for CF IPR&D project that we acquired. The purchased IPR&D expense represented the estimated
fair value of Corus’s incomplete R&D project that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date and,
therefore, was expensed upon acquisition. In February 2010, we received marketing approval from the FDA for Cayston as a treatment to improve respiratory
symptoms in CF patients with P. aeruginosa. Cayston was conditionally approved in Europe and Canada in September 2009.
Interest and Other Income, Net
We recorded interest and other income, net, of $42.4 million, $59.4 million and $109.8 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in 2009
compared to 2008 was due primarily to decreased interest income of $40.6 million driven by a reduction in the average yield of our investment portfolio as a result of
lower interest rates, partially offset by an increase in net foreign currency exchange gains of $15.7 million. The decrease in 2008 compared to 2007 was due primarily to
increased costs related to our hedging activities of $32.3 million, net foreign currency exchange losses of $15.7 million and decreased interest income of $7.5 million
due primarily to lower interest rates, partially offset by the write-downs of certain securities recorded in 2007.
Interest Expense
On January 1, 2009, we adopted guidance for our convertible senior notes due in 2011 (2011 Notes) and convertible senior notes due in 2013 (2013 Notes)
(collectively, the Notes) on a retrospective basis. The guidance requires us to bifurcate the conversion option from the debt instrument by classifying the conversion
option in equity and then accreting the resulting discount on the debt as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt. As a result of the retrospective
adoption of this guidance, we reflected additional interest expense of
57Table of Contents
$53.1 million and $50.1 million, respectively, and a related benefit from income taxes of $20.9 million and $19.7 million, respectively, in 2008 and 2007. We recorded
additional interest expense of $56.2 million and a related benefit from income taxes of $21.9 million in 2009.
Our interest expense was $69.7 million, $65.2 million and $63.2 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increases in 2009 compared to 2008 and in 2008
compared to 2007 were due primarily to the effect of accreting the debt discount on the Notes as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt as
discussed above.
Provision for Income Taxes
Our provision for income taxes was $876.4 million, $702.4 million and $635.4 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2009 effective tax rate of 25.0%
differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits, the resolution of certain tax positions with tax authorities and certain operating
earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes and the revaluation of certain
state tax assets related to the integration of CV Therapeutics. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are
intended to be permanently reinvested.
The 2008 effective tax rate of 26.3% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits, the resolution of certain tax positions with tax
authorities and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state
taxes.
The 2007 effective tax rate of 28.7% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S.
subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes.
As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $93.3 million and $119.3 million, respectively, including
interest of $5.4 million and $10.1 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $74.7 million and $111.1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. We have continued to classify interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
In 2009, we reached agreement with the IRS on several issues related to the examinations of our federal income tax returns for 2003 through 2007. We also
amended our California income tax returns for 2003 through 2007 based on the resolution of certain tax positions with the IRS. As a result, we reduced our
unrecognized tax benefits by $76.2 million in 2009.
As of December 31, 2009, we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $5.0 million in the next 12
months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining
unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities.

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 3,904,846 $ 3,239,639 $ 2,722,422
Working capital $ 2,940,927 $ 3,057,416 $ 2,271,344
Year Ended December 31:

Operating activities $ 3,080,054 $ 2,143,384 $ 1,669,082
Investing activities $ (2,215,900) $ (178,819) $ (1,302,467)
Financing activities $ (1,051,438) $ (1,474,569) $ (170,983)
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.90 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase of $665.2 million or 21% from December 31, 2008. This
increase was primarily attributable to net cash provided by operations of $3.08 billion and proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans
of $222.7 million, partially offset by the following:
• cash used to acquire CV Therapeutics of $1.13 billion, net of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities acquired from CV Therapeutics of $245.4
million;
• $998.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program; and
• $305.5 million used to extinguish the convertible senior notes we assumed in our acquisition of CV Therapeutics.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.24 billion at December 31, 2008, an increase of $517.2 million or 19% from December 31, 2007. This
increase was primarily attributable to:
• net cash provided by operations of $2.14 billion in 2008; and
• proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans of $246.1 million in 2008.
This increase from 2007 to 2008 was partially offset by our repurchases of $1.97 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program during 2008.
Working Capital
Working capital was $2.94 billion at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $116.5 million or 4% from working capital as of December 31, 2008. This decrease was
primarily attributable to:
• an increase of $209.3 million in accounts payable due primarily to the purchases of efavirenz at its estimated market value from BMS; and
• a decrease of $133.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities since we held a higher proportion of long-term marketable
securities as of December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008.
This decrease from 2008 to 2009 was partially offset by an increase of $366.1 million in our accounts receivable, net, driven primarily by increased product sales.
59Table of Contents
Working capital at December 31, 2008 was $3.06 billion, an increase of $786.1 million from December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to:
• an increase of $327.9 million in inventories due primarily to the purchases of efavirenz at its estimated market value from BMS;
• an increase of $228.3 million in accounts receivable, net, driven primarily by increased product sales; and
• an increase of $618.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities.
This increase from 2007 to 2008 was partially offset by a $310.9 million increase in accounts payable due primarily to the purchases of efavirenz at its estimated
market value from BMS.
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities of $3.08 billion in 2009 primarily related to net income of $2.63 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $180.7 million
of stock-based compensation expenses and $148.4 million of amortization expenses. As a result of our adoption of the guidance for our joint ventures with BMS on
January 1, 2009, we reclassified the change in noncontrolling interest from cash provided by operating activities to cash used in financing activities.
Cash provided by operating activities of $2.14 billion in 2008 primarily related to net income of $1.97 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $209.5 million
of tax benefits from employee stock plans and $153.4 million of stock-based compensation expenses. This was partially offset by $191.9 million of excess tax benefits
from stock option exercises which we reclassified to cash used in financing activities.
Cash provided by operating activities of $1.67 billion in 2007 primarily related to net income of $1.58 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $184.6 million
of stock-based compensation expenses, $113.4 million of deferred income taxes and $110.7 million of tax benefits related to employee stock plans. This was partially
offset by a $332.4 million net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities in 2009 was $2.22 billion, driven by cash used for our acquisition of CV Therapeutics of $1.25 billion (net of cash acquired), a
net use of $738.0 million in purchases of marketable securities and $230.1 million of capital expenditures for the year. Capital expenditures made in 2009, 2008 and 2007
related primarily to the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities, upgrades to our facilities and spending on computer and laboratory equipment, as well as
enterprise software, to accommodate our continued business growth. Capital expenditures in 2009 also included the purchase of an office building and approximately
30 acres of land located in Foster City, California.
Cash used in investing activities in 2008 was $178.8 million, driven primarily by a net use of $53.0 million in purchases of marketable securities and $115.0
million of capital expenditures for the year.
Cash used in investing activities in 2007 was $1.30 billion, driven primarily by a net use of $1.17 billion in purchases of marketable securities, cash used in our
acquisition of Nycomed Limited of $46.4 million (net of cash acquired) and $78.6 million of capital expenditures for the year. Capital expenditures in 2007 included the
construction of a new building at our Foster City, California headquarters.
As of December 31, 2009, we had capital expenditure commitments of $24.8 million, which consisted primarily of enterprise software purchase commitments. We
expect to fulfill such commitments from funds generated from our operating cash flows.
60Table of Contents
Cash Used in Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities in 2009 was $1.05 billion, driven primarily by the $998.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock
repurchase program and the $305.5 million used to extinguish the convertible senior notes assumed from the acquisition of CV Therapeutics. The cash outflows were
partially offset by proceeds of $222.7 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans.
As a result of our adoption of the guidance for our joint ventures with BMS on January 1, 2009, we reclassified the change in noncontrolling interest from cash
provided by operating activities to cash used in financing activities, as discussed above.
Under our amended and restated credit agreement, we, along with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gilead Biopharmaceutics Ireland Corporation, may borrow up
to an aggregate of $1.25 billion in revolving credit loans. The credit agreement also includes a sub-facility for swing-line loans and letters of credit. Loans under the
credit agreement bear interest at an interest rate of either LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 0.20 percent to 0.32 percent or the base rate, as described in the credit
agreement. In April 2009, in connection with the acquisition of CV Therapeutics, we borrowed $400.0 million under the credit agreement to partially fund the
acquisition and had fully repaid the amount as of December 31, 2009. The credit agreement will terminate in December 2012 and all unpaid borrowings thereunder shall
be due and payable at that time. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay loans under the credit agreement in whole or in part without penalty, subject to
certain conditions. As of December 31, 2009, approximately $1.25 billion was available to be drawn down under this credit agreement.
Cash used in financing activities in 2008 was $1.47 billion, driven primarily by the $1.97 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock
repurchase program. The cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $246.1 million that we received from issuances of common stock under our employee
stock plans as well as $191.9 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises. In October 2007, our Board authorized a program for the repurchase of our
common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $3.00 billion through open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated
purchases or other means. In 2008, under this stock repurchase program, we repurchased shares in the open market and also entered into two structured accelerated
share repurchase transactions with third parties which are described below.
In February and October 2008, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements with a financial institution to repurchase our common stock on an
accelerated basis. For the February 2008 transaction, we paid $500.0 million to settle the initial purchase and received 9,373,548 shares of our common stock at a price
of $53.34 per share. In June 2008, upon termination of the agreement we received an additional 239,612 shares of our common stock based on the average of the daily
volume weighted-average prices of our common stock during a specified period less a predetermined discount per share. As a result, the total number of shares
repurchased and retired under this accelerated share repurchase agreement was 9,613,160 shares at an average purchase price of $52.01 per share. For the October
2008 transaction, we paid $750.0 million to settle the initial purchase and received 14,874,519 shares of our common stock at a price of $50.42 per share. In March 2009,
upon termination of the agreement we received an additional 1,356,337 shares of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume weighted-average prices
of our common stock during a specified period less a predetermined discount per share. As a result, the total number of shares repurchased and retired under this
accelerated share repurchase agreement was 16,230,856 shares at an average purchase price of $46.21 per share.
As of December 31, 2009, we completed share repurchases under our $3.00 billion stock repurchase program. In January 2010, our Board authorized a new
program for the repurchase of our common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $1.00 billion through open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule
10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated purchases or other means. This stock repurchase plan will expire in January 2011.
Cash used in financing activities in 2007 was $171.0 million, driven primarily by the $487.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock
repurchase program and $99.0 million used to pay off all
61Table of Contents
remaining amounts due on our term loan, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans of $243.4 million, distributions
from noncontrolling interest of $96.3 million as well as $76.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises.
We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the
foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:
• the commercial performance of our current and future products;
• the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials;
• the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews;
• the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities;
• administrative expenses;
• the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities;
• the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products;
• the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and
• costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations.
We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot
assure that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.
Contractual Obligations
Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and
inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments
and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2009

(1) At December 31, 2009, we had outstanding principal of $1.16 billion under the Notes that we issued in April 2006.
(2) At December 31, 2009, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $24.8 million primarily relating to enterprise software purchase commitments.
62Table of Contents
(3) At December 31, 2009, we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts
represent minimum purchase requirements and actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts.
(4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development
arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or
commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above.
(5) At December 31, 2009, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although all of
our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not cancelled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing
contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts.
We had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $116.0 million as of December 31, 2009. We believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized
tax benefits will decrease by approximately $5.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the tax authorities around certain of our uncertain
tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if
any, with the respective tax authorities. Such amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable and non current deferred tax assets on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet and have not been included in the table above.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended standards for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity
under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) section 810-10-25. These amended standards eliminate a mandatory quantitative approach to determine whether a
variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity in favor of a qualitatively focused analysis, and require an ongoing
reassessment of whether the entity is a primarily beneficiary. The amended standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2010. We have been
consolidating our joint ventures with BMS because we are the primary beneficiary. We are still evaluating whether the revised standard will have any impact on our
Consolidated Financial Statements.
In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards for revenue recognition for agreements with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the
determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new
standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual
method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2011, however early adoption is
permitted. We have not yet evaluated whether these new standards will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States, Canada and Ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the United
States, including Europe and Australia. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates
or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies,
63Table of Contents
the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign
currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of
foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we
transact significant amounts of business.
A significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to
partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales. We also hedge certain monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is
recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions
being hedged.
The following table summarizes the notional amounts, weighted-average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign currency exchange
forward contracts at December 31, 2009. We had no foreign currency exchange option contracts outstanding at December 31, 2009. All contracts have maturities of 18
months or less. Weighted-average rates are stated in terms of the amount of U.S. dollars per foreign currency. Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at
December 31, 2009 (notional amounts and fair values in U.S. dollars and in thousands):
Foreign Currency Exchange Forward Contracts

Average
Notional Settlement
Currency Amount Price Fair Value
Euro $2,728,279 1.43 $ (4,430)
British Pound 311,293 1.60 2,305
Canadian Dollar 153,218 1.12 (11,216)
Australian Dollar 81,632 0.84 (5,228)
Swiss Franc 67,976 1.06 (898)
Danish Krone 35,130 5.22 (318)
Swedish Krone 27,097 7.38 (581)
Norwegian Krone 18,163 6.05 (750)
New Zealand Dollar 16,683 0.81 (366)
Turkish Lira 6,134 1.52 (7)
Total $ 3,445,605 $ (21,489 )
The total notional amount of $3.45 billion and total fair value relating to our net liability of $21.5 million on our open foreign currency exchange forward
contracts at December 31, 2009 compares with the total notional amount of $2.39 billion and total fair value relating to our net asset of $90.7 million on our open
foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts at December 31, 2008.
Interest Rate Risk
Our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our
investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and
investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows:
• safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk;
• liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and
• competitive after-tax rate of return.

(1) In April 2006, we issued the Notes in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Notes were issued at par and
bear interest rates of 0.50% and 0.625% for the 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes, respectively, and may be converted into shares of our common stock subject to
certain circumstances.
Credit Risk
A portion of our marketable securities consist of auction rate securities. In 2008, we began observing the failed auctions for auction rate securities whose
underlying assets are comprised of student loans. As of December 31, 2009, we held approximately $104.8 million of auction rate securities within our available-for-
sale long-term marketable securities whose underlying assets were comprised of student loans. Our auction rate securities comprised approximately 3% of our total
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2009. All of our auction rate securities, including those subject to the failed auctions, are
currently rated AAA, consistent with the high quality rating required by our investment policy, are supported by the federal government as part of the Federal Family
Education Loan Program, and are over-collateralized. Our auction rate securities reset every seven to 35 days with maturity dates ranging from 2023 through 2041 and
have annual interest rates ranging from 0.4% to 1.2%. As of December 31, 2009, our auction rate securities continued to earn interest.
If auctions continue to fail for securities in which we have invested, we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities at par, should we
need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities. However, based on our total cash and marketable securities position, our expected operating cash
flows as well as access to funds through our credit facility, we believe that we will be able to hold these securities until there is a recovery in the auction market and
the related securities, which may be at final maturity. As a result, we do not anticipate that the current illiquidity of these auction rate securities will have a material
effect on our cash requirements or working capital.
In light of the volatility and developments that we have seen in the financial markets, we continue to review our cash equivalents and marketable securities
carefully and strive to invest prudently. We believe that maintaining the primary goals of our investment policy, safety and preservation of principal and
diversification of risk, as well as liquidity, has protected us from many of the risks in the credit markets while allowing us to continue to meet our operating cash flow
requirements as well as execute on other strategic opportunities such as the acquisition of CV Therapeutics in 2009.
Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2009 was $1.39 billion, compared to $1.02 billion at December 31, 2008. The growth in our accounts receivable
balance was due primarily to higher product sales of our antiviral products in the United States and Europe. Our European product sales to government-owned or
supported customers in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices. This has
resulted and may continue to result in an increase in days sales outstanding due to the average length of time that we have accounts receivable outstanding. This, in
turn, may increase the credit risk related to certain of our customers. Sales to customers in these countries in Europe that tend to pay relatively slowly have increased,
and may continue to further increase. At December 31,
65Table of Contents
2009, our accounts receivable for Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain totaled $753.6 million, of which $289.4 million was more than 120 days past due based on
contractual payment terms. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and believe that our
accounts receivable, net of allowances, as reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are collectible.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
An evaluation as of December 31, 2009 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that the information required to be
disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at December 31, 2009.
(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations
and can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation, we concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K and have issued a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. Their report on the audit of internal
control over financial reporting appears below.
(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated any changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2009, and has concluded that there was no change during such quarter that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Gilead Sciences, Inc.
We have audited Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Gilead Sciences, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the
COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2009 consolidated financial
statements of Gilead Sciences, Inc. and our report dated March 1, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Gilead Sciences, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Gilead Sciences, Inc. as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Gilead Sciences, Inc. at
December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for its convertible senior notes that
may be settled in cash upon conversion, its method of accounting for and presentation of noncontrolling interest, and its method of accounting for business
combinations effective January 1, 2009.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis of Presentation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Gilead, our wholly-owned subsidiaries and our joint ventures with Bristol-
Myers Squibb Company (BMS), for which we are the primary beneficiary. We record a noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect
BMS’s interest in the joint ventures. Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of
companies acquired by us from the date of each acquisition for the applicable reporting periods.
FASB Accounting Standards Codification
On July 1, 2009, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). The FASB ASC became the source
of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities, and was effective for
interim periods and fiscal years ending after September 15, 2009. As a result, the majority of historically issued accounting pronouncements are now superseded by
the FASB ASC.
Convertible Senior Notes
On January 1, 2009, we adopted guidance for our convertible senior notes due in 2011 (2011 Notes) and convertible senior notes due in 2013 (2013 Notes)
(collectively, the Notes) on a retrospective basis. The guidance requires us to bifurcate the conversion option from the debt instrument by classifying the conversion
option in
82Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
equity and then accreting the resulting discount on the debt as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt. As a result of the retrospective adoption
of this guidance, we reflected additional interest expense of $53.1 million and $50.1 million, respectively, a related benefit from income taxes of $20.9 million and $19.7
million, respectively, and a decrease in net income per share attributable to Gilead common stockholders on a diluted basis of $0.04 and $0.04, respectively, for the
years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. We recorded additional interest expense of $56.2 million, a related benefit from income taxes of $21.9 million and a decrease
in net income per share attributable to Gilead common stockholders on a diluted basis of approximately $0.04 for the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition, the
retrospective adoption of this guidance decreased deferred tax assets and debt issuance costs included in other assets by an aggregate of $81.7 million, decreased
convertible senior notes, net included in long-term liabilities by $201.8 million and increased total stockholders’ equity by $120.1 million after a charge of $82.6 million
to retained earnings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2008. See Note 10 for additional information.
Noncontrolling Interest
On January 1, 2009, we adopted guidance for our joint ventures with BMS on a retrospective basis. This guidance establishes accounting and reporting
standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to the parent and to
the noncontrolling interests, changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is
deconsolidated. This guidance also establishes additional reporting requirements that identify and distinguish between the ownership interest of the parent and the
interest of the noncontrolling owners. This guidance is effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and requires retrospective
application to all periods presented. As a result of retrospective adoption of this guidance, we reclassified the noncontrolling interest (formerly minority interest) from
liabilities to stockholders’ equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our adoption of this guidance also resulted in the reclassification of the change in
noncontrolling interest from net cash provided by operating activities to net cash used in financing activities on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We
also presented the noncontrolling interest on our Consolidated Statements of Income as net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, a component of consolidated
net income, on a retrospective basis.
Significant Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments
The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including critical
accounting policies or estimates related to revenue recognition, intangible assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, prepaid royalties, clinical trial accruals, our tax
provision and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that
we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Product Sales
We recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is
fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Upon recognition of revenue from product sales, provisions are made for government rebates such as
Medicaid
83Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
reimbursements, customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products, as appropriate.
Items Deducted from Gross Product Sales
Government Rebates
We estimate reductions to our revenues for government-managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign
government programs based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates, new information regarding changes in these programs’ regulations and guidelines that
would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and, for our U.S. product sales, channel
inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. Government rebates that are invoiced directly to
us are recorded in other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower
contractual government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price, which we
record as allowances against accounts receivable.
Cash Discounts
We estimate cash discounts based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates and our expectations regarding future utilization rates.
Distributor Fees
Under our inventory management agreements with our significant U.S. wholesalers, we pay the wholesalers a fee primarily for the compliance of certain
contractually determined covenants such as the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels. These distributor fees are based on a contractually determined fixed
percentage of sales.
Product Returns
We do not provide our customers with a general right of product return, but permit returns if the product is damaged or defective when received by the
customer, or in the case of product sold in the Unites States and certain international countries, if the product has expired. We will accept returns for product that will
expire within six months prior to or that have expired up to one year after their expiration dates. Our estimates for expected returns of expired products are based
primarily on an ongoing analysis of historical return patterns.
Royalty Revenues
Royalty revenue from sales of Lexiscan and AmBisome by Astellas Pharma US, Inc. (Astellas) is recognized in the month following the month in which the
corresponding sales occur. Royalty revenue from sales of our other products is generally recognized when received, which is generally in the quarter following the
quarter in which the corresponding sales occur.
Contract and Other Revenues
Revenue from non-refundable up-front license fees and milestone payments such as under a development collaboration or an obligation to supply product, is
recognized as performance occurs and our obligations are
84Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
completed. In accordance with the specific terms of Gilead’s obligations under these arrangements, revenue is recognized as the obligation is fulfilled or ratably over
the development or manufacturing period. Revenue associated with substantive at-risk milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as
defined in the respective agreements. Advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Shipping and handling costs incurred for inventory purchases and product shipments are recorded in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of
Income.
Research and Development Expenses
Major components of research and development (R&D) expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation,
clinical studies performed by contract research organizations (CROs), materials and supplies, licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various
support and facilities related costs. Our R&D activities are also separated into three main categories: research, clinical development and pharmaceutical development.
Research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs. Clinical development costs include costs for Phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 clinical trials. Pharmaceutical
development expenses consist of costs for product formulation and chemical analysis.
We charge R&D costs, including clinical study costs, to expense when incurred. Clinical study costs are a significant component of R&D expenses. Most of
our clinical studies are performed by third party CROs. We monitor levels of performance under each significant contract including the extent of patient enrollment
and other activities through communications with our CROs, and we accrue costs for clinical studies to reflect the level of effort actually incurred by each CRO.
All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO and certain
non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination. Amounts paid in advance related to uncompleted services will be refunded to us if a contract is
terminated. Some contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract. Such additional termination
payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated.
Advertising Expenses
We expense the costs of advertising, including promotional expenses, as incurred. Advertising expenses were $108.1 million in 2009, $96.2 million in 2008 and
$81.1 million in 2007.
Net Income Per Share Attributable to Gilead Common Stockholders
Basic net income per share attributable to Gilead common stockholders is calculated based on the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share attributable to Gilead common stockholders is calculated based on the weighted-average number of
shares of our common stock outstanding and other dilutive securities outstanding during the period. The potential dilutive shares of our common stock resulting
from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and equivalents (consisting primarily of performance shares) and the assumed exercise of warrants relating to
the Notes are determined under the treasury stock method.
85Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Because the principal amount of the Notes will be settled in cash, only the conversion spread relating to the Notes is included in our calculation of diluted net
income per share attributable to Gilead common stockholders. Our common stock resulting from the assumed settlement of the conversion spread of the Notes has a
dilutive effect when the average market price of our common stock during the period exceeds the conversion prices of $38.75 and $38.10 for the 2011 Notes and 2013
Notes, respectively. For the years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007, the average market price of our common stock exceeded both of the conversion prices of our Notes and
the dilutive effect is included in the table below.
Warrants relating to the 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes have a dilutive effect when the average market price of our common stock during the period exceeds the
warrants’ exercise prices of $50.80 and $53.90, respectively. The average market price of our common stock during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007
did not exceed the warrants’ exercise prices relating to the Notes.
Stock options to purchase approximately 17.4 million, 11.4 million and 15.5 million weighted-average shares of our common stock were outstanding during the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share attributable to Gilead common
stockholders because the options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common stock during these periods; therefore, their effect was
antidilutive.
The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share attributable to Gilead
common stockholders (in thousands):
Year Ended December 31,
2009 2008 2007

Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding used in the calculation of diluted net income per
share attributable to Gilead common stockholders 934,109 958,825 964,356
Stock-Based Compensation
On January 1, 2006, we adopted guidance for our share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options. The guidance requires
that share-based payments to employees be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income based on their fair values. The guidance also requires the benefit
of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing activity, rather than as an
operating activity. We applied the modified prospective method, which requires that compensation expenses be recorded for the vesting of all non-vested stock
options and other stock-based awards at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption. In addition, we calculated our pool of excess tax benefits available within
additional paid-in capital (APIC) in accordance with the provisions of this guidance.
86Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and an original maturity of three months or less on the purchase date to be cash
equivalents. We may enter into overnight repurchase agreements (repos) under which we purchase securities with an obligation to resell them the following day.
Securities purchased under agreements to resell are recorded at face value and reported as cash and cash equivalents. Under our investment policy, we may enter
into repos with major banks and authorized dealers provided that such repos are collateralized by U.S. government securities with a fair value of at least 102% of the
fair value of securities sold to us. Other eligible instruments under our investment policy that are included in cash equivalents include commercial paper, money
market funds and other bank obligations.
Marketable and Nonmarketable Securities
We determine the appropriate classification of our marketable securities, which consist primarily of debt securities and which include auction rate securities
and variable rate demand obligations, at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. All of our marketable securities are
considered as available-for-sale and carried at estimated fair values and reported in either cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities or long-term marketable
securities. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from net income and are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Interest and other income, net, includes interest, dividends, amortization of purchase premiums and
discounts, realized gains and losses on sales of securities and other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of securities, if any. The cost of securities sold is based
on the specific identification method. We regularly review all of our investments for other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Our review includes the consideration
of the cause of the impairment, including the creditworthiness of the security issuers, the number of securities in an unrealized loss position, the severity and
duration of the unrealized losses, whether we have the intent to sell the securities and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities
before the recovery of their amortized cost basis. When we determine that the decline in fair value of an investment is below our accounting basis and this decline is
other-than-temporary, we reduce the carrying value of the security we hold and record a loss for the amount of such decline.
As a result of entering into collaborations, from time to time, we may hold investments in non-public companies. We record these nonmarketable securities at
cost in other noncurrent assets, less any amounts for other-than-temporary impairment. We regularly review our securities for indicators of impairment. Investments
in nonmarketable securities are not material for the periods presented.
Concentrations of Risk
We are subject to credit risk from our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Under our investment policy, we limit amounts invested in such
securities by credit rating, maturity, industry group, investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. We are not exposed to any
significant concentrations of credit risk from these financial instruments. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: safety and
preservation of principal and diversification of risk; liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and a competitive after-tax rate of return.
We are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. The majority of our trade accounts receivable arises from product
sales in the United States and Europe. In certain countries where payments are typically slow, primarily Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, our aggregated accounts
receivable balance is significant. In most cases, slow payment practices in these countries reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers.
This, in turn, may increase the financial risk related to
87Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
certain of our customers. Sales to customers in these countries in Europe that tend to pay relatively slowly have increased, and may continue to further increase. At
December 31, 2009, our aggregate accounts receivable in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain totaled $753.6 million, of which $289.4 million was more than 120 days past
due based on contractual payment terms. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable and believe
that our past due accounts receivable, net of allowances, as reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are collectible.
Certain of the raw materials and components that we utilize in our operations are obtained through single suppliers. Certain of the raw materials that we utilize
in our operations are made at only one facility. Since the suppliers of key components and raw materials must be named in a new drug application (NDA) filed with
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a product, significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required. If delivery of material from
our suppliers were interrupted for any reason, we may be unable to ship our commercial products or to supply any of our product candidates for clinical trials.
Accounts Receivable
Trade accounts receivable are recorded net of allowances for wholesaler chargebacks related to government rebate programs, cash discounts for prompt
payment, doubtful accounts and sales returns. Estimates for wholesaler chargebacks for government rebates, cash discounts and sales returns are based on
contractual terms, historical trends and our expectations regarding the utilization rates for these programs. Estimates for our allowance for doubtful accounts is
determined based on existing contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days
sales outstanding by customer and geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and
reimbursement practices. Historically, the amounts of uncollectible accounts receivable that have been written off have been insignificant and consistent with
management’s expectations.
Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. We periodically review the composition of our
inventories in order to identify obsolete, slow-moving or otherwise unsaleable items. If unsaleable items are observed and there are no alternate uses for the
inventory, we will record a write-down to net realizable value in the period that the impairment is first recognized.
Prepaid Royalties
Prepaid royalties are capitalized at cost which initially is equivalent to the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to the
licensor on expected future levels of product sales incorporating the related technology. We review periodically the expected future sales levels of our products and
any indicators that might require a write-down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty. We amortize our
prepaid royalties to cost of goods sold over the remaining life of the underlying patent based on an effective royalty rate derived from forecasted future product sales
incorporating the related technology. We review our effective royalty rate at least annually and prospectively adjust the effective rate based on significant new facts
or circumstances that may arise from our review.
Our prepaid royalties are primarily comprised of emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory University (Emory) for the HIV indication when we and Royalty
Pharma purchased the royalty interest owned by Emory in 2005. Under the terms of the transaction, we and Royalty Pharma paid 65% and 35%, respectively, of the
total
88Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
purchase price of $525.0 million to Emory in exchange for the elimination of the emtricitabine royalties due to Emory on worldwide net sales of products containing
emtricitabine. As a result of this transaction, we capitalized as prepaid royalties our 65% share of the $525.0 million purchase price, or $341.3 million. As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had an unamortized prepaid royalty asset of $245.0 million and $275.0 million, respectively. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, $29.9 million, $31.8
million and $14.3 million were amortized to cost of goods sold, respectively.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the
straight-line method. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Estimated useful lives in years are as follows:
Description Estimated Useful Life
Buildings and improvements 20-35
Laboratory and manufacturing equipment 4-10
Office and computer equipment 3-7
Leasehold improvements Shorter of useful life
or lease term
Office and computer equipment includes capitalized software. We had unamortized capitalized software costs of $25.2 million and $17.9 million on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Leasehold improvements and capitalized leased equipment are amortized over the
shorter of the lease term or the asset’s useful life. Amortization of capitalized leased equipment is included in depreciation expense. Capitalized interest on
construction in-progress is included in property, plant and equipment. Interest capitalized in 2009, 2008 and 2007 was not significant.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination. Other intangible assets primarily related to marketed products and purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects from our
acquisition of CV Therapeutics, Inc. (CV Therapeutics) in April 2009, and are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. We do not amortize
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and
in between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the assets below
their carrying amounts.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest
that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to the Ranexa product, which we acquired from CV
Therapeutics, over its estimated useful life using an amortization rate derived from our forecasted future product sales for Ranexa. Our product sales forecasts are
prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake
of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and
significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, we will prospectively update the rate used to amortize our intangible asset related to Ranexa which may increase
future cost of goods sold, as that is where we record the amortization expense. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to the Lexiscan
89Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
product, which we also acquired from CV Therapeutics, over its estimated useful life to cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis. Given that current Lexiscan
revenues consist of royalties received from a collaboration partner and we will have limited ongoing access and visibility into that partner’s future sales forecasts, we
cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amortization rate utilizing a forecasted product sales approach.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The carrying value of long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances both internally and externally that may
suggest impairment. Specific potential indicators of impairment include a significant decrease in the fair value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner
in which an asset is used or a significant physical change in an asset, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that affects the value of
an asset, an adverse action or assessment by the FDA or another regulator, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to
acquire or construct an asset and operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates
continuing losses associated with an income producing asset.
Should there be an indication of impairment, we will test for recoverability by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from
the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition to the carrying amount of the asset or asset group. Any excess of the carrying value of the asset or
asset group over its estimated fair value will be recognized as an impairment loss.
Foreign Currency Translation, Transactions and Contracts
Adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars are excluded from the determination of net income
and are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Net foreign currency exchange transaction
gains or losses are included in interest and other income, net, on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Net transaction gains (losses) totaled $(16.4) million, $(36.5)
million and $11.4 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
We hedge certain of our foreign currency exposures related to outstanding monetary assets and liabilities and forecasted product sales with foreign currency
exchange forward contracts and foreign currency exchange option contracts. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and
losses on the transactions being hedged. Our exposure to credit risk from these contracts is a function of changes in interest and currency exchange rates and,
therefore, varies over time. We limit the risk that counterparties to these contracts may be unable to perform by transacting only with major banks, all of which we
monitor closely in the context of current market conditions. We also limit risk of loss by entering into contracts that provide for net settlement at maturity. Therefore,
our overall risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is limited to the amount of any unrecognized gains on outstanding contracts (i.e., those contracts that
have a positive fair value) at the date of default. We do not enter into speculative foreign currency transactions. We do not hedge our net investment in any of our
foreign subsidiaries.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Our financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, foreign currency exchange forward and
option contracts, accounts payable and long-term debt. Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency exchange contracts that hedge
accounts receivable and forecasted sales are reported at their respective fair values on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying value and fair value of the
Notes were $1.16 billion and $1.58 billion, respectively, as of
90Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
December 31, 2009. The carrying value and fair value of the Notes were $1.10 billion and $1.76 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2008. The fair value of the
Notes was based on their quoted market values. The remaining financial instruments are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at amounts that approximate
current fair values.
Income Taxes
Our income tax provision is computed under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Significant estimates are
required in determining our provision for income taxes. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Various factors may
have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and
rates, the accounting for stock options and other share-based payments, mergers and acquisitions, future levels of R&D spending, changes in accounting standards,
changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings and resolution of federal, state and
foreign income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be significant and could have a negative impact on
our consolidated net income.
We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized
in an enterprise’s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material
adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a
material impact on the results of operations for that period.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2009, the FASB issued amended standards for determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity under ASC section 810-10-25. These
amended standards eliminate a mandatory quantitative approach to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable
interest entity in favor of a qualitatively focused analysis, and require an ongoing reassessment of whether the entity is a primarily beneficiary. The amended
standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2010. We have been consolidating our joint ventures with BMS because we are the primary
beneficiary. We are still evaluating whether the revised standard will have any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In October 2009, the FASB issued new standards for revenue recognition for agreements with multiple deliverables. These new standards impact the
determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting. Additionally, these new
standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual
method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2011, however early adoption is
permitted. We have not yet evaluated whether these new standards will have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
2. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
On January 1, 2008, we adopted guidance for fair value measurements on a prospective basis for our financial assets and liabilities as well as for non-financial
assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at
91Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
fair value on a recurring basis. The guidance defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosure requirements regarding
fair value measurements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 for financial assets and liabilities as well as for non-financial
assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2008 for all other non-financial assets and liabilities. On January 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of this guidance on a prospective basis for our non-
financial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. The adoption of the guidance had no effect on our consolidated
net income for the year ended December 31, 2009.
The fair value guidance requires that we determine the fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy established in
the guidance and describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, as follows:
Level 1 inputs which include quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 inputs which include observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices for identical or
similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full
term of the asset or liability; and
Level 3 inputs which include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the underlying
asset or liability. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies
or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.
The following table summarizes, for assets or liabilities recorded at fair value, the respective fair value and the classification by level of input within the fair
value hierarchy defined above (in thousands):

Marketable securities, measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs, are primarily comprised of U.S. Government sponsored and corporate debt securities. The
company reviews trading activity and pricing for these investments as of the measurement date. When sufficient quoted pricing for identical securities is not
available, the company uses market pricing and other observable market inputs for similar securities obtained from various third party data providers. These inputs
represent quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or these inputs have been derived from observable market data. This approach results in the classification
of these securities as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The following table is a reconciliation of marketable securities measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in thousands):
Year Ended December 31,
2009 2008
Balance, beginning of period $ 102,633 $ 7,258
Total realized and unrealized gains (losses) included in:
Interest and other income, net (29) (2,406)
Other comprehensive income, net 10,332 (20,601)
Sales of marketable securities (7,274) (39,317)
Transfers into Level 3 — 157,699
Balance, end of period $ 105,662 $ 102,633
Total losses included in interest and other income, net attributable to the change in unrealized losses relating to assets
still held at the reporting date $ (29) $ (2,731)
Marketable securities, measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs, are substantially comprised of auction rate securities within our available-for-sale
investment portfolio. The underlying assets of our auction rate securities are comprised of student loans. Although auction rate securities would typically be
measured using Level 2 inputs, the failure of auctions and the lack of market activity and liquidity experienced since the beginning of 2008 required that these
securities be measured using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of our auction rate securities was determined using a discounted cash flow model that considered
projected cash flows for the issuing trusts, underlying collateral and expected yields. Projected cash flows were estimated based on the underlying loan principal,
bonds outstanding and payout formulas. The weighted-average life over which the cash flows were projected considered the collateral composition of the securities
and related historical and projected prepayments. The underlying student loans have a weighted-average expected life of four to eight years. The discount rates used
in our discounted cash flow model were based on market conditions for comparable or similar term asset-backed securities as well as other fixed income securities
adjusted for an illiquidity discount resulting in an annual discount rate of 2.3%. Our auction rate securities reset every seven to 35 days with maturity dates ranging
from 2023 through 2041 and have annual interest rates ranging from 0.4% to 1.2%. As of December 31, 2009, our auction rate securities continued to earn interest.
In April 2009, the FASB also issued additional guidance on estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly
decreased in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability and is applicable to the valuation of auction rate securities held by us for which there was no
active market as of December 31, 2009.
Our auction rate securities were recorded in long-term marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Although
there continued to be failed auctions as well as lack of market activity and liquidity in 2009, we believe we had no other-than-temporary impairments on these
securities as of December 31, 2009 because we do not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities
before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the gross unrealized losses were primarily the result of an increase in the yield-to-maturity of the underlying securities, and
were approximately 32% and 29%, respectively, of the total number of securities in an unrealized loss position. In the case of auction rate securities, gross unrealized
losses were caused by a higher discount rate used in the valuation of these securities as compared to the coupon rates of these securities. No significant facts or
circumstances have arisen to indicate that there has been any deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuers of these securities. Based on our review of these
securities, we believe we had no other-than-temporary impairments on these securities as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 because we do not intend to sell these
securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.
4. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
On January 1, 2009, we adopted guidance for derivative instruments, on a prospective basis, which requires enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures
to enable financial statement users to better understand the effects of derivatives and hedging on an entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows
in the context of an entity’s risk exposures.
We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and
various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro. In order to manage the risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we hedge
certain of our foreign currency exposures related to outstanding monetary assets and liabilities and forecasted product sales with foreign currency exchange forward
contracts and foreign currency exchange option contracts. In general, the market risks of our foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by corresponding gains
and losses on the transactions being hedged. Our exposure to credit risk from these contracts is a function of changes in interest and currency exchange rates and,
therefore, varies over time. We limit the risk that counterparties to these contracts may be unable to perform by transacting only with major banks, all of which we
monitor closely in the context of current market conditions. We also limit risk of loss by entering into contracts that provide for net settlement at maturity. Therefore,
our overall risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is limited to the amount of any unrecognized gains on outstanding contracts (i.e., those contracts that
have a positive fair value) at the date of default. We do not enter into derivative financial contracts for trading purposes. We do not hedge our net investment in any
of our foreign subsidiaries.
We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge our market risk exposure associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain
monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in a non-functional currency. As these derivative instruments are not designated as
hedges, we record the changes in the fair value of such instruments in interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge forecasted product sales are designated as cash flow hedges. These derivative instruments are employed
to eliminate or minimize certain foreign currency exposures that can be confidently identified and quantified, all with maturities of 18 months or less. At the inception
of a hedging relationship and on a quarterly basis, we assess hedge effectiveness on a prospective basis by performing a regression analysis taking the change in
cash flow of the underlying contract and regressing it against the change in cash flow of the hedge instrument. We assess hedge effectiveness on a retrospective
basis using a dollar offset approach monthly. We exclude time value from our effectiveness testing and recognize changes in the time value of the hedge in interest
and other income, net. The effective component of the hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) within stockholders’ equity as an
unrealized gain or loss on the hedging instrument. When the hedged forecasted transactions occur, the hedges are de-designated and the
96Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
unrealized gains and losses are reclassified into product sales. The majority of gains and losses related to the hedged forecasted transactions reported in
accumulated OCI at December 31, 2009 will be reclassified to product sales within 12 months.
We had notional amounts on foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts outstanding of $3.45 billion and $2.39 billion at December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively.

5. ACQUISITIONS
CV Therapeutics, Inc.
On January 1, 2009 we adopted guidance for recognizing and measuring assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree in
a business combination. The guidance also provides clarification for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination; requires IPR&D to be
97Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
capitalized at fair value as intangible assets at the time of acquisition; requires acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs to be recognized separately from
the business combination; expands the definition of what constitutes a business; and requires the acquirer to disclose information that users may need to evaluate
and understand the financial effect of the business combination. We adopted the provisions of this guidance on a prospective basis and applied it to our acquisition
of CV Therapeutics as discussed below.
On April 15, 2009, we acquired CV Therapeutics through a cash tender offer under the terms of an agreement and plan of merger entered into in March 2009. CV
Therapeutics was a publicly-held biopharmaceutical company based in Palo Alto, California, primarily focused on the discovery, development and commercialization
of small molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic and pulmonary diseases. CV Therapeutics had two marketed products, Ranexa for the treatment
of chronic angina and Lexiscan injection for use as a pharmacologic stress agent in radionuclide MPI in patients unable to undergo adequate exercise stress. CV
Therapeutics also had several product candidates in clinical development for the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic and pulmonary diseases. We believe the
acquisition will provide us with an opportunity to further expand into the cardiovascular therapeutic area.
The CV Therapeutics acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The results of operations of CV Therapeutics since April 15, 2009 have been
included in our Consolidated Statement of Income, and were not significant. The acquisition date was determined to be April 15, 2009 as that is the date on which we
acquired approximately 89% of the outstanding shares of common stock of CV Therapeutics and obtained effective control of the company. The acquisition was
completed two days later on April 17, 2009, at which time CV Therapeutics became a wholly-owned subsidiary.
The aggregate consideration transferred to acquire CV Therapeutics was $1.39 billion, and consisted of cash paid for common stock and other equity
instruments at or prior to closing of $1.38 billion and the fair value of vested stock options assumed of $15.7 million.
In accordance with the merger agreement, the number of Gilead stock options and restricted stock units into which assumed CV Therapeutics’ stock options
and restricted stock units were converted was determined based on the option conversion ratio. This conversion ratio was calculated by taking the per share
acquisition price of $20.00 and dividing it by the average closing price of our common stock for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding (but not
including) the closing date of April 17, 2009, which was $46.24 per share. The fair value of stock options assumed was calculated using a Black-Scholes valuation
model with the following assumptions: market price of $44.54 per share, which was the closing price of our common stock on the acquisition date; expected term
ranging from 0.1 to 5.2 years; risk-free interest rate ranging from 0.1% to 1.7%; expected volatility ranging from 37.4% to 43.2%; and no dividend yield. The fair value
of restricted stock units assumed was calculated using the acquisition-date closing price of $44.54 per share for our common stock.
We included the fair value of vested stock options assumed by us of $15.7 million in the consideration transferred for the acquisition. There were no vested
restricted stock units assumed by us. The estimated fair value of unvested stock options and restricted stock units assumed by us of $11.2 million was not included
in the consideration transferred and is being recognized as stock-based compensation expenses over the remaining future vesting period of the awards.

During the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded a balance sheet reclassification which reduced intangible assets related to IPR&D by $41.2 million, reduced our
deferred tax liabilities by $16.1 million and increased goodwill by $25.1 million. This reclassification resulted from the discovery of information which affected the
initial valuation of certain of our IPR&D intangible assets acquired from CV Therapeutics.
Intangible Assets
A substantial portion of the assets acquired consisted of intangible assets related to CV Therapeutics’ two marketed products, Ranexa and Lexiscan, and CV
Therapeutics’ IPR&D projects. Management determined that the estimated acquisition-date fair values of the intangible assets related to the marketed products and
IPR&D projects were $951.2 million and $138.9 million, respectively.
Of the $951.2 million of intangible assets related to the marketed products, $688.4 million related to Ranexa and $262.8 million related to Lexiscan. We have
determined that these intangible assets have finite useful lives and will be amortized over their respective useful lives, which we estimated to be the periods over
which the associated product patents will expire as those are the periods over which the intangible assets are expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the
related products.
We are amortizing the intangible asset related to Ranexa over its estimated useful life using an amortization rate derived from our forecasted future product
sales for Ranexa. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to Lexiscan over its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. Given that current Lexiscan revenues
consist of royalties received from a collaboration partner and we will have limited ongoing access and visibility into that partner’s future sales forecasts, we cannot
make a reasonable estimate of the amortization rate utilizing a forecasted product sales approach. The weighted-average amortization period for these intangible
assets is approximately ten years.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Of the $138.9 million of intangible assets related to the IPR&D projects, $93.4 million related to GS 9667 (formerly CVT-3619), a product candidate in Phase 1
clinical studies for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. The remaining balance of the intangible assets related to IPR&D projects represented various other in-
process projects with no single project comprising a significant portion of the total value. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered to be indefinite-
lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they will not be amortized but
will be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would
indicate a reduction in the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. If and when development is complete, which generally occurs if
and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then be amortized based on their
respective estimated useful lives at that point in time.
The estimated fair value of the intangible assets related to the marketed products and IPR&D projects was determined using the income approach, which
discounts expected future cash flows to present value. We estimated the fair value of these intangible assets using a present value discount rate of 9%, which is
based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles substantially similar to that of CV Therapeutics. This is comparable to the
estimated internal rate of return for CV Therapeutics’ operations and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets. For the
intangible assets related to the IPR&D projects, we compensated for the differing phases of development of each project by probability-adjusting our estimation of
the expected future cash flows associated with each project. We then determined the present value of the expected future cash flows using the discount rate of 9%.
The projected cash flows from the IPR&D projects were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the projects
considering their stages of development; the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related product candidates; the life of the
potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining
marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.
Deferred Tax Assets and Deferred Tax Liabilities
The $413.8 million of deferred tax assets resulting from the acquisition was primarily related to federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
The $426.9 million of deferred tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition was primarily related to the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible
assets related to the marketed products and IPR&D projects. We have concluded that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefit from deferred tax
assets related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards. As a result, a valuation allowance of $15.1 million was recorded related to those deferred tax assets.
For presentation purposes, the $426.9 million of deferred tax liabilities, all of which is of a noncurrent nature, has been netted against noncurrent deferred tax assets
on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Convertible Senior Notes
As a result of the acquisition, we assumed convertible notes from CV Therapeutics consisting of 2.75% senior subordinated convertible notes due 2012, 3.25%
senior subordinated convertible notes due 2013 and 2.0% senior subordinated convertible debentures due 2023. All of these convertible notes were recognized at
their fair values at the acquisition date. In May 2009, we offered to repurchase these convertible notes in consideration for their par value plus accrued interest, as
required under the terms of the respective convertible note agreements following the occurrence of a change in control or fundamental change as defined in the
agreements. As of December 31, 2009, substantially all of these convertible notes have been extinguished.

Goodwill
The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was $341.9 million, which represents the
goodwill amount resulting from the acquisition. Management believes that the goodwill mainly represents the synergies and economies of scale expected from
combining our operations with CV Therapeutics. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. We recorded the goodwill as an
intangible asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if we
become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying amount.
Acquisition-Related Transaction Costs and Restructuring Expenses
We recognized $8.4 million of acquisition-related transaction costs in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the year ended December 31,
2009, which consisted primarily of investment banker fees, legal and accounting costs related to the acquisition. In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, we
approved a plan to realize certain synergies between CV Therapeutics and us, re-align our cardiovascular operations and eliminate certain redundancies. The
restructuring plan included consolidation and re-alignment of the cardiovascular R&D organization, our exit from certain facilities and the termination of certain
contractual obligations. As a result of this restructuring plan, we recorded $26.2 million and $25.7 million in SG&A expenses and R&D expenses, respectively, in 2009,
primarily related to employee severance, relocation and termination benefits, lease termination costs and other facilities-related expenses. We expect to incur an
additional $20.2 million in 2010 bringing the total amount to be incurred in connection with the significant activities of our restructuring plan to be approximately $38.8
million for employee severance, relocation and termination benefits and $33.3 million for facilities-related expenses.

Navitas Assets, LLC
In May 2008, we executed an asset purchase agreement with Navitas Assets, LLC (Navitas) to acquire all of the assets related to its cicletanine business. We
acquired the exclusive rights to regulatory data and filings for development of cicletanine as a monotherapy for PAH and for other indications in the United States.
We are evaluating cicletanine, currently in Phase 2 clinical trials, as a potential treatment of PAH.
The aggregate consideration transferred for the acquisition was $10.9 million, and consisted primarily of cash paid. In addition, Navitas is entitled to potential
additional purchase consideration, including payments contingent on future achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. These amounts will be
recorded when and if the related contingencies are resolved. The consideration transferred was allocated to IPR&D which represents the purchased IPR&D program
for cicletanine that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of the acquisition date, and therefore, was expensed upon
acquisition within our Consolidated Statement of Income.
Nycomed Limited
In September 2007, we completed the acquisition of Nycomed Limited (Nycomed), a wholly-owned Irish subsidiary of Germany-based pharmaceutical company,
Nycomed GmbH. The Nycomed facility, located in Cork, Ireland, conducted manufacturing and tableting operations for Nycomed GmbH. We transferred certain of our
manufacturing operations from our Dublin, Ireland area site to this facility and utilize the site primarily for solid dose tablet manufacturing of existing and future
products, as well as product packaging. The Nycomed acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination. The results of operations of Nycomed since
the acquisition date have been included in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
The aggregate consideration transferred for all of Nycomed’s common stock was $48.3 million, which consisted of cash paid at closing of $46.6 million,
estimated direct transaction costs of $1.0 million and employee-related severance costs of $0.7 million. Employee-related severance costs were capitalized as part of
the purchase price, as we established a workforce reduction plan as part of the acquisition transaction. These costs have been fully paid. The consideration
transferred was allocated primarily to property, plant and equipment of $48.5 million with the remaining balance allocated to net working capital.
In connection with the transfer of certain manufacturing operations from our Dublin, Ireland area site to the Cork facility, we finalized our personnel plan with
respect to our Dublin employees and recognized one-time termination benefits of $3.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.

9. COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS
As a result of entering into strategic collaborations from time to time, we may hold investments in non-public companies. We review our interests in our
investee companies for consolidation and/or appropriate disclosure based on applicable guidance. As of December 31, 2009, we determined that certain of our
investee companies are variable interest entities; however, other than with respect to our joint ventures with BMS, we are not the primary beneficiary and therefore
do not consolidate these investees.
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
North America
In December 2004, we entered into a collaboration with BMS in the United States to develop and commercialize a single tablet regimen containing our Truvada
and BMS’s Sustiva (efavirenz), which we sell as Atripla. The collaboration is structured as a joint venture and operates as a limited liability company named Bristol-
Myers Squibb & Gilead Sciences, LLC, which we consolidate. The ownership interests of the joint venture and thus the sharing of product revenue and costs reflect
the respective economic interests of BMS and us and are based on the proportions of the net selling price of Atripla attributable to efavirenz and Truvada. Since the
net selling price for Truvada may change over time relative to the net selling price of efavirenz, both BMS’s and our respective economic interests in the joint venture
may vary annually.
We share marketing and sales efforts with BMS and both parties are obligated to provide equivalent sales force efforts for a minimum number of years. We are
responsible for accounting, financial reporting, tax reporting and product distribution for the joint venture. Both parties provide their respective bulk active
pharmaceutical ingredients to the joint venture at their approximate market values. In July 2006, the joint venture received approval from the FDA to sell Atripla in the
United States. In September 2006, we and BMS amended the joint venture’s collaboration agreement to allow the joint venture to sell Atripla into Canada and in
October 2007, the joint venture received approval from Health Canada to sell Atripla in Canada. As December 31, 2009 and 2008, the joint venture held efavirenz active
pharmaceutical ingredient which it purchased from BMS at BMS’s estimated net selling price of efavirenz in the U.S. market. These amounts are included in
inventories on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, total assets held by the joint venture were $1.40 billion and $1.07 billion,
respectively, and consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable (including intercompany receivables with Gilead) and inventories. As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, total liabilities held by the joint venture were $1.03 billion and $548.0 million, respectively, and consisted primarily of accounts payable
(including intercompany payables with Gilead) and other accrued expenses. These asset and liability amounts do not reflect the impact of intercompany eliminations
that are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although we are the primary beneficiary of the joint venture, the legal structure of the joint venture limits the
recourse that its creditors will have over our general credit or assets.
Europe
In December 2007, Gilead Sciences Limited (GSL), one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Ireland, and BMS entered into a collaboration arrangement to
commercialize and distribute Atripla in the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (collectively, the European Territory). The parties formed
a limited liability company which we consolidate, to manufacture Atripla for distribution in the European Territory using efavirenz that it purchases from BMS at
BMS’s estimated net selling price of efavirenz in the European Territory. We are responsible for product distribution, inventory management and warehousing.
Through our local subsidiaries, we have primary responsibility for order fulfillment, collection of receivables, customer relations and handling of sales returns in all
the territories where we co-promote Atripla with BMS. We are also responsible for accounting, financial reporting and tax reporting for the collaboration. In December
2007, the
105Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
European Commission approved Atripla for sale in the European Union. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, efavirenz purchased from BMS at BMS’s estimated net
selling price of efavirenz in the European Territory is included in inventories on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The parties also formed a limited liability company to hold the marketing authorization for Atripla in Europe. We have primary responsibility for regulatory
activities and we share marketing and sales efforts with BMS. In the major market countries, both parties have agreed to provide equivalent sales force efforts.
Revenue and cost sharing is based on the relative ratio of the respective net selling prices of Truvada and efavirenz.
PARI GmbH
As a result of our acquisition of Corus Pharma, Inc. (Corus) in August 2006, we assumed all rights to the February 2002 development agreement between Corus
and PARI GmbH (PARI) for the development of Cayston and development of an inhalation delivery device for this product. Under the terms of the agreement, we are
obligated to pay PARI for services rendered, and subject to the achievement of specific milestones, we are obligated to pay certain milestone payments to PARI. In
addition, we will make royalty payments based on net sales of Cayston. The agreement also provided us the right to reduce the royalty rate payable to PARI. In
November 2007, we paid PARI $13.5 million to reduce the royalty rate under the agreement. As Cayston had not yet been approved for commercialization as of
December 31, 2009, we recorded this payment in R&D expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income. In April 2008, pursuant to the February 2002 development
agreement, we entered into a commercialization agreement with PARI which provides for the supply and manufacture of an inhalation delivery device and accessories
for use with Cayston. Under the terms of this agreement, we are obligated to pay royalties on future net sales of these products pursuant to the 2002 development
agreement.
In February 2010, we received marketing approval from the FDA for Cayston as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in CF patients with Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). Cayston was conditionally approved in Europe and Canada in September 2009.
LG Life Sciences, Ltd.
In November 2007, we entered into a license agreement with LG Life Sciences, Ltd. (LGLS) to develop and commercialize certain caspase inhibitors for the
treatment of fibrotic diseases. The agreement granted us commercialization rights to LGLS’s caspase inhibitors, including GS 9450 (formerly LB84451). Under the
terms of the agreement, our license is worldwide, with the exception of Korea, China and India where LGLS has retained rights. LGLS also retains the right to develop
and commercialize caspase inhibitors for ophthalmic and topical uses worldwide. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we paid a $20.0 million up-front
license fee that was recorded in R&D expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income as there was no future alternative use for this technology. The agreement
also obligated us to fund a collaborative research program for two years to identify other potential caspase inhibitor drug candidates. In addition, we are obligated to
make additional milestone payments of up to $182.0 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial objectives. We are also
obligated to pay royalties on future net sales of products that are developed and approved in relation to this collaboration.
Parion Sciences, Inc.
In August 2007, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Parion Sciences, Inc. (Parion) to research, develop and commercialize
certain epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) inhibitors for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. The agreement granted us worldwide commercialization rights to GS 9411
106Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
(formerly P-680), an ENaC inhibitor discovered by Parion, for the treatment of pulmonary diseases, including CF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and non-CF
bronchiectasis. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we paid a $5.0 million up-front license fee that was recorded in R&D expenses in our Consolidated
Statement of Income as there was no future alternative use for this technology, and made a $5.0 million investment in Parion in the form of convertible debt, which
was recorded as other noncurrent assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under the collaboration agreement, we will lead all development and commercialization
activities and provide funding of full time equivalent employees for certain research activities. In addition, we are obligated to make additional payments upon the
achievement of certain milestones and pay royalties on future net sales of products that are developed and approved in relation to this collaboration.
Roche
In September 1996, we entered into a development and license agreement (the 1996 Agreement) with Roche to develop and commercialize therapies to treat and
prevent viral influenza. Tamiflu, an antiviral oral formulation for the treatment and prevention of influenza, was co-developed by us and Roche. Under the 1996
Agreement, Roche has the exclusive right to manufacture and sell Tamiflu worldwide, subject to its obligation to pay us a percentage of the net revenues that Roche
generates from Tamiflu sales, which, in turn, has been subject to reduction for certain defined manufacturing costs.
In November 2005, we entered into a first amendment and supplement to the 1996 Agreement with Roche. The amended agreement provided for the formation
of a joint manufacturing committee to review Roche’s manufacturing capacity for Tamiflu and its global plans for manufacturing Tamiflu, a U.S. commercial committee
to evaluate commercial plans and strategies for Tamiflu in the United States and a joint supervisory committee to evaluate Roche’s overall commercial plans for
Tamiflu on a global basis in each case, consisting of representatives of Roche and us. Under the amended agreement, we also have the option to provide a
specialized sales force to supplement Roche’s marketing efforts in the United States for Tamiflu.
The royalties payable to us on net sales of Tamiflu sold by Roche remain the same under the amended agreement, which are as follows: (a) 14% of the first
$200.0 million in worldwide net sales in a given calendar year; (b) 18% of the next $200.0 million in worldwide net sales during the same calendar year; and (c) 22% of
worldwide net sales in excess of $400.0 million during the same calendar year. The amended agreement revised the provision in the 1996 Agreement relating to the
calculation of royalty payments such that in any given calendar quarter Roche will pay royalties based on the actual royalty rates applicable to such quarter. In
addition, under the amended agreement, royalties payable by Roche to us will no longer be subject to a cost of goods sold adjustment that was provided in the 1996
Agreement. We recorded a total of $392.7 million, $155.5 million and $414.5 million of Tamiflu royalties in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
As a result of our acquisition of CV Therapeutics in April 2009, we assumed all rights to the agreement between CV Therapeutics and Roche under which we
have an exclusive worldwide license to Ranexa. Under the license agreement, we paid an initial license fee and are obligated to make certain payments to Roche upon
receipt of the first and second product approvals for Ranexa in any of the following major market countries: France, Germany, Italy, the United States and the United
Kingdom. In January 2006, we received FDA approval for Ranexa for the treatment of chronic angina and paid $11.0 million to Roche in accordance with the
agreement. In July 2008, we received marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) for Ranexa for the treatment of chronic angina in all 27
European Union member states and paid $9.0 million to Roche related to this approval. This amount was capitalized as a noncurrent asset on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet and is being amortized over its useful patent life, which is approximately 11 years, expiring in September 2019.
107Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
In June 2006, we entered into an amendment to the agreement with Roche related to Ranexa. This amendment provided us with exclusive worldwide commercial
rights to Ranexa for all potential indications in humans. Under the terms of the amendment, we made an upfront payment to Roche and are obligated to make royalty
payments to Roche on worldwide net product sales of any licensed products. In addition, we are obligated to make additional milestone payments upon the
achievement of certain regulatory approvals.
Japan Tobacco Inc.
In March 2005, Japan Tobacco Inc. (Japan Tobacco) granted us exclusive rights to develop and commercialize elvitegravir, a novel HIV integrase inhibitor
known as GS 9137, in all countries of the world, excluding Japan, where Japan Tobacco retained such rights. Under the terms of the agreement, we incurred an up-
front license fee of $15.0 million which was included in R&D expenses in 2005 as there was no future alternative use for this technology. In March 2006, we recorded
$5.0 million in R&D expenses related to a milestone we incurred as a result of dosing the first patient in a Phase 2 clinical study and in July 2008, we recorded $7.0
million in R&D expenses related to a milestone we paid related to the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical study. We are obligated to make additional
payments upon the achievement of other milestones as well as pay royalties on any future product sales arising from this collaboration.
GlaxoSmithKline Inc.
In April 2002, we granted GSK the right to commercialize Hepsera, our oral antiviral for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, in Asia, Latin America and certain
other territories. Under the agreement, we retained rights to Hepsera in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Turkey. GSK received
exclusive rights to develop Hepsera solely for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in all of its territories, the most significant of which include China, Japan, South
Korea and Taiwan. GSK has full responsibility for the development and commercialization of Hepsera in its territories. Under the terms of the agreement, we received
an up-front license payment of $10.0 million and from 2002 to 2004, we received an aggregate of $17.0 million in milestone payments related to the commercial
approvals of Hepsera in various countries. In 2006, we received an aggregate of $10.0 million in milestone payments from GSK for the achievement by GSK of four
consecutive quarters of Hepsera gross sales exceeding $75.0 million and the achievement of a certain drug status in China. The up-front license fee and milestone
payments had been recorded as deferred revenue with a total of $3.4 million and $3.6 million being amortized into contract revenue in 2008 and 2007, respectively.
During the first quarter of 2009, we terminated our supply agreement with GSK to allow GSK to assume all manufacturing and supply obligations for Hepsera for use
in the GSK territories. As a result of the termination of this supply agreement, we recognized the remaining $24.5 million balance of deferred revenue into contract
revenue as of March 31, 2009. Under the terms of the agreement, GSK is also required to pay us royalties on net sales that GSK generates from sales of Hepsera and
Epivir-HBV/Zeffix (GSK’s hepatitis product) in the GSK territories. We recorded $32.4 million, $31.7 million and $28.8 million of royalty revenues in 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively.
In November 2009, we entered into an agreement with GSK to commercialize Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in five countries in Asia. Under the
agreement, we will retain exclusive rights for commercialization of Viread for chronic hepatitis B in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. In China, GSK
will have exclusive commercialization rights for Viread for chronic hepatitis B. Each company will pay royalties to the other on sales of Viread for chronic hepatitis B in
their respective Asian territories.
As a result of our acquisition of Myogen, Inc. (Myogen) in November 2006, we assumed all rights to the March 2006 license and distribution and supply
agreements between Myogen and GSK. Under the terms of the license agreement, we sublicensed to GSK exclusive rights to market ambrisentan (the active
pharmaceutical
ingredient in Letairis, which is marketed under the name Volibris in territories outside the United States) for
108Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
PAH in territories outside of the United States. We received an up-front payment of $20.0 million and, subject to the achievement of specific milestones, we are
eligible to receive total additional milestone payments of $80.0 million. In addition, we will receive royalties based on net sales of Volibris in the GSK territories. GSK
has an option to negotiate from us an exclusive sublicense for additional therapeutic uses for Volibris in the GSK territories during the term of the license agreement.
We will continue to conduct and bear the expense of all clinical development activities that we believe are required to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for
Letairis and Volibris in the United States, Canada and the European Economic Area, and each party may conduct additional development activities in its territories at
its own expense. The parties may agree to jointly develop ambrisentan for new indications in the licensed field and each party will pay its share of external costs
associated with such joint development. In 2007, we received a milestone payment of $11.0 million from GSK for validation by the EMEA of the marketing
authorization application for Volibris, and in 2008, we received a $20.0 million milestone payment related to the European Commission marketing authorization
approval for Volibris. The milestone and up-front license payments have been recorded as deferred revenue and are being amortized into contract revenue over the
remaining period for which we have performance obligations under the agreement, which is approximately six years. We amortized $8.3 million, $5.0 million and $3.9
million to contract revenue in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Menarini International Operations Luxembourg SA
As a result of our acquisition of CV Therapeutics in April 2009, we assumed all rights to the September 2008 license agreement between CV Therapeutics and
Menarini under which we granted Menarini exclusive rights to Ranexa in the European Union and other specified countries for consideration including an upfront
payment of $70.0 million. The licensed territory encompasses 68 countries, including the 27 member states of the European Union, Russia and the other member states
of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and select countries in Central and South America. The term of the agreement expires on a country-by-country basis
upon the later to occur of ten years from the first commercial sale date of Ranexa in the country or the expiration of the last valid claim in the licensed patents covering
ranolazine in the country.
In addition, Menarini may make additional payments and investments for commercial and development milestones and promotional and detailing commitments.
The commercial milestones are primarily related to the achievement of certain sales levels and development milestones are related to the approval of Ranexa in Europe
for certain additional indications that are jointly developed. The agreement provides mechanisms for the parties to collaborate and share costs of joint development
programs for Ranexa in which Menarini elects to participate. We are also entitled to receive royalties on sales of Ranexa in the territories covered by the agreement.
Astellas US LLC and Astellas Pharma US, Inc. (Astellas), as applicable
As a result of our acquisition of CV Therapeutics in April 2009, we assumed all rights to the July 2000 collaboration agreement between CV Therapeutics and
Astellas US LLC to develop and market second generation pharmacologic MPI stress agents. Under this agreement, Astellas received exclusive North American
rights to Lexiscan and to a backup compound. In April 2008, we received FDA approval of Lexiscan for use as a pharmacologic stress agent in MPI studies in patients
unable to undergo adequate exercise stress. Under the terms of the agreement, the product is marketed by Astellas and was launched in June 2008 in the United
States. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $19.7 million of royalty revenue from Astellas related to sales of Lexiscan.
Since 1991, we have had an agreement with Astellas Pharma US, Inc. related to rights to market AmBisome. Under the terms of the agreement, Astellas is
responsible for promotion of AmBisome in the United States and Canada. We have exclusive marketing rights to AmBisome in the rest of the world, subject to our
109Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
obligation to pay royalties to Astellas in connection with sales in significant markets in Asia. We receive royalties from Astellas’ sales of AmBisome in the Unites
States and Canada. In connection with this agreement, we recorded royalty revenues of $9.4 million, $9.5 million and $10.4 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Tibotec Pharmaceuticals
In July 2009, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Tibotec Pharmaceuticals (Tibotec), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson,
to develop and commercialize a fixed-dose combination of our Truvada and Tibotec’s non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, TMC278 (25 mg rilpivirine
hydrochloride), which is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials. Under the agreement, Tibotec granted us an exclusive license to the combination product for
administration to adults in a once daily, oral dosage form, worldwide excluding developing world countries and Japan. Neither party is restricted from combining its
drug products with any other drugs.
In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we will reimburse up to €71.5 million (approximately $100.0 million) of development costs incurred by Tibotec for
TMC278 through December 2011, and we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and formulate the combination product, including the
completion of bioequivalence studies. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded $52.4 million in reimbursable R&D expenses incurred by Tibotec in the
development of TMC278. Tibotec is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop TMC278 and obtain its approval in the United States and Europe. We
will manufacture the combination product and assume the lead role in registration, distribution and, subject to regulatory approval, commercialization of the
combination product in the licensed countries. Tibotec will have the right to detail the combination product in the licensed countries, and, at its option, can request
that it be the distributor of the combination product in a limited number of such countries. The price of the combination product is expected to be the sum of the price
of Truvada and the price of TMC278 purchased separately. We expect to recognize product sales revenue from future sales of the combination product if and when it
is approved. The cost of TMC278 to be purchased by us from Tibotec for the combination product will approximate the market price of TMC278, less a specified
percentage of up to thirty percent.
10. LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS
Convertible Senior Notes
In April 2006, we issued $650.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2011 and $650.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes
due 2013 in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes were issued at par and bear
interest rates of 0.50% and 0.625%, respectively. Debt issuance costs of $23.8 million in connection with the issuance of the Notes were recorded in other noncurrent
assets and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the Notes. The 2011 Notes may be convertible into our
common stock based on an initial conversion rate of 25.8048 shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2011 Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of
approximately $38.75 per share). The 2013 Notes may be convertible into our common stock based on an initial conversion rate of 26.2460 shares per $1,000 principal
amount of 2013 Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $38.10 per share). The Notes may be converted, subject to adjustment, only
under the following circumstances: 1) during any calendar quarter beginning after September 30, 2006 if the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading
days during the last 30 consecutive trading day period of the previous quarter is more than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share, 2) if we make specified
distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate transactions occur, or 3) during the last month prior to maturity of the applicable Notes. Upon
conversion, a holder would
110Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
receive an amount in cash equal to the lesser of (i) the principal amount of the note or (ii) the conversion value for such note. If the conversion value exceeds $1,000,
we may also deliver, at our option, cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common stock for the conversion value in excess of $1,000. If the Notes are
converted in connection with a change in control, we may be required to provide a make whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate, subject to a
stated maximum amount. In addition, in the event of a change in control, the holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any.
As a result of adopting guidance relating to the Notes, we bifurcated the conversion option of the Notes from the debt instrument, classified the conversion
option in equity and are accreting the resulting debt discount as interest expense. The following table summarizes information about the equity and liability
components of the Notes (in thousands):
December 31,
2009 2008
Carrying amount of the equity component $ 340,712 $ 340,712
Net carrying amount of the liability component $ 1,155,266 $ 1,098,025
Unamortized discount of the liability component $ 144,588 $ 201,829
Total interest expense recognized for the Notes was $64.6 million, $61.5 million and $58.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. As of December 31, 2009, the effective interest rate on the liability component of the 2011 and 2013 Notes was 5.7% and 5.8%, respectively. If the notes
were converted as of December 31, 2009, the if-converted value would exceed the principal amounts of the 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes by $75.8 million and $88.2
million, respectively.
Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions at a cost of $379.1 million to cover, subject to
customary anti-dilution adjustments, 33.8 million shares of our common stock at strike prices that correspond to the initial conversion prices of the Notes. If the
market value per share of our common stock at the time of conversion of the Notes is above the strike price of the applicable convertible note hedges, we are entitled
to receive from the counterparties in the transactions cash or shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and common stock, at our option, for the excess
of the then market price of the common stock over the strike price of the convertible note hedges. The convertible note hedges will terminate upon the maturity of the
related Notes or when none of the related Notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. We also sold warrants to acquire 33.8 million shares of our
common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, in private transactions and received net proceeds of $235.5 million. If the market value of our common
stock at the time of the exercise of the applicable warrants exceeds their respective strike prices, we will be required to net settle in cash or shares of our common
stock, at our option, with the respective counterparties for the value of the warrants in excess of the warrant strike prices. The maximum number of shares of common
stock that could be issued by us should we choose to net share settle the warrants is 35.5 million shares, or 105% of the underlying share amount, which we have
reserved for potential future issuance. The warrants have strike prices of $50.80 per share (for the warrants expiring in 2011) and $53.90 per share (for the warrants
expiring in 2013) and are exercisable only on the respective expiration dates. Taken together, the convertible note hedges and warrants are intended to reduce the
potential dilution upon future conversions of the Notes by effectively increasing the initial conversion price to $50.80 per share for the 2011 Notes and $53.90 per
share for the 2013 Notes. The net cost of $143.7 million of the convertible note hedges and warrant transactions was recorded in stockholders’ equity.
Because we have the choice of settling the convertible note hedges and warrants in cash or shares of our stock, and these contracts meet all of the applicable
criteria for equity classification, the cost of the convertible
111Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
note hedges and net proceeds from the sale of the warrants are classified in stockholders’ equity. In addition, because both of these contracts are classified in
stockholders’ equity and are indexed to our own common stock, they are not accounted for as derivatives. We also recorded a deferred tax asset of $148.9 million in
APIC for the effect of the future tax benefits related to the convertible note hedges.
Contemporaneously with the closing of the sale of the Notes, a portion of the net proceeds from the Notes’ issuance and the proceeds of the warrant
transactions were used to repurchase 16.7 million shares of our common stock for $544.9 million under our 2006 stock repurchase program.
The terms of the Notes agreements require us to comply with certain covenants. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all such covenants.
As a result of the CV Therapeutics acquisition, we assumed certain convertible notes from CV Therapeutics (see Note 5). As of December 31, 2009
substantially all of these convertible notes have been extinguished.
Credit Facility
In December 2005, we entered into an agreement with a syndicate of banks for a five year $500.0 million senior credit facility. The $500.0 million facility
consisted of an uncollateralized $300.0 million term loan, which was entered into by Gilead Biopharmaceutics Ireland Corporation (GBIC), one of our wholly-owned
Irish subsidiaries, and an uncollateralized $200.0 million revolving credit facility, which was entered into by the U.S. parent company, Gilead Sciences, Inc. The
proceeds from the term loan were used by GBIC in December 2005 to facilitate a cash dividend distribution of $280.0 million to the U.S. parent company as part of the
repatriation of our qualified foreign earnings under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). During the year ended December 31, 2007, we repaid
$99.0 million, which represented the remaining amounts due under the term loan at which time, the term loan was terminated.
Under the terms of the revolving credit facility entered into in December 2005, interest accrued and was payable at a rate of LIBOR plus a tiered contractual rate
of up to 50 basis points, and was payable quarterly in arrears. The U.S. parent company could prepay any outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest on
the prepaid principal, at any time in whole or in part without penalty or premium. Any outstanding interest or principal at December 2010 would be payable on
demand. The capacity of the revolving credit facility would increase to a maximum of $500.0 million as the term loan was repaid. We had the ability to irrevocably
cancel any unutilized portion of the revolving credit facility, in whole or in part. Any proceeds obtained under the revolving credit facility were expected to be used
for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit up to $25.0 million. One of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries was the guarantor.
In December 2007, we along with GBIC, entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, which superseded the existing revolving credit agreement
above, with a syndicate of banks to increase the credit facility to $1.25 billion. The credit agreement also includes a sub-facility for swing-line loans and letters of
credit. Loans under the credit agreement bear interest at either LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 20 basis points to 32 basis points or the base rate, as described in
the credit agreement. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay loans under the credit agreement in whole or in part without penalty, subject to certain
conditions. The credit agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder shall be due and payable in December 2012. In connection with the credit
agreement, the U.S. parent company entered into an agreement guaranteeing the obligations of GBIC under the credit agreement. In April 2009, in connection with the
acquisition of CV Therapeutics, we borrowed $400.0 million under the credit agreement to partially fund the acquisition. As of December 31, 2009, we have repaid the
$400.0 million under this credit agreement. We expect to use the
112Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
proceeds of any loans under the credit agreement for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2009, we had $4.2 million
letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement. We are required to comply with certain covenants under the credit agreement and as of December 31, 2009,
we were in compliance with all such covenants.
11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Lease Arrangements
We have entered into various long-term non-cancelable operating leases for equipment and facilities. We lease facilities in Foster City, Palo Alto and San
Dimas, California; Durham, North Carolina; Boulder and Westminster, Colorado; Seattle, Washington; the Dublin area of Ireland and the London area of the United
Kingdom. We also have operating leases for sales, marketing and administrative facilities in Europe, Canada and Australia. Our leases expire on various dates
between 2010 and 2029. Our leases in Ireland and the United Kingdom are for 25 and 10 years, respectively, with rent subject to increase on the fifth anniversary of
the respective commencement dates. Many of our facility leases have options to renew. We also have leases for three corporate aircraft, with varying terms, with
renewal options upon expiration of the lease terms.
Lease expense under our operating leases were approximately $37.3 million, $29.3 million and $28.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. Aggregate non-cancelable future minimum rental payments under operating leases are as follows (in thousands):
2010 $ 46,514

Legal Proceedings
On May 12, 2006, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California executed orders dismissing in its entirety and with prejudice the fourth
consolidated amended complaint associated with a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and six current and former executives—our Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer; President and Chief Operating Officer; former Executive Vice President of Operations; Executive Vice President of Research and Development and
Chief Scientific Officer; Senior Vice President of Manufacturing; and Senior Vice President of Research—alleging that the defendants violated federal securities laws,
specifically Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated by the SEC, by making certain alleged false and
misleading statements. The plaintiffs appealed the dismissal. On August 11, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the district
court’s decision and remanded the case to the district court. On February 6, 2009, we filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United
States, requesting that the court review the judgment of the court of appeals. In April 2009, the Supreme Court denied the petition. The case continues before the
district court. On February 13, 2009, we filed a further motion to dismiss the fourth consolidated amended complaint on alternative grounds. On June 3, 2009, the
district court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss and gave plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint. On July 10, 2009, plaintiffs filed a fifth
consolidated amended complaint. We filed a motion to dismiss the fifth consolidated amended complaint, which the district court heard on October 9, 2009. In an
order dated October 13, 2009, the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to
113Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
dismiss. With respect to the Section 10(b) claim, the court denied the motion as to Gilead and two of the six individual defendants; the court granted the motion as to
four of the individual defendants. As to the Section 20(a) claim, the court denied the motion as to all of the individual defendants; therefore, all defendants remain in
the case. On November 16, 2009, we filed an answer to the fifth consolidated amended complaint. The court has scheduled a case management conference for May 14,
2010. It is not possible to predict the outcome of this case, and as such, no amounts have been accrued related to the outcome of this case.
On August 12, 2009, we received a subpoena from the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services requesting
documents regarding the development, marketing and sales of Ranexa. We have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with any related governmental
inquiry. It is not possible to predict the outcome of this inquiry, and as such, no amounts have been accrued related to the outcome of this inquiry.
We are also a party to various other legal actions that arose in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe that any of these other legal actions will
have a material adverse impact on our consolidated business, financial position or results of operations.
Other Commitments
In the normal course of business, we enter into various firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory related
items. As of December 31, 2009, these commitments for the next four years were approximately $820.1 million in 2010, $127.6 million in 2011, $121.5 million in 2012, and
$48.7 million in 2013. The amounts related to active pharmaceutical ingredients only represent minimum purchase requirements. Actual payments for the purchases
related to these active pharmaceutical ingredients were $1.03 billion, $1.04 billion and $548.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.
During 2009, we terminated our prior agreements to purchase three aircraft to be constructed for delivery in 2010 and 2013.
12. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Stock Repurchase Programs
In March 2006, our Board of Directors (Board) authorized a program for the repurchase of our common stock in an amount of up to $1.00 billion over a two-year
period through open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans or privately negotiated purchases or other means, including accelerated
stock repurchase transactions or similar arrangements. In April 2006, we repurchased and retired 16,734,000 shares of our common stock at $32.57 per share for an
aggregate purchase price of $544.9 million. In May and June 2007, we repurchased and retired an aggregate of 11,228,656 shares of our common stock at an average
purchase price of $40.51 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $454.9 million. The 2006 stock repurchase program expired in March 2008.
In October 2007, our Board authorized a new program for the repurchase of our common stock in an amount of up to $3.00 billion through open market and
private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans or privately negotiated purchases or other means, including accelerated stock repurchase transactions or
similar arrangements. This repurchase plan expires in December 2010. In 2007, we repurchased and retired 705,600 shares of our common stock at $46.28 per share for
an aggregate of $32.7 million under the $3.00 billion stock repurchase program.
114Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
In February 2008, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution to repurchase $500.0 million of our common stock on
an accelerated basis. Under the terms of this accelerated share repurchase agreement, we paid $500.0 million to the financial institution to settle the initial purchase
transaction and received 9,373,548 shares of our common stock at a price of $53.34 per share. In June 2008, upon maturity of the agreement and in accordance with the
share delivery provisions of the agreement, we received an additional 239,612 shares of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume weighted-
average prices of our common stock during a specified period less a predetermined discount per share. As a result, the average purchase price of our common stock
from the accelerated share repurchase was $52.01 per share.
We accounted for the accelerated share repurchase as two separate transactions: (a) as shares of common stock acquired in a treasury stock transaction
recorded on the transaction date and (b) as a forward contract indexed to our own common stock. As such, we accounted for the 9,373,548 shares that we received as
a repurchase of our common stock and retired those shares immediately for net income per share purposes. The 239,612 additional shares that we received upon
maturity of the contract in June 2008 were also recorded in stockholders’ equity. We determined that the forward contract indexed to our own common stock met all of
the applicable criteria for equity classification, and therefore, the contract was not accounted for as a derivative.
In October 2008, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution to repurchase $750.0 million of our common stock on an
accelerated basis. Under the terms of the accelerated share repurchase agreement, we paid $750.0 million to settle the initial purchase transaction and received
14,874,519 shares of our common stock at an initial price of $50.42 per share. In March 2009, upon termination of the agreement and in accordance with the share
delivery provisions of the agreement, we received an additional 1,356,337 shares of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume weighted-average
prices of our common stock during a specified period less a predetermined discount per share. As a result, the total number of shares repurchased and retired under
this accelerated share repurchase agreement was 16,230,856 shares at an average purchase price of $46.21 per share. The accounting for this accelerated share
repurchase was consistent with that of our previous accelerated share repurchase.
In 2008, in addition to the common stock repurchased under the two accelerated share repurchase transactions, we repurchased and retired 14,696,449 shares
of our common stock at an average purchase price of $48.94 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $719.3 million through open market transactions.
In 2009, in addition to the additional shares that we received under the accelerated share repurchase agreement completed in March 2009, we repurchased and
retired 21,845,929 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $45.69 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $998.1 million through open market
transactions. As of December 31, 2009, we completed share repurchases under our $3.00 billion stock repurchase program.
We use the par value method of accounting for our stock repurchases. Under the par value method, common stock is first charged with the par value of the
shares involved. The excess of the cost of shares acquired over the par value is allocated to APIC based on an estimated average sales price per issued share with
the excess amounts charged to retained earnings. As a result of our stock repurchases in 2007, we reduced common stock and APIC by an aggregate of $26.9 million
and charged $460.8 million to retained earnings. As a result of our stock repurchases in 2008, we reduced common stock and APIC by an aggregate of $95.8 million
and charged $1.88 billion to retained earnings. As a result of our stock repurchases in 2009, we reduced common stock and APIC by an aggregate of $61.7 million and
charged $940.8 million to retained earnings.
In January 2010, our Board authorized a new program for the repurchase of our common stock in an amount of up to $1.00 billion through open market and
private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans or
115Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
privately negotiated purchases or other means, including accelerated stock repurchase transactions or similar arrangements. This repurchase plan expires in January
2011.
Preferred Stock
We have 5,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock issuable in series. Our Board is authorized to determine the designation, powers, preferences and rights
of any such series. We have designated 800,000 shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for potential issuance under our November 1994 rights
agreement with BNY Mellon Investor Services, LLC (formerly known as ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, LLC), as amended (the Rights Plan). There was no
preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.
Rights Plan
The Rights Plan provides for the distribution of a preferred stock purchase right as a dividend for each share of our common stock. The purchase rights are not
currently exercisable. Under certain conditions involving an acquisition or proposed acquisition by any person or group of 15% or more of our common stock, the
purchase rights permit the holders (other than the 15% holder) to purchase our common stock at a 50% discount from the market price at that time, upon payment of a
specified exercise price per purchase right. In addition, in the event of certain business combinations, the purchase rights permit the purchase of the common stock of
an acquirer at a 50% discount from the market price at that time. Under certain conditions, the purchase rights may be redeemed by the Board in whole, but not in part,
at a price of $0.0025 per purchase right. The purchase rights have no voting privileges and are attached to and automatically trade with our common stock.
In October 1999, October 2003 and May 2006, the Board approved amendments to the Rights Plan. The first amendment provided, among other things, for an
increase in the exercise price of a right under the plan from $15 to $100 and an extension of the term of the plan from November 2004 to October 2009. The second
amendment provides, among other things, for an increase in the exercise price of a right under the plan from $100 to $400 and an extension of the term of the Rights
Plan to October 2013. The third amendment was a clarifying amendment entered into in connection with an increase in the designated number of shares of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock for potential issuance under the Rights Plan in May 2006.
Stock Option Plans
In May 2004, our stockholders approved and we adopted the Gilead Sciences, Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan). Stock options under the NeXstar
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NeXstar), Triangle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Triangle), Corus, Myogen and CV Therapeutics stock option plans, which we assumed as a result of
the acquisitions of NeXstar, Triangle, Corus, Myogen and CV Therapeutics have been converted into options to purchase our common stock effective with the
closing of the respective acquisitions. The 2004 Plan is a broad based incentive plan that allows for awards to be granted to our employees, directors and
consultants. The 2004 Plan provides for option grants designated as either non-qualified or incentive stock options. Prior to January 1, 2006, we granted both non-
qualified and incentive stock options, but all stock options granted after January 1, 2006 have been non-qualified stock options. Under the 2004 Plan, employee stock
options generally vest over five years, are exercisable over a period not to exceed the contractual term of ten years from the date the stock options are issued and are
granted at prices not less than the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. Stock option exercises are settled with common stock from the 2004 Plan’s
previously authorized and available pool of shares. In May 2009, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2004 Plan to increase the number of shares
authorized for issuance under the plan by 20,000,000 shares of our common stock.

In connection with the acquisition of CV Therapeutics, we assumed CV Therapeutics’ 1994 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, Non-Employee
Directors’ Stock Option Plan, as amended and restated, 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, 2000 Nonstatutory Incentive Plan, as amended and
restated, and 2004 Employee Commencement Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (collectively, the CV Therapeutics Plans). The majority of options that were
issued and outstanding under the CV Therapeutics Plans as of April 15, 2009 were converted into options to purchase approximately 1.8 million shares of our
common stock and remain subject to their original terms and conditions. There are no shares available for future grant under the CV Therapeutics Plans.
As of December 31, 2009, a total of 121,594,183 shares of common stock have been authorized for grant and 56,075,208 shares remain available for future grant
under the 2004 Plan.
The following table summarizes activity under our stock option plans. All option grants presented in the table had exercise prices not less than the fair value of

Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Awards
In January 2007, we granted 369,680 performance-based share awards (the 2007 performance shares) under the 2004 Plan. These awards were divided into three
tranches for both vesting and performance measurement purposes. Subject to our achievement of specified market and performance goals relative to a pre-determined
peer group, these awards will vest over a three-year period. The actual number of shares of our common stock that we will ultimately issue will be calculated by
multiplying the number of performance shares by a payout percentage ranging from 0% to 200%. Performance shares will vest only when a committee (or
subcommittee) of our Board has determined that we have achieved our specified market and performance goals. The fair value of the 2007 performance shares is
estimated at grant date using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology. Stock-based compensation expenses for these performance shares is recognized over the
requisite service periods using a straight-line expense attribution approach reduced for forfeitures. The weighted-average grant date fair value of the 2007
performance shares was $34.80 per share.
In January 2008 and 2009, we granted 219,690 and 426,305 performance-based share awards (the 2008 performance shares and the 2009 performance shares,
respectively) with terms substantially similar to the 2007 performance shares, except that there was a single three-year performance measurement and vesting period
for each of the 2008 performance shares and 2009 performance shares. The weighted-average grant date fair value of the 2008 performance shares and 2009
performance shares was $56.61 and $61.89 per share, respectively, for the 2008 and 2009 performance shares.
We recognized $14.9 million, $7.5 million and $7.8 million of stock-based compensation expenses in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, relating to these
performance shares.
During 2009 we granted 1,259,808 time-based restricted stock awards to employees under the 2004 Plan. These awards vest annually over a five-year period.
We recognized $6.5 million of stock-based compensation expenses in 2009 relating to these time-based awards.
We have also granted performance-based restricted stock awards to certain of our employees under the 2004 Plan. The vesting of these awards is subject to
the achievement of specified performance goals. The number of these awards issued to date has not been significant.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (ESPP), employees can purchase shares of our common stock based on a percentage of their
compensation subject to certain limits. The purchase price per share is equal to the lower of 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the offering date or
the purchase date. The ESPP offers a two-year look-back feature as well as an automatic reset feature that provides for an offering period to be reset to a new lower-
priced offering if the offering price of the new offering period is less than that of the current offering period. ESPP purchases are settled with common stock from the
ESPP’s previously authorized and available pool of shares. During 2009, 932,447 shares were issued under the ESPP for $34.9 million. A total of 33,280,000 shares of
common stock have been reserved for issuance under the ESPP, and there were 7,677,896 shares available for issuance under the ESPP as of December 31, 2009.
As of December 31, 2009, there was $15.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the ESPP, which is expected to be recognized over an estimated
weighted-average period of 1.0 years.

13. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expenses included in our Consolidated Statements of Income (in thousands):
Year Ended December 31,
2009 2008 2007
Cost of goods sold $ 10,859 $ 10,312 $ 11,224
Research and development expenses 82,893 66,523 72,082
Selling, general and administrative expenses 92,006 76,529 101,299
Stock-based compensation expense included in total costs and expenses 185,758 153,364 184,605
Income tax effect (46,486) (40,565) (53,261)
Stock-based compensation expense included in net income $ 139,272 $ 112,799 $ 131,344
During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we capitalized $11.4 million, $9.9 million and $9.8 million of stock-based compensation costs to
inventory, respectively.
Stock-based compensation is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income using a graded vesting
expense attribution approach for non-vested stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, and using the straight-line expense attribution approach for stock
options granted after our adoption of new guidance for share-based payments to employees and directors on January 1, 2006. As stock-based compensation
expenses related to stock options recognized on adoption of the new guidance is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, gross expense has been reduced for
estimated forfeitures. The guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
from those estimates. We estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience. Prior to the adoption of this guidance, pro forma information that was required to
be disclosed included forfeitures as they occurred. As a result of the guidance adopted on January 1, 2006, we only recognize a tax benefit from stock-based
compensation in APIC if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to
account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the Consolidated
Statements of Income rather than through APIC.

Valuation Assumptions
Fair values of awards granted under our stock option plans and ESPP were estimated at grant or purchase dates using a Black-Scholes option valuation model.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and expected award life.
We used the following assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of the awards:
Year Ended December 31,
2009 2008 2007
Expected volatility:
Stock options 35% 34% 34%
ESPP 37% 31% 30%
Expected term in years:
Stock options 5.3 5.3 5.0
ESPP 1.3 1.2 1.2
Risk-free interest rate:
Stock options 2.1% 2.8% 4.6%
ESPP 0.7% 2.1% 4.7%
Expected dividend yield 0% 0% 0%
The fair value of stock options granted was calculated using the single option approach. We use a blend of historical volatility along with implied volatility for
traded options on our common stock to determine our expected volatility. The expected term of stock-based awards represents the weighted-average period the
awards are expected to remain outstanding. We estimate the weighted-average expected term based on historical cancellation and historical exercise data related to
our stock options as well as the contractual term and vesting terms of the awards. The risk-free interest rate is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the
term of the stock-based awards. The dividend yield is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts.
14. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)
Comprehensive income (loss) comprises net income and certain changes in stockholders’ equity that are excluded from net income, such as changes in the fair
value of our outstanding effective cash flow hedges, changes in unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale securities and changes in our cumulative
foreign currency translation account. Comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 is included in our Consolidated Statements
of Stockholders’ Equity. The components of comprehensive income (loss) are shown net of related taxes where the underlying assets or liabilities are held in
jurisdictions that are expected to generate a future tax benefit or liability.

The valuation allowance increased (decreased) by $1.1 million, $(23.5) million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. In April 2009, through the acquisition of CV Therapeutics, we established a valuation allowance of $15.1 million against the deferred tax asset related to
California and other state net operating loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2009, upon integration of CV Therapeutics, we have concluded that it is more likely
than not that we will realize the benefit from the deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards, and therefore, we released the related
valuation allowance resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately $14.0 million.
At December 31, 2009, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $923.9 million. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will
start to expire in 2010, if not utilized. We also had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately $24.9 million which will start to expire in 2010, if not utilized. In
addition, we had state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.01 billion and $6.3 million, respectively. The state net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards will start to expire in 2013 and 2017, respectively, if not utilized.
Utilization of net operating losses and tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided in the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. This annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating losses (NOLs) and credits before
utilization.
We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of
limitations is open for 2003 and onward. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their NOLs
and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations remains open for all years.

Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for
the 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result,
significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax
jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions.
As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had total federal, state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of $93.3 million and $119.3 million, respectively, including
interest of $5.4 million and $10.1 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $74.7 million and $111.1 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition. We have continued to classify interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
In 2009, we reached agreement with the IRS on several issues related to the examinations of our federal income tax returns for 2003 through 2007. We also
amended our California income tax returns for 2003 through 2007 based on the resolution of certain tax positions with the IRS. As a result, we reduced our
unrecognized tax benefits by $76.2 million in 2009.
As of December 31, 2009, we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $5.0 million in the next 12
months as we expect to have clarification from the IRS and other tax authorities around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining
unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities.
The following is a rollforward of our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (in thousands):

17. DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS
We maintain a retirement savings plan under which eligible employees may defer compensation for income tax purposes under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code (Gilead Plan). Under the Gilead Plan, employees may contribute up to 60% of their eligible annual compensation, subject to IRS plan limits. We make
matching contributions under the Gilead Plan. In 2009 and 2008, we contributed up to 50% of an employee’s contributions up to an annual maximum match of $5,000.
In 2007, we contributed up to 50% of an employee’s first 6% of contributions up to an annual maximum match of $3,500. Our total matching contribution expense

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
under the Gilead Plan for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $10.2 million, $7.8 million and $4.5 million, respectively.
We maintain a deferred compensation plan under which our directors and key employees may defer compensation for income tax purposes. The deferred
compensation plan is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan which is not subject to the qualification requirements under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code. Compensation deferred after December 31, 2004 is subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan, officers and other
senior grade level employees may contribute up to 70% of their annual salaries and up to 100% of their annual bonus while directors may contribute up to 100% of
their annual retainer fee. Amounts deferred by participants are deposited with a rabbi trust and are recorded in other noncurrent assets in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Beginning in 2004, directors may also elect to receive all or a portion of their annual cash retainer in phantom shares, which gives the participant the right to
receive an amount equal to the value of a specified number of shares over a specified period of time and which will be payable in shares of our common stock (with
fractional shares paid out in cash) as established by the plan administrator. As of December 31, 2009, we had 25,795 phantom shares outstanding. Participants can
elect one of several distribution dates available under the plan at which they will receive their deferred compensation payment.
18. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In January 2010, our Board authorized a new program for the repurchase of our common stock in an amount of up to $1.00 billion through open market and
private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans or privately negotiated purchases or other means, including accelerated stock repurchase transactions or
similar arrangements. This repurchase plan expires in January 2011.
In February 2010, we received marketing approval from the FDA for Cayston as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in CF patients with P.
aeruginosa.

(1) In the second quarter of 2008, we recognized a $10.9 million charge for purchased IPR&D associated with our acquisition of all of the assets of Navitas related
to its cicletanine business.
(2) On January 1, 2009, we adopted guidance for our 2011 Notes and our 2013 Notes on a retrospective basis. The guidance required us to bifurcate the
conversion option from the debt instrument by classifying the conversion option in equity and then accreting the resulting discount on the debt as additional
interest expense over the expected life of the debt. See Note 1.
On January 1, 2009, we adopted guidance for our joint ventures with BMS on a retrospective basis. As a result of adopting this guidance, we presented the
noncontrolling interest on our Consolidated Statements of Income as net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, a component of consolidated net income,
on a retrospective basis. See Note 1.

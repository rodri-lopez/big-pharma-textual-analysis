To All Stakeholders:
Thank you for your interest in Gilead and our ESG commitments.
We hope that our inaugural ESG report is an informative resource
as part of our ongoing dialogue and engagement with you.
Since its inception in 1987, Gilead has operated with Environmental,
Social and Governance principles as an integral part of its business.
While the term “ESG” is relatively new, Gilead’s business practices
over 35 years have always reflected ESG themes in our mission to
create a healthier world for all people. We have continued to evolve
our approach to ESG over time and today we think about it across
three core pillars:
Innovating for Unmet Needs
Empowering People and Communities
Sustaining Our Shared Planet
These pillars, along with a robust governance structure and
commitment to the highest standards of ethical conduct, enable
Gilead to deliver shareholder value in a sustainable and
responsible manner.

ABOUT GILEAD:
CREATING POSSIBLE®
Years ago, I told the doctor who was treating
a loved one that I wished I had studied medicine
so I could help people like he did. His response,
‘You work for a biopharma company. I wish I
could help more than one person at a time, like
you.’ That comment has motivated me ever since.
My job may be manufacturing, but my purpose
is supporting Gilead’s vision to create a healthier

ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL GOVERNANCE
(ESG) AT GILEAD
Gilead’s approach to ESG stems from its unique role within the healthcare industry. Since 1987, Gilead
has developed groundbreaking therapies to meet the needs of underserved individuals at risk of or
living with HIV, viral hepatitis and cancer. Through decades of serving these patient communities,
Gilead has demonstrated our commitment to ESG by advancing health equity for all. And, we will
continue to advance health prosperity for decades to come.
Our ESG strategy is designed to integrate with and drive progress toward achieving our corporate
ambitions. Our commitment to ESG topics plays a critical role in helping us achieve our mission in
a way that is socially responsible and environmentally sustainable.
Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our ESG strategy, and we report ESG progress and
setbacks regularly. We have a structured Corporate Responsibility Committee that meets quarterly and
a working group with other subcommittees charged with operationalizing our ESG strategy and vision.
We completed a materiality assessment in 2020 and have since developed goals and strategies
addressing our most significant topics. These complement our compendium of existing programs
and investments aimed at advancing health equity and being the employer and partner of choice.

Medical Affairs
At Gilead, making the world a healthier place for all people starts
with delivering innovative therapies. Our ambitions have led to a
cure for hepatitis C, and we are leading the charge to help end the
HIV epidemic for everyone, everywhere, by helping to transform
treatment and prevention of HIV. We work to provide patients with
world-class science, including new antiviral therapies, next-generation
cancer treatments and medicines for inflammatory diseases. Our
work in cell therapy has led to transformational outcomes for patients
with lymphomas and other B-cell malignancies.
Innovative science, however, is just the start. Gilead has long been
committed to addressing the social determinants of health and
overcoming barriers to care. Through our many global and local
partnerships, we strive to advance health equity, diversity in clinical
trials and access to medicines to reduce disparities, advance
education among healthcare professionals and support the local
communities in which we operate.
These are just some of the efforts that place Gilead at the forefront
of tackling the world’s greatest public health challenges.

Benefiting Underserved Populations
The burden of disease disproportionately impacts some communities
and populations due to social determinants of health, disparities in
healthcare access, comorbidities and differences in disease biology.
At Gilead, we have pioneered therapies and dosing options that can
make a dramatic difference in the lives of these individuals through
prevention, treatment and, in some cases, even cure.

Transforming HIV Prevention and Treatment
Gilead has helped transform HIV from an often fatal disease to one
that can be treated and prevented. Working in close partnership with
the HIV community, we’ve pioneered innovations that were once
thought impossible – from the first single tablet treatment regimen
to the first oral therapy to prevent HIV infection.
Today, we’re addressing the diverse needs of people impacted
by HIV by researching long-acting treatment and investigational
prevention options. We are evaluating our first-in-class therapy,
lenacapavir, as a potential backbone for these options. Meanwhile,
we continue to work with speed and commitment toward a cure.

LEADING INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY IN CLINICAL RESEARCH
Inclusion is a core value at Gilead, and nowhere is this more important than in the design and execution
of our clinical trials. We have seen that when clinical trial programming incorporates the specific expertise
and perspectives of historically underrepresented communities, it drives more accurate outcomes for our
patients. We want to ensure that the voices and participation of Black, Hispanic or Latino people, people
of color, women and LGBTQ+ individuals are shaping our clinical research. This includes the patients
enrolled in our studies, as well as the investigators who lead them.
Accordingly, Gilead has committed $14 million, over four years, to the Robert A. Winn Diversity in
Clinical Trials Award program to help to transform the clinical trial landscape, advancing and
institutionalizing the trial diversity Gilead has helped pioneer.
We have also made it easier for historically underrepresented groups to access our clinical trials
by locating these studies in or closer to their communities.
With this understanding, we have embedded greater Inclusion and Diversity into the design of our
clinical trials.
My team helps ensure that clinical trials are available to everyone,
including racial and ethnic minorities who have historically been
underrepresented in these studies, because at Gilead we believe
that every patient should have access to innovative therapies.

BOLSTERING THE PEDIATRIC
Dublin, Ireland
RESEARCH PIPELINE
When it comes to research and treatment for children with serious
diseases, there continues to be a great need for scientific innovation
and access. Studying pharmaceuticals for children presents unique
challenges, including adapting research protocols to different
developmental stages and recruiting a large enough number of
children for trials. And because the market for pediatric therapies is
smaller than for adults – especially for rare diseases – this research
is not always financially viable for pharmaceutical companies.
Recognizing the need to adapt innovative new therapies for
children, irrespective of the business case, Gilead launched a
new Pediatric Center of Excellence in Dublin, Ireland. The center
conducts pediatric clinical trials across multiple countries for
treatments addressing HIV, HBV and COVID-19. This new center
could play a critical role in addressing unmet needs for children,
such as new formulations with appropriate dosing, new options
if treatments are not available or no longer work and access to
clinical trials.

INEQUITIES IN METASTATIC TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER
In 2021, the FDA approved Gilead’s Trodelvy as the first antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) shown to improve survival for patients living with
metatastic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). Historically, women with TNBC have had very few effective treatment options and faced
a poor prognosis.
TNBC disproportionately impacts Black women, a population severely underrepresented in cancer research. According to a 2021 report led
by researchers from Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Black women have nearly three times the risk of TNBC as
compared to their white counterparts. Moreover, Black women who are diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer are 28% more likely to die
from the disease than white women with the same diagnosis, based on findings from a study published in 2021 in the journal JAMA Oncology.
The reasons for these outcomes are only partially understood, but this disproportionate impact appears to be due, at least in part, to historic
mistrust of the healthcare system and other social determinants of health that increase both incidence rates and delays in diagnosis and
treatment. Gilead is committed to advancing health equity for Black women affected by TNBC, and in 2022, awarded $5.7 million in grants
to 21 U.S. organizations for programs addressing gaps across the cancer care continuum including:
Addressing the role of social determinants of health in accessing screening, diagnosis and cancer care
Creating sustainable solutions to promoting racial equity in breast cancer care
Improving community, patient and provider communication
Providing outreach and education about TNBC for patients, families and caregivers

ONCOLOGY GRANT™
Due to social, environmental and economic disparities,
historically neglected and underrepresented communities
are at increased risk of developing or dying from breast cancer.
Toward Health Equity Oncology Grant was created to address
these health inequities.
In 2023, Gilead awarded $7.6 million in grants to 24 U.S.-based
organizations addressing barriers to breast cancer care. These
evidence-based programs focus on patient navigation and
digital/mobile interventions such as patient navigator training,
cultural competency training and services combating barriers,
such as transportation.
The 2023 grantees were chosen by Gilead based on several
criteria including their ability to create measurable and
sustainable change toward health equity. The new grantees
serve historically neglected and underrepresented communities
including Hispanic, Jewish, LGBTQ+, Indigenous American
and others, and will work to address access disparities in the
treatment of breast cancer.

SUPPORTING THE PATIENT JOURNEY WITH CAR T-CELL TREATMENT
To support patient access to innovative CAR T-cell therapy, Kite is working with country health authorities, hospitals, patient and professional
groups to ease care delivery, navigation and reduce time to access for patients. CAR T-cell therapy is only available at Authorized Treatment
Centers (ATCs), known as Qualified Treatment Centers (QTCs) outside the U.S., that have gone through training and certification to administer
cell therapy. Many patients need to travel to reach an ATC/QTC and stay nearby for significant periods of time, which creates financial and
logistical barriers to care. For patients who have been prescribed CAR T-cell therapy treatment and meet financial criteria, Kite helps provide
support such as transportation and housing assistance. Kite may help provide support such as grants to patient associations’ support programs
that help patients with their initial travel to centers for CAR T-cell therapy evaluation.
There are currently more than 350 ATCs/QTCs globally, with 120+ in the U.S. Gilead and Kite have invested in increasing the number
of ATCs/QTCs to help more patients access cell therapy treatment at locations closer to their homes.

addresses new HIV infections and deaths from AIDS-related illnesses in EECA through action, investment and resourcing to improve the quality
of prevention and care for people at risk of or living with HIV in the region.
And, when crises emerge, Gilead consistently responds in situations where we can make meaningful impact. For example, Ukraine bears the
second-highest number of HIV cases in EECA, according to UNAIDS. In 2022, in addition to the ongoing work of RADIAN inside the country,
we collaborated to address the needs of Ukrainian refugees living with HIV who fled to neighboring countries including Czechia, Moldova,
Poland and Romania.
Among the offerings are the RADIAN Model Cities program and the Unmet Need fund. The Model Cities program provides funding that
supports innovative approaches to prevention and care that reduce the number of new HIV infections, improve the wellbeing of people living
with HIV, help reduce the stigma and build on programs that provide HIV services. The Unmet Need fund supports local initiatives across the
EECA region beyond the select Model Cities with a focus on prevention and care, education, community empowerment and novel partnerships.

VOLUNTARY LICENSING AGREEMENTS EXPAND ACCESS TO COVID-19 TREATMENTS
A voluntary license in the pharmaceutical industry is an authorization given by a patent holder, like Gilead, to a generic company, allowing
the generic company to produce a medicine. The aim is to broaden access to the treatment and make it more accessible for people in
developing countries.
Gilead has signed non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements with nine generic pharmaceutical manufacturers to expand the supply of
remdesivir (which we sell under the brand name Veklury), our COVID-19 treatment. Veklury and generic remdesivir have been made available
to more than 13 million patients around the world, including nearly 8 million people in low- and lower-middle-income countries through our
voluntary licensing program. This represents 65% of total remdesivir access. As part of our commitment to enable broad patient access to
remdesivir, the agreements allow licensees a right to set their own prices and receive a technology transfer from Gilead to help them scale
up production quickly.

IMPROVING ACCESS TO VIRAL HEPATITIS CARE IN VIETNAM AND THE PHILIPPINES
Gilead is part of a four-year public-private academic institution collaboration initiative with the Partnership
for Health Advancement in Vietnam (HAIVN), a collaboration between Brigham and Women’s Hospital,
Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. This first-of-its-kind, multiyear initiative
will help address barriers that limit viral hepatitis diagnosis and care at primary healthcare facilities in
these two countries with high burdens of HBV and HCV. In Vietnam, nearly 7.8 million people have HBV
and 900,000 have HCV, and in the Philippines, over 10 million people have HBV and 450,000 have HCV.
Gilead and HAIVN will work together with a multistakeholder coalition, involving national ministries of
health, academic stakeholders such as the University of the Philippines Manila, provincial hospitals and
primary healthcare centers. The coalition will support this program and generate evidence to support
a shift from a resource challenged specialist approach to a primary healthcare model.
The pharmaceutical industry and academia have strong collaborations in drug discovery, however, the
resulting innovations have not reached everyone who could benefit. This cooperation centers on last mile
delivery, a unique partnership focused on service delivery innovation such that together we can reach all
people who could benefit from better viral hepatitis care.

INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY
Mission Critical
Inclusion is a principle that permeates every aspect of our business. It is essential to enabling our
purpose to create a healthier world. Our long-standing efforts to foster an inclusive culture and diverse
workforce are already paying dividends at Gilead. And, based on a 2022 pulse survey measuring
workforce perceptions of equal opportunity at Gilead, employees are acknowledging our progress.
Relative to many of our peers in the pharmaceutical/biopharmaceutical sector, Gilead’s employee
base is quite diverse. And while we are always aspiring to do better, as evidenced by our five-year
representation goals, we feel we’ve made significant strides. In U.S., for example, more than half
of our workforce is women, and more than 60% identify as ethnically diverse. A majority of our Gilead
Leadership Team identify as ethnically or racially diverse, and a majority are women. Similarly, nearly
half our Board of Directors identify as ethnically or racially diverse, and a third are women.
This diversity from the top and throughout our organization is a driver for innovation and reflection
of our Core Values. Gilead’s overall inclusion and diversity aspirations are:
Be the employer of choice for diverse talent.
Foster an inclusive culture where differences are leveraged to innovate and enable our mission.
Be respected for equitable and socially responsible practices.

Global Inclusion and Diversity Council
In 2020, Gilead established a multipronged Inclusion and Diversity Council to draw perspectives from
every level of the organization and develop a strategy that truly embeds inclusion and diversity across the

further our culture of inclusion. The council includes members of the Gilead Leadership Team, employee

Defining Inclusion and Diversity at Gilead
At Gilead, our Inclusion and Diversity work intersects with every aspect of our business because we
understand that our differences are among our greatest sources of strengths. These include visible
and non-visible attributes, such as race, gender, gender identity, age, ethnicity, people with disabilities,
appearance, thinking styles, beliefs, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation and education,
among others. While our Inclusion and Diversity team is dedicated to strategizing and implementing
company initiatives, every employee plays a role in creating and fostering a work environment where
our differences are valued, and people feel involved, respected and connected.

TAKING HEALTH EQUITY ON THE ROAD
Education is among the most powerful tools for advancing health
equity. In 2022, Gilead staged an education equity roadshow at
11 historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs).
The roadshow focused on addressing the social determinants
of health, providing support and resources to help Black students
navigate career opportunities, and offering education and
awareness on sexual health and breast cancer. The roadshow
visited nine cities and included five unique campus activations:
“Classroom takeover” recruitment sessions with
Gilead executives.
Career-focused “lunch and learn” sessions.
Pop-up events for students to learn about Gilead’s
health equity initiatives.
Gilead oncology experts to drive awareness and
education of breast cancer.
Community liaisons educating students on sexual health.

Advancing sustainability within and beyond Gilead
gives me deep satisfaction, because my personal
passions and professional commitments are wholly
aligned. As a company, we’ve made big strides

SUSTAINING OUR SHARED PLANET
The health of our planet and its people are inextricably linked.
Climate change and poor air quality resulting from burning fossil
fuels can adversely impact human health. Given Gilead’s vision
to make the world a healthier place for all people, we feel an
obligation to be part of the solution. Our strategy is to set ambitious
environmental targets and put programs in place to address
the four focus areas that guide our comprehensive approach to
sustainability: Carbon, Water, Waste and Product.
We have set bold science-based greenhouse gas emissions
reduction targets for our own operations and for our value chain.
And we’re engaging with suppliers to achieve them. We’re taking
measures to reduce our energy and water use, drive waste and
inefficiencies from our manufacturing processes and operations,
and to embrace green buildings.
Gilead’s efforts also reach beyond the impacts associated with
our company. We are collaborating with universities, industry
associations, local communities and others to advance sustainability.
Our aim is to embed sustainability into our culture so that it is
integral to everything we do. If we do this well, we will be successful
in our mission to deliver innovative medicines while doing what is

SETTING AMBITIOUS
SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS
To realize our vision of a low-carbon future, hold ourselves
accountable and track our progress along the way, we set
ambitious science-based emissions reduction targets in 2021
for our own operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2) and for our supply
chain (Scope 3). After a comprehensive review process, we
received validation for these targets from the Science Based
Targets initiative (SBTi). With our SBTi-validated goals, we have
taken our place alongside leading companies in the fight against
climate change. We have also committed to transitioning our
operations in line with a net-zero pathway by 2030, reducing
Scope 1 and 2 emissions where technologically and financially
feasible and addressing residual emissions.
Beyond emissions goals, we have set a range of targets across
our four sustainability focus areas. Due to the collection and
reporting cycles for our environmental data, we will be reporting
2022 progress against these goals on our website in Q3 2023
and in our next ESG report.

ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION
Making Good on Our Commitments
With new targets set in 2021, our efforts in 2022 centered on a
range of new and ongoing initiatives across our four sustainability
focus areas through a concerted, company wide effort.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
Using energy more efficiently is an important tool for reducing our
carbon footprint and delivering business benefits, including cost
savings. In 2022, we completed energy and water assessments
across the enterprise and acted upon the results by implementing a
variety of efficiency initiatives around the world. We focused primarily
on optimizing our HVAC systems, our largest source of electricity
and natural gas consumption. We’ve already begun to reap the
benefits with an annualized savings/avoidance of 17.9 million kWh.
This is enough to power nearly 1,700 single-family homes, based on
information from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

RENEWABLE ENERGY
In support of our greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals, Gilead
has taken steps to source more of its power from renewable sources.
We’re members of two initiatives created by the Climate Group,
a nonprofit organization working with businesses and governments
globally to address climate change. Our membership in the
organization’s RE100 initiative means that Gilead has committed to –
and is currently working toward – obtaining all the electricity used in
our operations from renewable sources by 2025. As part of Climate
Group’s EV100 initiative, we are transitioning our owned and leased
fleets to electric vehicles (EV) and installing EV charging infrastructure.
Going into 2022, four solar installations at Gilead’s owned facilities
had the capacity to generate up to 9.5 million kWh per year of
renewable energy. In 2022, we incorporated an additional solar
array into our operations at our Cork, Ireland, manufacturing facility
that will generate 584 MWh of electricity annually and avoid 248
metric tons in greenhouse gas emissions. At Gilead’s Brasília, Brazil,
facility, we replaced a traditional electric water heater with one that
is solar powered. In addition to lowering the facility’s greenhouse
gas emissions, the cost of the equipment and installation is projected
to be recovered in energy cost savings in less than three years.

ELECTRIC AND LOW-EMISSIONS VEHICLES
Worldwide, Gilead has a fleet of approximately 3,130 vehicles, offering a significant opportunity to reduce
our emissions footprint by transitioning to electric and other low-emissions vehicles. We have set a goal
to have this transition complete by 2030, where technically and economically feasible.
In 2022, we kicked off this initiative in earnest. As part of an initial EV100 pilot program, we will replace
approximately 10% of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles with pure EVs to be deployed in the U.S.
by the second half of 2023. To support this investment and our long-term goal, we are also working to
increase the EV charging station infrastructure at all facilities to accommodate our electrified fleet.

GREEN BUILDINGS
The ongoing expansion of Gilead office, lab and manufacturing facilities around the world, coupled with Gilead’s responsible growth
strategy, enables us to deliver on the goal to simultaneously reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. This is achieved, in part, by designing,
constructing and operating the facilities that meet high levels of sustainability performance. In the past seven years, the number of facilities
with green-building certifications achieved by Gilead has increased from zero to 20, with 18 projects certified in the last three years.
In 2022, three more Gilead facilities received Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. Through sustainable
design, construction and operations, buildings with LEED certification are designed to have lower carbon, energy, water and waste
footprints; prioritize safer and more locally sourced materials; and deliver lower exposure to toxins than equivalent standard buildings.

WATER CONSERVATION
Developing and manufacturing pharmaceutical products requires a
significant amount of water. Gilead’s approach is to first reduce the
amount of water we use in facilities that have high consumption and
then pursue ways to recycle and reuse it. In relation to our water
consumption that takes place in water-stressed regions, we have
set a target to achieve water neutrality by 2030. Water neutrality
entails reducing our water usage as much as possible and investing
in projects that increase supplies of fresh water to offset the water
that we must use.
In 2022, our Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, facility completed a
wastewater diversion project that has reduced our consumption
of clean city water by 2,555 cubic meters per year, representing a
4.4% reduction in our potable water withdrawal. The project entails
reusing water rejected from our high purity water system to the
cooling tower systems at a process manufacturing facility.
The grounds at our headquarters campus in
Foster City are maintained with a xeriscaping
plan – landscaping designed to require little
to no irrigation. In 2022, we converted almost
2.2 acres of turf landscape to xeriscape, which
will help decrease the amount of potable

WASTE REDUCTION AND DIVERSION FROM LANDFILL
Gilead is targeting significant waste reduction in our manufacturing
and operations. In 2022, we identified a baseline against which to
set new waste and single-use plastics reduction targets.
In 2022, 47% of the targeted single-use plastics were eliminated
from Gilead sites (excluding manufacturing and R&D operations) to
support our commitment to achieve 100% elimination of targeted
single-use plastics by 2025. Currently, we are working to replace all
compostable plastic cups, food containers, utensils and other items
with reusable and compostable, fiber-based options.
We are also exploring ways to reduce the amount of single-use
plastics used to contain and ship our pharmaceutical products. This
is particularly challenging in the pharmaceutical/biopharmaceutical
industry, as single-use plastics help product quality demands and
reduce the risk of contamination. Also, we aim to replace secondary
and tertiary plastic packaging used to package our products with
equivalents that are widely recyclable or reusable and, where
possible, to eliminate unnecessary plastics altogether. We will
continue to innovate to help address the growing global issue of
plastics pollution.

SUSTAINABLE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
Gilead is committed to making the research and development of our pharmaceuticals as sustainable
as possible. Laboratories have traditionally been resource-intensive environments. To ensure that our
labs are as environmentally sustainable as possible, Gilead has partnered with the nonprofit group My
Green Lab®. This organization, run by scientists, for scientists, seeks to fundamentally and permanently
improve the sustainability of scientific research. Gilead has five labs that have successfully completed
the rigorous My Green Lab sustainability certification program. Four research and development
laboratories received the following certifications in 2022:
BIOMARKER SCIENCES, FOSTER CITY, CA: Green Level (highest level)
ANALYTICAL OPERATIONS, FOSTER CITY, CA: Gold Level
BIOLOGY, SEATTLE, WA: Gold Level
MEDICAL CHEMISTRY, SEATTLE, WA: Gold Level
Gilead is also dedicated to ensuring its individual products are made in ways that are less resource-
intensive and safer for the environment. One example of this approach is with Gilead’s drug, Trodelvy.
Producing this treatment requires the use of chromatography, a process for separating components
of a mixture. Gilead has enhanced the manufacturing process and in doing so, has reduced the usage
of silicates and solvents significantly, thereby reducing our environment footprint.

GILEAD PARK AND AMPHITHEATER
In 2022, Gilead completed work on an on-campus park and outdoor event space at our Foster City headquarters based on principles from
The Sustainable SITES Initiative. SITES includes a rating system that guides, evaluates and certifies a project’s sustainability in the planning,
design, construction and management of landscapes and other outdoor spaces. The Gilead Park achieved a GOLD rating from SITES in
2023. It is the largest certified SITES project and the first SITES v2 Gold project in the San Francisco Bay Area. In addition, Gilead is the
first pharmaceutical/biotech company to achieve SITES v2 certification.
This new addition provides employees access to nature during breaks, a sense of wellbeing with opportunities for active and passive
recreation and a beautiful place for gatherings and special events. The amphitheater features some innovative sustainability benefits,
and the park is a model for protecting biodiversity.
A SHOWCASE FOR BIODIVERSITY
Gilead recognizes the importance of protecting and preserving natural areas and habitats. Our
work in reducing our overall environmental footprint underscores this conviction. The Gilead Park
accentuates this by showcasing a myriad of features designed to promote biodiversity, increase
the resilience of ecological systems and enrich human experience and health.
The Gilead Park landscape draws from local plant communities to create a diverse array of flora,
including more than 20 species of trees and 115 different types of shrubs. Grasslands, riparian
planting, coastal scrub and woodland communities include plants that are hardy, conserve water
and adapt to local conditions of high groundwater, salty soils and dehydrating winds. This site is
home to a wide variety of birds and pollinators.

Sustainability is a collective effort, one that requires all of us to act and each of us to acknowledge
responsibility in accordance with our power to effect change. At Gilead, we use our influence and
implement standards and practices that encourage others to contribute to sustainability efforts.
ENGAGING SUPPLIERS TO REACH OUR CARBON GOALS
The vast majority of the emissions footprint associated with our company falls outside of our operational
control. Known as Scope 3, these are the greenhouse gases emitted by our suppliers and through
other value chain activities. Because our purchased goods and services comprise more than 80% of
these Scope 3 emissions, we have made our suppliers a central component of attaining our goals. Our
meaningful engagement with key suppliers will go a long way toward reducing our Scope 3 emissions
15% by 2030 (using 2019 as a baseline).
In 2022, we surveyed 111 suppliers representing 59% of the greenhouse gas emissions related to
our modeled Scope 3 purchased goods and services. We are currently in the process of analyzing
supplier responses to our emissions survey, which we use to assess how advanced suppliers are in
understanding and reducing their emissions. While we engaged with more suppliers in 2022 than in
2021, the suppliers engaged in 2022 represent a lower percentage of our Scope 3 emissions than
the suppliers we engaged the prior year. This is due to a variation in the group of targeted suppliers

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF CONCERNS RELATED TO TAX
We engage with tax authorities with honesty, integrity, respect and fairness and in a spirit of cooperative
compliance. Our tax positions and filings are subject to review and audit by tax authorities in jurisdictions
where we conduct business. In the course of such a review, we strive to be transparent with tax
authorities, providing relevant facts and documentation to support our tax positions and to resolve
disputes constructively and in a timely manner on current, future and past tax risks.
Where appropriate, we also seek to proactively engage with tax authorities on their interpretation
of local tax laws and their application to our specific facts and circumstances.
New tax laws and regulations often bring uncertainty in their interpretation and application, and
inconsistent treatment of a transaction by different jurisdictions brings the risk that the same income
may be taxed by two or more tax authorities. In those situations, we also seek to work with tax
authorities in a transparent manner to mitigate or, if possible, prevent double-taxation of our economic
profits, in compliance with tax treaties and applicable national legislation.
We monitor proposals and changes to tax incentives and regulations in the countries in which we
operate in order to assess their impact on our business. From time to time, Gilead may collaborate with
taxpayer advocacy groups to ensure Gilead’s views are considered during the public discourse. We also
support initiatives to increase public trust and transparency in national and international tax regimes.

Aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs)
Gilead supports all of the 17 UN SDGs. Our business activities are most aligned with the UN SDGs listed below.
Good Health and Well-Being
We deliver innovative therapies that offer new hope for patients and make our therapies broadly available to people living
with, or at risk from, life-threatening conditions. We go beyond the medicine and help remedy health inequities and other
barriers to care. Our ambitions have led us to a cure for hepatitis C and to transforming the treatment and prevention of HIV.
We continue to set our sights on curing more viral diseases and certain cancers and inflammatory diseases.
Quality Education
We educate and train healthcare providers on advanced therapies, including in resource-limited countries.
Gender Equality
We cultivate an inclusive and diverse workforce that celebrates differences in race, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender
identity and thinking style.
Clean Water and Sanitation
We have committed to achieve water neutrality in water-stressed regions by 2030 and to reduce potable water use at owned
facilities by 30% by 2030.
Affordable and Clean Energy
We generate and purchase renewable energy to offset grid-supplied energy at some of our worldwide facilities. We have
committed to 100% renewable electricity in our operations by 2025 and to transitioning our vehicle fleet to electric or low-
emissions vehicles by 2030 where technologically and financially feasible.

Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
We leverage science and innovation to develop industry-leading therapeutics for areas of unmet medical need.
Reduced Inequalities
We formed a Diversity Council in 2018 to enhance our Inclusion and Diversity initiatives worldwide.
Responsible Consumption and Production
We have committed to the following: By 2030, reduce total solid waste generated by 20% compared to 2019, including
elimination of single-use plastics (excluding R&D operations) and achieve zero-waste status through diversion programs.
By 2025, ensure 100% of our product packaging used is widely recyclable or reusable, including eliminating all unnecessary
plastics, where quality and safety permits. By 2025, increase secondary and tertiary product package composition to 30%
post-consumer recycled plastic content and 70% recycled content paper from sustainability managed forests.
Climate Action
We have committed to reducing absolute GHG emissions across our direct operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 46%, and across
our value chain (Scope 3) by 15%, by 2030, from a 2019 base year. We have committed to 100% renewable electricity in our
operations by 2025 and to transitioning our vehicle fleet to electric or low-emissions vehicles by 2030 where technologically
and financially feasible.
Partnerships for the Goals
We forge internal and external partnerships to improve patient care, strengthen health systems and reduce social and
environmental impacts.

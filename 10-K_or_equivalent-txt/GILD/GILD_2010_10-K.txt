Commercialization and Distribution
Our products are marketed through our commercial teams and/or in conjunction with third-party distributors and corporate partners. Our commercial teams
promote our products through direct field contact with physicians, hospitals, clinics and other healthcare providers. We generally grant our third-party distributors
the exclusive right to promote our product in a territory for a specified period of time. Most of our agreements with these distributors provide for collaborative efforts
between the distributor and Gilead in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for the product in the specified territory.
We have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United
States.
In the United States, our commercial team promotes Truvada, Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera, Letairis and Ranexa. We promote Atripla in the United States with our
joint venture partner, BMS. We distribute Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera, Vistide and Ranexa in the United States exclusively through the wholesale
channel. Our product sales to three large wholesalers, Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Corp. and AmerisourceBergen Corp., each accounted for more than 10% of
total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. On a combined basis, in 2010, these wholesalers accounted for approximately 82% of
our product sales in the United States and approximately 43% of our total worldwide revenues. Our corporate partner, Astellas, promotes, sells and distributes
AmBisome and Lexiscan for us in the United States. Cayston and Letairis are distributed exclusively by specialty pharmacies. These specialty pharmacies specialize
in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic conditions that may require a high level of patient education and ongoing counseling.
We sell and distribute Truvada, Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera and AmBisome in Asia, Australia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and New Zealand either
through our commercial teams, third-party distributors or corporate partners. We promote Atripla jointly with BMS in the majority of countries in Europe and are
responsible for selling and distributing the product in these countries. In a limited number of Central and Eastern European countries, either Gilead, BMS or a third-
party distributor is the sole promoting, selling and distributing company. Under an agreement with Merck & Co., Inc. (Merck), we promote and distribute Atripla in 12
countries in Latin America and Asia Pacific either through Merck or our existing third-party distributors. GSK promotes, sells and distributes Hepsera in Asia, Latin
America and certain other territories and plans to promote, sell and distribute Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in China, Japan and Saudi Arabia. We rely
on our corporate partner, Japan Tobacco Inc., to promote and sell Truvada, Viread and Emtriva in Japan. Our corporate partner, Astellas, promotes, sells and
distributes AmBisome in Canada. Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd is responsible for promotion and distribution of AmBisome in Japan. Menarini International
Operations Luxembourg SA markets Ranexa in certain territories outside of the United States for the treatment of chronic angina. Rapidscan Pharma Solutions, Inc.
markets Rapiscan (regadenoson) in certain territories outside of the United States for the inducement of pharmacological stress and/or vasodilation of the coronary
vasculature strictly for purposes of diagnosing cardiovascular disease.
Access in the Developing World
Through the Gilead Access Program, established in 2003, certain of our HIV products are available at substantially reduced prices in 130 countries in the
developing world. We have developed a system of tiered pricing that reflects economic status, using gross national income per capita (GNI) and HIV prevalence. This
approach allows us to price our therapies based on a country’s ability to pay.
We also support many clinical studies through the donation of our products to help define the best treatment strategies in developing world countries. For
example, in November 2002, we entered into a collaborative agreement with the Medical Research Council (MRC) of the United Kingdom, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH
and GSK in connection with a clinical study conducted by the MRC on antiretroviral HIV therapy in Africa. The
6Table of Contents
trial, called the DART (Development of AntiRetroviral Therapy) study, was aimed at studying clinical versus laboratory monitoring practices and structured treatment
interruptions on continuous antiretroviral therapy in adults with HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. We provided Viread at no cost for the DART study. In addition,
we donated tenofovir for the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) 004 microbicide trial, which assessed the effectiveness and the
safety of a tenofovir-based microbicide gel for the prevention of HIV infection in South African women. We also provide drugs for a number of innovative
international studies investigating whether Viread or Truvada can prevent HIV transmission among at-risk, uninfected adults. This is a potential HIV prevention
strategy called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP.
We also work closely with the World Health Organization and with non-governmental organizations to provide AmBisome for the treatment of leishmaniasis, a
parasitic disease, at a preferential price in resource limited settings. We support numerous clinical studies investigating the role of AmBisome to treat visceral and
cutaneous leishmaniasis in developing countries through collaborations with organizations such as the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative and Médecins Sans
Frontières.
We have also entered into a number of collaborations related to access to our products in the developing world, which include:
• PharmaChem Technologies (Grand Bahama), Ltd (PharmaChem). In 2005, PharmaChem, one of our commercial manufacturing partners, established a
facility in The Bahamas to manufacture tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viread and one of the active pharmaceutical
ingredients in Atripla and Truvada, for resource limited countries through a cooperative effort with PharmaChem and the Grand Bahama Port Authority.
• Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd (Aspen). In October 2005, we entered into a non-exclusive manufacturing and distribution agreement with Aspen,
providing for the manufacture and distribution of Viread and Truvada for the treatment of HIV infection to certain developing world countries included
in our Gilead Access Program. In November 2007, we amended our agreement with Aspen. Under the amended agreement, Aspen retained the right to
manufacture and distribute Viread and Truvada for the treatment of HIV infection in these developing world countries. Aspen has the right to purchase
Viread and Truvada in unlabeled bottles from us for distribution in such countries, and also has the right to manufacture Viread and Truvada using
active pharmaceutical ingredient that has been purchased by Aspen from suppliers approved by us. Aspen was also granted the right to manufacture
and distribute generic versions of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, including versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in combination
with emtricitabine for the treatment of HIV infection. Aspen is required to pay us royalties on net sales of Viread and Truvada, as well as royalties on net
sales of generic versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, including versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in combination with generic versions of
emtricitabine that are manufactured and distributed by Aspen.
• Generic Licenses. We have entered into non-exclusive license agreements with thirteen Indian generic manufacturers, granting them the rights to
produce and distribute generic versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for the treatment of HIV infection to 95 low income countries around the world,
which includes India and many of the low income countries in our Gilead Access Program. The agreements require that the generic manufacturers meet
certain national and international regulatory standards and include technology transfers to enable expeditious production of large volumes of high
quality generic versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. In addition, these agreements allow for the manufacture of commercial quantities of both active
pharmaceutical ingredient and finished product.
• Merck & Co., Inc. In August 2006, we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of Merck pursuant to which Gilead and Merck provide Atripla at
substantially reduced prices to HIV infected patients in developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America and Southeast Asia. Under the
agreement, we manufacture Atripla using efavirenz supplied by Merck, and Merck handles distribution of the product in the countries covered by the
agreement.
7Table of Contents
• International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM) and CONRAD. In December 2006, we entered into an agreement under which we granted rights to
IPM and CONRAD, a cooperating agency of the U.S. Agency for International Development committed to improving reproductive health by expanding
the contraceptive choices of women and men, to develop, manufacture, and, if proven efficacious, arrange for the distribution in resource limited
countries of certain formulations of tenofovir for use as a topical microbicide to prevent HIV infection.
Competition
Our products target a number of areas, including viral, fungal, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. There are many commercially available products for the
treatment of these diseases. Many companies and institutions are making substantial investments in developing additional products to treat these diseases. Our
products compete with other available products based primarily on:
• efficacy;
• safety;
• tolerability;
• acceptance by doctors;
• ease of patient compliance;
• patent protection;
• ease of use;
• price;
• insurance and other reimbursement coverage;
• distribution; and
• marketing.
Our HIV Products. The HIV landscape is becoming more competitive and complex as treatment trends continue to evolve. A growing number of anti-HIV drugs
are currently sold or are in advanced stages of clinical development. Of the approximately 32 branded HIV drugs available in the United States, our products primarily
compete with the fixed-dose combination products in the nucleotide/nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) class, including Combivir
(lamivudine/zidovudine), Epzicom/Kivexa (abacavir/lamivudine) and Trizivir (abacavir/lamivudine/zidovudine), each sold by a joint venture established in November
2009 by GSK and Pfizer focused on HIV therapies. Our HIV products also compete broadly with HIV products from Abbott Laboratories, Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim
GmbH, Merck, Roche and Tibotec Pharmaceuticals.
BMS’s Videx EC (didanosine, ddI) became the first generic HIV product in the United States in 2004. GSK’s Retrovir (zidovudine) also faces generic
competition in the United States as a result of the launch of generic zidovudine in 2005. BMS’s Zerit (stavudine) also faces generic competition in the United States
as a result of the launch of generic stavudine in 2008. To date, there has been little impact from generic didanosine, zidovudine or stavudine on the price of our HIV
products; however, price decreases for all HIV products may result in the longer term.
Lamivudine, marketed by the joint venture established by GSK and Pfizer, is competitive with emtricitabine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Emtriva and
a component of both Atripla and Truvada. In May 2010, the compound patent covering Epivir (lamivudine) itself expired in the United States, and we expect to see
generic lamivudine in the United States in the near future. Generic lamivudine has been available in Spain since March 2010. We expect that generic versions of
lamivudine will be launched in other countries within the European Union as early as the first quarter of 2011.
8Table of Contents
Our HBV Products. Our hepatitis B virus (HBV) products, Hepsera and Viread, face significant competition from existing and expected therapies for treating
patients with chronic hepatitis B. Our HBV products face competition from Baraclude (entecavir), an oral nucleoside analogue developed by BMS and launched in the
United States in 2005, and Tyzeka/Sebivo (telbivudine), an oral nucleoside analogue developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Novartis) for sale in the
United States, the European Union and China.
Our HBV products also compete with Epivir-HBV/Zeffix (lamivudine), which was developed by GSK in collaboration with Shire Pharmaceuticals Group PLC and
is sold in the major countries throughout North and South America, Europe and Asia.
Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B also compete with established immunomodulatory therapies, including Intron-A (interferon alfa-2b),
which is sold by Schering Plough Corporation in major countries throughout North and South America, Europe and Asia, and Pegasys (pegylated interferon alfa-2a),
an injectable drug similar to Intron-A sold by Roche for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.
Our Cardiovascular Products.
Letairis competes directly with Tracleer (bosentan) sold by Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (Actelion) and indirectly with a PAH product from United
Therapeutics Corporation.
Ranexa competes predominantly with generic compounds from three distinct classes of drugs for the treatment of chronic angina in the United States,
including generic and/or branded beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and long-acting nitrates. In addition, surgical treatments and interventions such as
coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention can be another option for angina patients, and may be perceived by healthcare practitioners
as preferred methods to treat the cardiovascular disease that underlies and causes angina.
In the United States, there are numerous marketed generic and/or branded pharmacologic stress agents that compete with Lexiscan. Clinical Data, Inc. is
developing apadenoson as a pharmacologic stress agent for MPI which is currently in Phase 3 clinical trials. These stress agents and product candidates could also
compete with Lexiscan.
Our Other Products.
AmBisome faces strong competition from several current and expected competitors. Competition from these current and expected competitors may erode the
revenues we receive from sales of AmBisome. AmBisome faces competition from Vfend (voriconazole) developed by Pfizer and caspofungin, a product developed by
Merck that is marketed as Cancidas in the United States and as Caspofungin elsewhere. AmBisome also competes with other lipid-based amphotericin B products,
including Abelcet (amphotericin B lipid complex injection), sold by Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the United States, Canada and Japan and by Zeneus Pharma Ltd. in
Europe; Amphotec (amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate complex for injection), sold by Three Rivers Pharmaceuticals, LLC worldwide; and Anfogen (amphotericin B
liposomal), sold by Genpharma, S.A. in Argentina. BMS and numerous generic manufacturers sell conventional amphotericin B, which also competes with AmBisome.
We are aware of at least two lipid formulations that claim similarity to AmBisome becoming available outside of the United States, including the possible entry
of one such formulation in Greece. These formulations may reduce market demand for AmBisome. The manufacture of lipid formulations of amphotericin B is very
complex, and if any of these formulations are found to be unsafe, sales of AmBisome may be negatively impacted by association.
9Table of Contents
Vistide competes with a number of drugs that also treat cytomegalovirus retinitis, including Cytovene IV and Cytovene (ganciclovir), sold in intravenous and
oral formulations by Roche and as an ocular implant by Bausch & Lomb Incorporated; Valcyte (valganciclovir), also marketed by Roche; Foscavir (foscarnet), an
intravenous drug sold by AstraZeneca PLC; and Vitravene (fomivirsen), a drug injected directly into the eye, sold by CibaVision.
Cayston competes primarily with Tobi (tobramycin inhalation solution, USP), an inhaled medication sold by Novartis for the treatment of CF patients whose
lungs contain P. aeruginosa.
Tamiflu competes with Relenza (zanamivir), an anti-influenza drug that is sold by GSK. Relenza is a neuraminidase inhibitor that is delivered as an orally-inhaled
dry powder. Generic competitors include amantadine and rimantadine, both oral tablets that only inhibit the replication of the influenza A virus. BioCryst
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing injectable formulations of peramivir, an influenza neuraminidase inhibitor, for the treatment of influenza, which are currently in
Phase 3 clinical trials.
Macugen competes primarily with Visudyne (verteporfin for injection), which is sold by Novartis and used in connection with photodynamic therapy, and
Lucentis (ranibizumab), which is sold by Genentech, Inc.
A number of companies are pursuing the development of technologies which are competitive with our research programs. These competing companies include
specialized pharmaceutical firms and large pharmaceutical companies acting either independently or together with other pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore,
academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection and may establish
collaborative arrangements for competitive products and programs.
Collaborative Relationships
As part of our business strategy, we establish collaborations with other companies, universities and medical research institutions to assist in the clinical
development and/or commercialization of certain of our products and product candidates and to provide support for our research programs. We also evaluate
opportunities for acquiring products or rights to products and technologies that are complementary to our business from other companies, universities and medical
research institutions. More information regarding certain of these relationships, including their ongoing financial and accounting impact on our business can be
found in Item 8, Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Commercial Collaborations
Although we currently have a number of collaborations with corporate partners that govern the manufacture, sale, distribution and/or marketing of our
products in various territories worldwide, the following commercial collaborations are those that are most significant to us from a financial statement perspective and
where significant ongoing collaboration activity exists.
• Roche. In September 1996, we entered into a development and license agreement with Roche to develop and commercialize therapies to treat and prevent
viral influenza. Tamiflu, an antiviral oral formulation for the treatment and prevention of influenza, was co-developed by us and Roche. Under the original
agreement, Roche had the exclusive right and obligation to manufacture and sell Tamiflu worldwide, subject to its obligation to pay us a percentage of
the net sales that Roche generated from Tamiflu sales. Under the agreement, we received an up-front payment in the amount of $5.0 million and were
entitled to receive additional milestone payments of up to $40.0 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory objectives. We
have received all such milestone payments. In October 1996, Roche also made a cash payment to us in the amount of $5.3 million related to
reimbursement for certain research and preclinical development expenses and our obligation
10Table of Contents
to prosecute and maintain certain patents under the agreement. In November 2005, we entered into a first amendment and supplement to the original
agreement with Roche. The amendment eliminated cost of goods adjustments from the royalty calculation, retroactive to calendar year 2004 and for all
future calculations. The amendment also provided for the formation of a joint manufacturing committee to review Roche’s manufacturing capacity for
Tamiflu and global plans for manufacturing Tamiflu, a U.S. commercial committee to evaluate commercial plans and strategies for Tamiflu in the United
States and a joint supervisory committee to evaluate Roche’s overall commercial plans for Tamiflu on a global basis. Each of the committees consists of
representatives from both Roche and us. Under the amendment, we have the option to provide a specialized sales force to supplement Roche’s U.S.
marketing efforts for Tamiflu, which we have not exercised to date. The agreement and Roche’s obligation to pay royalties to us will terminate on a
country-by-country basis as patents providing exclusivity for Tamiflu in such countries expire. Roche may terminate the agreement for any reason in
which case all rights to Tamiflu would revert to us. Either party may terminate the agreement in response to a material breach by the other party.
• BMS. In December 2004, we entered into a collaboration with BMS to develop and commercialize the single-tablet regimen of our Truvada and BMS’s
Sustiva in the United States. This combination was approved for use in the United States in July 2006 and is sold under the brand name Atripla. We and
BMS structured this collaboration as a joint venture by forming a limited liability company called Bristol-Myers Squibb & Gilead Sciences, LLC. Under
the terms of the collaboration, we and BMS granted royalty free sublicenses to the joint venture for the use of our respective company owned
technologies and, in return, were granted a license by the joint venture to use any intellectual property that results from the collaboration. The economic
interests of the joint venture held by us and BMS (including share of revenues and out-of-pocket expenses) are based on the portion of the net selling
price of Atripla attributable to Truvada and Sustiva, respectively. Since the net selling price for Truvada may change over time relative to the net selling
price of Sustiva, both our and BMS’s respective economic interests in the joint venture may vary annually. We and BMS share marketing and sales
efforts, with both parties providing equivalent sales force efforts at levels agreed to annually by BMS and Gilead. Starting in the second quarter of 2011,
except for a limited number of activities that will be jointly managed, the parties will no longer coordinate detailing and promotional activities in the
United States. The parties will continue to collaborate on activities such as manufacturing, regulatory, compliance and pharmacovigilance. The daily
operations of the joint venture are governed by four primary joint committees formed by both BMS and Gilead. We are responsible for accounting,
financial reporting, tax reporting and product distribution for the joint venture. In September 2006, we and BMS amended the joint venture’s
collaboration agreement to allow the joint venture to sell Atripla into Canada. The agreement will continue until terminated by the mutual agreement of
the parties. In addition, either party may terminate the other party’s participation in the collaboration within 30 days after the launch of at least one
generic version of such other party’s single agent products (or the double agent products). The non-terminated party then has the right to continue to
sell Atripla and a short-term obligation to pay royalties to the terminated party.
In December 2007, we entered into a collaboration with BMS which sets forth the terms and conditions under which we and BMS commercialize Atripla
in the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Either we, BMS or a third-party distributor act as the selling party in these
countries and are responsible for, among other things, receiving and processing customer orders, warehousing product, collecting receivables and
handling returns. Manufacturing of Atripla is coordinated by us, and we are primarily responsible for distribution logistics. In general, the parties share
revenues and out-of-pocket expenses in proportion to the net selling prices of Truvada, with respect to us, and efavirenz, with respect to BMS. The
agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last-to-expire patent which affords market exclusivity to Atripla or one of its components in the
European countries covered by the agreement. Prior to such time, either party may terminate the agreement for any reason, with such termination to be
effective in December 2013. The non-terminating party has the right to continue to sell Atripla, but will be obligated to pay the
11Table of Contents
terminating party certain royalties for a three year period following the effective date of the termination. In the event the non-terminating party decides
not to sell Atripla, the effective date of the termination will be the date Atripla is withdrawn in each country or the date on which a third party assumes
distribution of Atripla, whichever is earlier.
• GSK. In March 2006, we sublicensed to GSK exclusive rights to market ambrisentan (the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Letairis) under the name
Volibris for PAH in territories outside of the United States. Under the license agreement, we received an up-front payment of $20.0 million and, subject to
the achievement of specific milestones, we are eligible to receive total additional milestone payments of $80.0 million. Through December 31, 2010, we
have received $45.0 million of such potential milestone payments. In addition, we will receive royalties based on net sales of Volibris in the GSK
territories. GSK has an option to negotiate from us an exclusive sublicense for additional therapeutic uses for Volibris in the GSK territories during the
term of the license agreement. Under the agreement, we will continue to conduct and bear the expense of all clinical development activities that we
believe are required to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for Letairis and Volibris in the United States, Canada and the European Economic Area,
and each party may conduct additional development activities in its territories at its own expense. The parties may agree to jointly develop ambrisentan
for new indications in the licensed field, and each party will pay its share of external costs associated with such joint development. The agreement and
GSK’s obligation to pay royalties to us will terminate on a country-by-country basis on the earlier of the date on which generic equivalents sold in a
country achieve a certain percentage of total prescriptions for the product plus its generic equivalents or the fifteenth anniversary of commercial launch
in such country. GSK may terminate the agreement for any reason. Upon such termination, all rights to the product would revert to us. Either party may
terminate the agreement in response to a material breach by the other party.
Research Collaborations
We currently have a number of collaborations with corporate partners that govern our research and development (R&D) of certain compounds and drug
candidates. The following research collaborations are those that are most significant to us from a financial statement perspective and where significant ongoing
collaboration activity exists.
• Japan Tobacco Inc. (Japan Tobacco). In March 2005, we entered into a licensing agreement with Japan Tobacco, under which Japan Tobacco granted us
exclusive rights to develop and commercialize elvitegravir, a novel HIV integrase inhibitor, in all countries of the world, excluding Japan, where Japan
Tobacco would retain such rights. Under the agreement, we are responsible for seeking regulatory approval in our territories and are required to use
diligent efforts to commercialize a product for the treatment of HIV infection. We will bear all costs and expenses associated with such commercialization
efforts. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid an up-front license fee of $15.0 million and are obligated to make total potential milestone payments of
up to $90.0 million upon the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and commercial objectives. Additionally, we are obligated to pay royalties based
on any net sales in the territories where we market the product. Through December 31, 2010, we have made total milestone payments of $12.0 million. The
agreement and our obligation to pay royalties to Japan Tobacco will terminate on a product-by-product basis as patents providing exclusivity for the
product expire or, if later, on the tenth anniversary of commercial launch for such product. We may terminate the agreement for any reason in which case
the license granted by Japan Tobacco to us would terminate. Either party may terminate the agreement in response to a material breach by the other
party.
• Tibotec Pharmaceuticals (Tibotec). In July 2009, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Tibotec, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Johnson & Johnson, under which we will develop and commercialize a fixed-dose combination of our Truvada and Tibotec’s non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor, TMC278 (25 mg rilpivirine hydrochloride). Under the agreement, Tibotec granted us an exclusive license to the combination
product for administration to adults in a
12Table of Contents
once-daily, oral dosage form, worldwide excluding developing world countries and Japan. Neither party is restricted from combining its drugs with any
other drugs. We will reimburse Tibotec up to €71.5 million of Tibotec’s development costs for TMC278 and are required to use commercially reasonable
efforts to develop and formulate the combination product, including completion of bioequivalence studies. Through December 31, 2010, we recorded
€53.6 million (approximately $74.5 million) in reimbursable R&D expenses incurred by Tibotec in the development of TMC278. Tibotec is required to use
commercially reasonable efforts to develop TMC278 and obtain its approval in the United States and Europe. We will manufacture the combination
product and assume the lead role in registration, distribution and, subject to regulatory approval, commercialization of the combination product in the
licensed countries. Tibotec will have the right to detail the combination product in the licensed countries, and, at its option, can request that it be the
distributor of the combination product in a limited number of such countries. The price of the combination product is expected to be the sum of the
prices of Truvada and TMC278 components. The cost of TMC278 purchased by us from Tibotec for the combination product will approximate the
market price of TMC278, less a specified percentage of up to thirty percent.
Either party may terminate the agreement if the combination product is withdrawn from the market, if the other party materially breaches the agreement or
if certain clinical or regulatory conditions are not met. We may terminate the agreement in the United States and Canada on or after the expiration of the
last-to-expire patent for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the United States, and may terminate the agreement in any other country on or after the
expiration of the last-to-expire patent for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in a country of the European Union. Tibotec may terminate the agreement in the
United States and Canada on or after the expiration of the last–to-expire patent for TMC278 in the United States, and may terminate the agreement in any
other country on or after the expiration of the last-to-expire patent for TMC278 in a country of the European Union.
Research and Development
Our product development efforts cover a wide range of medical conditions, including HIV/AIDS, liver disease, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease.
We have research scientists in Foster City, Palo Alto and San Dimas, California; Branford, Connecticut; and Seattle, Washington, engaged in the discovery
and development of new molecules and technologies that we hope will lead to new medicines and novel formulations of existing drugs.
Below is a summary of our key product candidates and their corresponding current stages of development. For additional information on our development

Truvada/TMC278 In September 2010, we announced that we had submitted a new drug application to the European Medicines
Single-Tablet Regimen Agency for marketing approval of the single-tablet regimen of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, emtricitabine and
TMC278 for the treatment of HIV/AIDS in treatment-naive patients. In November 2010, we submitted a new
drug application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this single-tablet regimen. In January
2011, we received a “refuse to file” notification from the FDA regarding our application. The FDA requested
additional information with respect to the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls section of the application. In
February 2011, we re-filed our new drug application, which included the requested information, and are
awaiting the FDA’s response as to whether it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review.

Patents and Proprietary Rights
U.S. and European Patent Expiration

Patent Protection and Certain Challenges
Patents and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. If we have a properly designed and enforceable patent, it can be more difficult for our
competitors to use our technology to create competitive products and more difficult for our competitors to obtain a patent that prevents us from using technology we
create. As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent protection both in the United States and internationally and file additional patent applications, when
appropriate, to cover improvements in our compounds, products and technology. We also rely on trade secrets, internal know-how, technological innovations and
agreements with third parties to develop, maintain and protect our competitive position. Our ability to be competitive will depend on the success of this strategy.
Patents covering the active pharmaceutical ingredients of Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera, Letairis, Vistide and Lexiscan are held by third parties.
We acquired exclusive rights to these patents in the agreements we have with these parties. Patents do not cover ranolazine, the active ingredient of Ranexa. Instead,
when it was discovered that only a sustained release formulation of ranolazine would achieve therapeutic plasma
16Table of Contents
levels, patents were obtained on those formulations and the characteristic plasma levels they achieve. Patents do not cover the active ingredients in AmBisome.
Instead, we hold patents to the liposomal formulations of this compound and also protect formulations through trade secrets. In addition, we do not have patent
filings in China or certain other Asian countries covering all forms of adefovir dipivoxil, the active ingredient in Hepsera. Asia is a major market for therapies for
hepatitis B, the indication for which Hepsera has been developed.
We may obtain patents for certain products many years before we obtain marketing approval for those products. Because patents have a limited life, which
may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of the patent may be limited. However, we may be able to apply for patent
term extensions. For example, extensions for the patents on many of our products have been granted in the United States and in a number of European countries,
compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval. Similar patent term extensions may be available for other products that we are developing, but we
cannot be certain we will obtain them.
It is also very important that we do not infringe patents or proprietary rights of others and that we do not violate the agreements that grant proprietary rights to
us. If we do infringe patents or violate these agreements, we could be prevented from developing or selling products or from using the processes covered by those
patents or agreements, or we could be required to obtain a license from third parties to allow us to use their technology. We cannot be certain that, if required, we
could obtain a license to any third-party technology or that we could obtain one at a reasonable cost. If we were not able to obtain a required license or alternative
technologies, we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products, and our business could be adversely affected. For example, we are aware of a
body of patents that may relate to our operation of Letairis Education and Access Program (LEAP), our restricted distribution program designed to support Letairis.
Because patent applications are confidential for a period of time until a patent is issued, we may not know if our competitors have filed patent applications for
technology covered by our pending applications or if we were the first to invent the technology that is the subject of our patent applications. Competitors may have
filed patent applications or received patents and may obtain additional patents and proprietary rights that block or compete with our patents. If competitors file patent
applications covering our technology, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or litigation to determine the right to a patent. Litigation and
interference proceedings are expensive, such that, even if we are ultimately successful, our results of operations may be adversely affected by participation in such
events.
Patents relating to pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology products, compounds and processes such as those that cover our existing
compounds, products and processes and those that we will likely file in the future, do not always provide complete or adequate protection. Future litigation or re-
examination proceedings regarding the enforcement or validity of our existing patents or any future patents could invalidate our patents or substantially reduce their
protection. For example, in 2007, the Public Patent Foundation filed requests for re-examination with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) challenging
four of our patents related to tenofovir disoproxil and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which is an active pharmaceutical ingredient in Atripla, Truvada and Viread. The
PTO granted these requests and issued non-final rejections for the four patents, which is a step common in a proceeding to initiate the re-examination process. In
2008, the PTO confirmed the patentability of all four patents.
Although we were successful in responding to the PTO actions in the instance above, similar organizations may still challenge our patents in foreign
jurisdictions. For example, in April 2008, the Brazilian Health Ministry, citing the U.S. patent re-examination proceedings as grounds for rejection, requested that the
Brazilian patent authority issue a decision that is not supportive of our patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in Brazil. In August 2008, an examiner in
the Brazilian patent authority issued a final rejection of our fumarate salt patent application, the only patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate we have filed
in Brazil. We then filed an appeal within the patent authority responding to the questions raised in the rejection. In July 2009, the Brazilian patent authority again
rejected the application. This was the highest level of appeal available to us
17Table of Contents
within the Brazilian patent authority. We have filed a civil action in Brazilian federal court to further appeal the action of the Brazilian patent authority. We cannot
predict the outcome of this proceeding on our tenofovir disoproxil fumarate patent application. If we are unsuccessful in our appeal to the courts of the decision by
the patent authority, the Brazilian government would likely purchase generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which would significantly reduce our sales of HIV
products in Brazil. In 2010, the Brazilian government purchased approximately $50 million of our HIV products. Further, we are aware of applications from two generic
companies to sell a generic version of Viread in Brazil. If one or both of these generic applicants are able to compete for this contract for 2011, we would not expect
the Brazilian government to purchase any of our HIV products in 2011.
As another example, the Patent Office of India initially allowed our claims covering tenofovir disoproxil and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. However, under
Indian civil procedure, prior to the official grant of the allowed applications, several parties filed legal actions to protest the decision to grant the patents. In August
2009, the Indian Patent Office announced that it had decided these actions against us and would not therefore allow the patents to be granted. We have filed an
appeal within the Indian Patent Office Intellectual Property Appellate Board on both of these applications. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. If
we are unsuccessful in our appeal of these decisions, any further appeals will have to be pursued in the Indian court system, and may ultimately prove unsuccessful.
In the meantime, any competitor is able to sell generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in India. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in appealing any further negative
decisions by the Indian Patent Office in the Indian courts, these competitors would be able to continue to sell generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which could
reduce the amount of royalties we receive from our Indian generic licenses.
Our pending patent applications and the patent applications filed by our collaborative partners may not result in the issuance of any patents or may result in
patents that do not provide adequate protection. As a result, we may not be able to prevent third parties from developing compounds or products that are closely
related to those which we have developed or are developing. In addition, certain countries in Africa and Asia, including China, do not provide effective enforcement
of our patents, and third-party manufacturers are able to sell generic versions of our products in those countries.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications Filed by Generic Manufacturers
As part of the approval process of some of our products, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an exclusivity period during which other
manufacturers’ applications for approval of generic versions of our product will not be granted. Generic manufacturers often wait to challenge the patents protecting
products that have been granted exclusivity until one year prior to the end of the exclusivity period. From time to time, we have received notices from manufacturers
indicating that they intend to import chemical intermediates possibly for use in making our products. In addition, generic manufacturers have sought and may
continue to seek FDA approval for a similar or identical drug through an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), the application form typically used by
manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug.
For example, in November 2008, we received notice that Teva Pharmaceuticals (Teva) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture
and market a generic version of Truvada. In the notice, Teva alleges that two of the patents associated with emtricitabine are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be
infringed by Teva’s manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Truvada. In December 2008, we filed a lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the two
emtricitabine patents. In March 2009, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic
version of Atripla. In the notice, Teva challenged the same two emtricitabine patents. In May 2009, we filed another lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the two
emtricitabine patents, and this lawsuit was consolidated with the lawsuit filed in December 2008. In January 2010, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA
to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Viread. In the notice, Teva challenged four of the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
patents protecting Viread. In January 2010, we also received notices from Teva amending its ANDAs related to Atripla and Truvada. In the notice related to Truvada,
Teva challenged four
18Table of Contents
patents related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and two additional patents related to emtricitabine. In the notice related to Atripla, Teva challenged four patents
related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, two additional patents related to emtricitabine and two patents related to efavirenz. In March 2010, we filed a lawsuit against
Teva for infringement of the four Viread patents and two additional emtricitabine patents. In March 2010, BMS and Merck filed a lawsuit against Teva for
infringement of the patents related to efavirenz.
In June 2010, we received notice that Lupin Limited (Lupin) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic
version of Ranexa. In the notice, Lupin alleges that ten of the patents associated with Ranexa are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Lupin’s
manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Ranexa. In July 2010, we filed a lawsuit against Lupin for infringement of our patents for Ranexa.
In August 2010, we received notice that Sigmapharm Labs (Sigmapharm) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a
generic version of Hepsera. In the notice, Sigmapharm alleges that both of the patents associated with Hepsera are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed
by Sigmapharm’s manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Hepsera. In September 2010, we filed a lawsuit against Sigmapharm for infringement of our patents
for Hepsera. One of the patents challenged by Sigmapharm is also being challenged by Ranbaxy, Inc. (Ranbaxy) pursuant to a notice received in October 2010. The
patent challenged by Ranbaxy expires in July 2018. We are considering our options for enforcing our patent.
In February 2011, we received notice that Natco Pharma Limited (Natco) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a
generic version of Tamiflu. In the notice, Natco alleges that a patent associated with Tamiflu is invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Natco’s
manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Tamiflu. We are currently reviewing the notice letter and have 45 days from the date of receipt to commence a patent
infringement lawsuit against Natco.
We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, and we may spend significant resources enforcing these patents. If we are unsuccessful in these
lawsuits, some or all of our original claims in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated and the patent protection for Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Ranexa and
Tamiflu in the United States could be substantially shortened. Further, if all of the patents covering those products are invalidated, the FDA could approve the
requests to manufacture a generic version of such products prior to the expiration date of those patents.
Trade Secrets
We also rely on unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented internal know-how and technological innovation. In particular, a great deal of our
liposomal manufacturing expertise, which is a key component of our liposomal technology, is not covered by patents but is instead protected as a trade secret. We
protect these rights mainly through confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants and vendors. These agreements provide that all
confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with us will be kept confidential and will not be used or
disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions made by an individual while
employed by us will be our exclusive property. We cannot be certain that these parties will comply with these confidentiality agreements, that we have adequate
remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. Under some of our R&D
agreements, inventions become jointly owned by us and our corporate partner and in other cases become the exclusive property of one party. In certain
circumstances, it can be difficult to determine who owns a particular invention and disputes could arise regarding those inventions.
19Table of Contents
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
Our manufacturing strategy is to contract with third parties to manufacture the majority of our active pharmaceutical ingredients and solid dose products. We
also rely on our corporate partners to manufacture certain of our products. Additionally, we own manufacturing facilities in San Dimas, California; Edmonton, Alberta,
Canada; and Cork, Ireland, where we manufacture certain products and active pharmaceutical ingredients for clinical and commercial uses.
Manufacturing of our Products
We contract with third parties to manufacture certain products for clinical and commercial purposes, including Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera,
Ranexa, Vistide and Cayston. We use multiple third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in
Viread and one of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in Atripla and Truvada; and emtricitabine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Emtriva and one of the
active pharmaceutical ingredients in Atripla and Truvada. We rely on a single third-party manufacturer to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients of
Ranexa and Cayston. We are in the process of validating a second manufacturer for Ranexa and Cayston.
We also rely on third-party contract manufacturers to tablet or capsulate products. For example, we use multiple third-party contract manufacturers to tablet
Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Hepsera and Ranexa. Emtriva capsulation is also completed by third-party contract manufacturers. We rely on a single third-party supplier to
manufacture Emtriva capsules and Letairis tablets.
We also have manufacturing agreements with many of our corporate partners. Roche, by itself and through third parties, is responsible for the manufacturing
of Tamiflu. Under our agreement with Roche, through a joint manufacturing committee composed of representatives from Roche and us, we have the opportunity to
review Roche’s existing manufacturing capacity for Tamiflu and global plans for manufacturing Tamiflu. Astellas US LLC, our corporate partner for Lexiscan in the
United States, is responsible for the commercial manufacture and supply of product in the United States and is dependent on a single supplier for the active
pharmaceutical ingredient of Lexiscan. PARI Pharma GmbH is responsible for the manufacturing of the device required to administer Cayston to the lungs of patients.
This device is made by a single supplier at a single site.
For our future products, we will continue to consider developing additional manufacturing capabilities and establishing additional third-party suppliers to
manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates to undertake clinical trials and to manufacture sufficient quantities of any product that is approved for
commercial sale. If we are unable to develop manufacturing capabilities internally or contract for large scale manufacturing with third parties on acceptable terms for
our future products, our ability to conduct large scale clinical trials and meet customer demand for commercial products will be adversely affected.
Our Manufacturing Facilities
At our San Dimas facility, we manufacture, fill and package products. We manufacture AmBisome and Cayston exclusively at this facility. We depend on a
single supplier for high quality cholesterol, which is used in the manufacture of AmBisome. We fill and finish Macugen exclusively at our facilities in San Dimas
under our manufacturing agreements with Eyetech and Pfizer. Eyetech currently provides us with pegaptanib sodium, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in
Macugen. We also fill and package drug product for Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera and Ranexa in their finished forms at our facilities in San Dimas. In the
event of a disaster, including an earthquake, equipment failure or other difficulty, we may be unable to replace this manufacturing capacity in a timely manner and may
be unable to manufacture AmBisome, Cayston and Macugen to meet market needs.
At our Edmonton, Alberta facility, we carry out process research and scale-up of our clinical development candidates, manufacture active pharmaceutical
ingredients for both investigational and commercial products and
20Table of Contents
conduct chemical development activities to improve existing commercial manufacturing processes. In addition, we utilize this site for the manufacture of emtricitabine.
We also manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients in Vistide, Letairis and Hepsera exclusively at our Edmonton site, although another supplier is qualified to
make the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Letairis.
We fill and package drug product for Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Emtriva, Cayston and Hepsera in their finished forms at our facilities in Cork, Ireland. We also
perform quality control testing, final labeling and packaging of AmBisome and final release of many of our products for the European Union and elsewhere at this
facility. We utilize our Cork, Ireland facility primarily for solid dose tablet manufacturing of certain of our antiviral products, as well as product packaging activities.
We distribute our products to the European Union and other international markets from our Dublin, Ireland site.
Third-party Manufacturers
Our third-party manufacturers and our corporate partners are independent entities who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risks which are
out of our control. If we or any of our third-party manufacturers or our corporate partners fail to perform as required, this could impair our ability to deliver our
products on a timely basis or receive royalties or cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. To the extent these risks materialize and
affect their performance obligations to us, our financial results may be adversely affected.
We believe the technology we use to manufacture our products is proprietary. For products manufactured by our third-party contract manufacturers, we have
disclosed all necessary aspects of this technology to enable them to manufacture the products for us. We have agreements with these third-party manufacturers that
are intended to restrict these manufacturers from using or revealing this technology, but we cannot be certain that these third-party manufacturers will comply with
these restrictions. In addition, these third-party manufacturers could develop their own technology related to the work they perform for us that we may need to
manufacture our products. We could be required to enter into additional agreements with these third-party manufacturers if we want to use that technology ourselves
or allow another manufacturer to use that technology. The third-party manufacturer could refuse to allow us to use their technology or could demand terms to use
their technology that are not acceptable to us.
Regulation of Manufacturing Process
The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not
comply with regulations. We, our third-party manufacturers and our corporate partners are subject to current Good Manufacturing Practices, which are extensive
regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards as defined by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency.
Similar regulations are in effect in other countries.
In January and February 2010, the FDA conducted a routine inspection of our San Dimas, California, manufacturing and distribution facility, where we
manufacture AmBisome and Cayston, fill and finish Macugen, and package solid dosage form products. At the conclusion of that inspection, the FDA issued Form
483 Inspectional Observations stating concerns over: the maintenance of aseptic processing conditions in the manufacturing suite for our AmBisome product;
environmental maintenance issues in the San Dimas warehousing facility; batch sampling; and the timeliness of completion of annual product quality reports. On
September 24, 2010, our San Dimas manufacturing facility received a Warning Letter from the FDA further detailing the FDA’s concerns over the AmBisome
manufacturing environment, including control systems and monitoring, procedures to prevent microbiological contamination and preventative cleaning and
equipment maintenance. Referencing certain Viread lots, the letter also stated concerns connected with quality procedures, controls and investigation procedures,
and a generalized concern over the effectiveness of the San Dimas quality unit in carrying out its responsibilities.
21Table of Contents
In November and December 2010, the FDA re-inspected the San Dimas facility. The re-inspection closed with no additional Form 483 observations.
Consequently, we believe that we have addressed the FDA’s concerns as stated in the Form 483 observations and the Warning Letter, but we are awaiting
confirmation of acceptance from the FDA.
Unless and until we receive confirmation from the FDA that it is satisfied we have corrected outstanding issues, the FDA may withhold permission to export
AmBisome and Cayston manufactured at San Dimas to certain countries outside the United States and Europe. The FDA may also withhold approval of pending drug
applications listing the San Dimas facility. Since, as required, we have notified appropriate international regulatory authorities of the letter’s issuance, it is possible
that the letter may impact our ability to supply our aseptic products manufactured at San Dimas (AmBisome, Cayston and Macugen) outside the United States. If as a
result of a Warning Letter, we are unable to receive export or regulatory approvals for AmBisome or any other products at issue, we may be unable to sell sufficient
quantities of these products to meet market demand, which would decrease our revenues and harm our business. We do not believe the Warning Letter will impact
our ability to supply any of the solid dosage form products that we package at the San Dimas facility, which include Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera,
Letairis and Ranexa. In the event our solid dosage form products were affected, we have alternate sites from which we could supply such products
Access to Supplies and Materials
We need access to certain supplies and products to manufacture our products. If delivery of material from our suppliers were interrupted for any reason or if
we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of raw materials used to manufacture our products, we may be unable to ship certain of our products for commercial
supply or to supply our product candidates in development for clinical trials. For example, a significant portion of the raw materials and intermediates used to
manufacture our HIV products (Atripla, Truvada, Viread and Emtriva) are supplied by Chinese-based companies. As a result, an international trade dispute between
China and the United States or any other actions by the Chinese government that would limit or prevent Chinese companies from supplying these materials would
adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply our HIV products to meet market needs and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results.
Seasonal Operations and Backlog
Our worldwide product sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality. However, our royalty revenues, which represented about 7% of our total
revenues in 2010 and consisted primarily of Tamiflu royalties, are affected by seasonality. Royalty revenue that we recognize from Roche’s sales of Tamiflu can be
impacted by the severity of flu seasons and product delivery in response to the H1N1 influenza pandemic.
For the most part, we operate in markets characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs. We do not believe that backlog information
is material to our business as a whole.
Government Regulation
Our operations and activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United
States, drugs are subject to rigorous FDA regulation. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the
testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. As a result of these regulations,
product development and product approval processes are very expensive and time consuming.
The FDA must approve a drug before it can be sold in the United States. The general process for this approval is as follows:
22Table of Contents
Preclinical Testing
Before we can test a drug candidate in humans, we must study the drug in laboratory experiments and in animals to generate data to support the drug
candidate’s potential benefits and safety. We submit this data to the FDA in an investigational new drug (IND) application seeking its approval to test the compound
in humans.
Clinical Trials
If the FDA accepts the investigational new drug application, the drug candidate can then be studied in human clinical trials to determine if the drug candidate
is safe and effective. These clinical trials involve three separate phases that often overlap, can take many years and are very expensive. These three phases, which are
subject to considerable regulation, are as follows:
• Phase 1. The drug candidate is given to a small number of healthy human control subjects or patients suffering from the indicated disease, to test for
safety, dose tolerance, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
• Phase 2. The drug candidate is given to a limited patient population to determine the effect of the drug candidate in treating the disease, the best dose of
the drug candidate, and the possible side effects and safety risks of the drug candidate. It is not uncommon for a drug candidate that appears promising
in Phase 1 clinical trials to fail in the more rigorous Phase 2 clinical trials.
• Phase 3. If a drug candidate appears to be effective and safe in Phase 2 clinical trials, Phase 3 clinical trials are commenced to confirm those results.
Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted over a longer term, involve a significantly larger population, are conducted at numerous sites in different geographic
regions and are carefully designed to provide reliable and conclusive data regarding the safety and benefits of a drug candidate. It is not uncommon for
a drug candidate that appears promising in Phase 2 clinical trials to fail in the more rigorous and extensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
FDA Approval Process
When we believe that the data from the Phase 3 clinical trials show an adequate level of safety and efficacy, we submit the appropriate filing, usually in the
form of a new drug application (NDA) or supplemental NDA, with the FDA seeking approval to sell the drug candidate for a particular use. The FDA may hold a
public hearing where an independent advisory committee of expert advisors asks additional questions and makes recommendations regarding the drug candidate.
This committee makes a recommendation to the FDA that is not binding but is generally followed by the FDA. If the FDA agrees that the compound has met the
required level of safety and efficacy for a particular use, it will allow us to sell the drug candidate in the United States for that use. It is not unusual, however, for the
FDA to reject an application because it believes that the drug candidate is not safe enough or efficacious enough or because it does not believe that the data
submitted is reliable or conclusive.
At any point in this process, the development of a drug candidate can be stopped for a number of reasons including safety concerns and lack of treatment
benefit. We cannot be certain that any clinical trials that we are currently conducting or any that we conduct in the future will be completed successfully or within
any specified time period. We may choose, or the FDA may require us, to delay or suspend our clinical trials at any time if it appears that the patients are being
exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if the drug candidate does not appear to have sufficient treatment benefit.
The FDA may also require Phase 4 non-registrational studies to explore scientific questions to further characterize safety and efficacy during commercial use of
our drug. The FDA may also require us to provide additional data or information, improve our manufacturing processes, procedures or facilities or may require
extensive surveillance to monitor the safety or benefits of our product candidates if it determines that our filing does not contain adequate evidence of the safety and
benefits of the drug. In addition, even if the FDA approves a drug, it could limit the uses of the drug. The FDA can withdraw approvals if it does not believe that we
are complying with regulatory standards or if problems are uncovered or occur after approval.
23Table of Contents
In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each drug, we obtain FDA approval of the manufacturing facilities for any drug we sell, including those of
companies who manufacture our drugs for us. All of these facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. The FDA must also approve foreign
establishments that manufacture products to be sold in the United States and these facilities are subject to periodic regulatory inspection. Our manufacturing
facilities located in California, including our San Dimas facilities, also must be licensed by the State of California in compliance with local regulatory requirements. Our
manufacturing facilities located in Canada, including our Edmonton, Alberta facility, and our facilities located near Dublin and in Cork, Ireland, also must obtain local
licenses and permits in compliance with local regulatory requirements.
Drugs that treat serious or life threatening diseases and conditions that are not adequately addressed by existing drugs, and for which the development
program is designed to address the unmet medical need, may be designated as fast track candidates by the FDA and may be eligible for accelerated and priority
review. Drugs for the treatment of HIV infection that are designated for use under the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief may also qualify for an
expedited or priority review. Viread, Truvada and Atripla received accelerated approval and priority reviews. Drugs receiving accelerated approval must be monitored
in post-marketing clinical trials in order to confirm the safety and benefits of the drug.
Drugs are also subject to extensive regulation outside of the United States. In the European Union, there is a centralized approval procedure that authorizes
marketing of a product in all countries of the European Union (which includes most major countries in Europe). If this centralized approval procedure is not used,
approval in one country of the European Union can be used to obtain approval in another country of the European Union under one of two simplified application
processes: the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure, both of which rely on the principle of mutual recognition. After receiving regulatory
approval through any of the European registration procedures, separate pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required in most countries.
Pricing and Reimbursement
Successful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of governmental and third-party payer reimbursement for the cost of such
products and related treatments. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally provide reimbursement. In
the United States, the European Union and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and
third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and
therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. In addition, changes from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and
governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and health care reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general may adversely
affect our product revenues and profitability.
Legislative and regulatory changes to government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently in the United States.
There have been significant changes to the federal Medicare system in recent years in the United States that could impact the pricing of our products. Under the
Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, Medicare beneficiaries are able to elect coverage for prescription drugs under Medicare
Part D. The prescription drug program began on January 1, 2006 and although we have benefited from patients transitioning from Medicaid to Medicare Part D since
2006, the longer term impact of Medicare Part D on our business is not clear, and the impact will depend in part on specific decisions regarding the level of coverage
provided for the therapeutic categories in which our products are included, the terms on which such coverage is provided, and the extent to which preference is given
to selected products in a category. Third-party payers providing Medicare Part D coverage have attempted to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical
manufacturers. In addition, discussions are taking place at the federal level to pass legislation that would either allow or require the federal government to directly
negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers or set minimum requirements for Medicare pricing. The
24Table of Contents
increasing pressure to lower prescription drug prices may limit drug access for Medicare Part D enrollees. Further, Medicare patients have to pay co-insurance, which
may influence which products are recommended by physicians and selected by patients. In addition to federal Medicare proposals, state Medicaid drug payment
changes could also lower payment for our products. To the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow Medicaid coverage and payment
developments, the adverse effects may be magnified by private insurers adopting lower payment schedules.
In Europe, the success of our commercialized products, and any other product candidates we may develop, will depend largely on obtaining and maintaining
government reimbursement, because in many European countries patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. In
addition, negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization by 12 months or more. Reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability
to sell our products on a profitable basis. In many international markets, governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals, including through the
implementation of reference pricing, price cuts, rebates, revenue-related taxes and profit control, and they expect prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline
over the life of the product or as volumes increase. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on our
products, and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced
by many countries in the European Union. For example, in June 2010, Spain imposed an incremental discount on all branded drugs and in August 2010, Germany
increased the rebate on prescription pharmaceuticals. Other countries have recently imposed or could impose similar discounts on our products. As generic drugs
come to market, we may face price decreases for our products in some countries in the European Union.
Government agencies also issue regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. In addition, from time to time, professional societies,
practice management groups, private health/science foundations and organizations publish guidelines or recommendations directed to certain health care and patient
communities. Such recommendations and guidelines may relate to such matters as product usage, dosage, route of administration, and use of related or competing
therapies and can consequently result in increased or decreased usage of our products. For example, recent HIV treatment guidelines in the United States and abroad
have endorsed earlier diagnosis and treatment.
United States Healthcare Reform
In March 2010, healthcare reform legislation was adopted in the United States. As a result, we are required to further rebate or discount products reimbursed or
paid for by various public payers, including Medicaid and other entities eligible to purchase discounted products through the 340B Drug Pricing Program under the
Public Health Service Act, such as AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs). The discounts, rebates and fees in the legislation that impacted us include:
• effective January 1, 2010, our minimum base rebate amount owed to Medicaid on products reimbursed by Medicaid was increased by 8%, and the
discounts or rebates we owe to ADAPs and other Public Health Service entities which reimburse or purchase our products were also increased by 8%;
• effective March 23, 2010, we are required to extend rebates to patients receiving our products through Medicaid managed care organizations;
• effective January 1, 2011, we are required to provide a 50% discount on products sold to patients while they are in the Medicare Part D “donut hole;”
and
• effective 2011, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of a new industry fee (also
known as the pharmaceutical excise tax), calculated based on select government sales during the 2010 calendar year as a percentage of total industry
government sales.
25Table of Contents
Starting in 2014, as the number of people with access to healthcare coverage is expected to increase, we could experience a positive impact on the sales of our
products. Further, the expansion of healthcare coverage may decrease the reliance of patients on state ADAPs that currently rely on the availability of federal and
state funding.
The full impact of healthcare reform for 2010 was a reduction of approximately $200 million in U.S. net product sales. The majority of this impact began in the
third quarter and continued throughout the fourth quarter of 2010 since some of the new discount and rebate requirements took two quarters to fully take effect. For
2011, excluding the impact of the new pharmaceutical excise tax, we estimate that the impact of healthcare reform on product sales will be approximately 5–6% of our
U.S. net product sales.
Many of the specific determinations necessary to implement the healthcare reform legislation have yet to be decided and communicated by the federal
government. For example, we do not know how many or how quickly patients receiving our product under the Medicare Part D program will reach the “donut hole” or
how details of the pharmaceutical excise tax will be calculated. Based on the information that we have to date, we estimate the 2011 impact of the pharmaceutical
excise tax to be between $30-50 million, which will be classified as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense. The excise tax is not tax deductible. In
calculating the anticipated financial impacts of healthcare reform described above, we made several estimates and assumptions with respect to our expected payer mix
and how the reforms will be implemented.
Health Care Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback
laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business,
including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the increasing attention being given to them by law
enforcement authorities, it is possible that certain of our practices may be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claims laws prohibit anyone from
knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid), claims for reimbursed drugs or
services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our sales and
marketing activities may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including
fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as the possibility of exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). If the government were
to allege against or convict us of violating these laws, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Compulsory Licenses
In a number of developing countries, government officials and other interested groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs for
HIV infection available at low cost. Alternatively, governments in those developing countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to
manufacture and sell their own versions of our products, thereby reducing our product sales. For example, in the past, certain offices of the government of Brazil have
expressed concern over the affordability of our HIV products and declared that they were considering issuing compulsory licenses to permit the manufacture of
otherwise patented products for HIV infection, including Viread. In July 2009, the Brazilian patent authority rejected our patent application for tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viread. This was the highest level of appeal available to us within the Brazilian patent authority. We have filed a civil
action in Brazilian federal court to further appeal the action of the Brazilian patent authority. If we are unable to successfully appeal the decision by the patent
authority in the courts, the Brazilian government would likely purchase generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which would significantly reduce our sales of HIV
products in Brazil. In 2010, the Brazilian government purchased approximately $50 million of our HIV products. We are aware of applications from two generic
companies to sell a generic version of Viread in Brazil. If one or both of
26Table of Contents
these generic applicants are able to compete for this contract for 2011, we would not expect the Brazilian government to purchase any of our HIV products in 2011.
In addition, concerns over the cost and availability of Tamiflu related to a potential avian flu and H1N1 influenza pandemic have generated international
discussions over compulsory licensing of our Tamiflu patents. For example, the Canadian government may allow Canadian manufacturers to manufacture
and export the active ingredient in Tamiflu to eligible developing and least developed countries under Canada’s Access to Medicines Regime. Furthermore, Roche
has issued voluntary licenses to permit third-party manufacturing of Tamiflu. For example, Roche has granted a sublicense to Shanghai Pharmaceutical (Group) Co.,
Ltd. for China and a sublicense to India’s Hetero Drugs Limited for India and certain developing countries. Should one or more compulsory licenses be issued
permitting generic manufacturing to override our Tamiflu patents, or should Roche issue additional voluntary licenses to permit third-party manufacturing of Tamiflu,
those developments could reduce royalties we receive from Roche’s sales of Tamiflu. Certain countries do not permit enforcement of our patents, and third-party
manufacturers are able to sell generic versions of our products in those countries. Compulsory licenses or sales of generic versions of our products could
significantly reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if generic versions of our products are imported into territories where we
have existing commercial sales.
Employees
As of January 31, 2011, we had approximately 4,000 full-time employees. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
Environment, Health and Safety
We seek to comply with all applicable statutory and administrative requirements concerning environmental quality and worker health and safety. We have
made, and will continue to make, expenditures for environmental compliance and protection. Such expenditures have not had, and are not expected to have, a material
effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
We are voluntarily assessing our greenhouse gas emissions, and have begun to take action to reduce such emissions, for example through establishing
employee commuter programs and evaluating the energy efficiency of our buildings. Various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration
to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the California Air Resources Board is in the process of drafting
regulations to meet state emissions targets. Based on current information and subject to the finalization of the proposed regulations, we believe that our primary risk
related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs. However, because we are not an energy intensive business, we do not anticipate being subject to a
cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that would likely be material to our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
We are also subject to other federal, state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment. We use hazardous materials,
chemicals, viruses and various radioactive compounds in our R&D activities and cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials.
Certain misuse or accidents involving these materials could lead to significant litigation, fines and penalties.
Other Information
We are subject to the information requirements of the Exchange Act. Therefore, we file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC.
Such reports, proxy statements and other information may be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A
manifestation of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We note these factors
for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and, therefore, you should
not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.
A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales of our HIV products, particularly Atripla and Truvada. If we are unable to maintain or continue
increasing sales of these products, our results of operations may be adversely affected.
We are currently dependent on sales of our products for the treatment of HIV infection, particularly Atripla and Truvada, to support our existing operations.
Our HIV products contain tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and/or emtricitabine, which belong to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. Were the treatment
paradigm for HIV to change, causing nucleoside-based therapeutics to fall out of favor, or if we were unable to continue increasing our HIV product sales, our results
of operations would likely suffer and we would likely need to scale back our operations, including our spending on research and development (R&D) efforts. For the
year ended December 31, 2010, Atripla and Truvada product sales together were $5.58 billion, or 70% of our total revenues. We may not be able to sustain the growth
rate of sales of our HIV products, especially Atripla and Truvada, for any number of reasons including, but not limited to, the following:
• As our HIV products are used over a longer period of time in many patients and in combination with other products, and additional studies are
conducted, new issues with respect to safety, resistance and interactions with other drugs may arise, which could cause us to provide additional
warnings or contraindications on our labels, narrow our approved indications or halt sales of a product, each of which could reduce our revenues.
• As our HIV products mature, private insurers and government reimbursers often reduce the amount they will reimburse patients for these products,
which increases pressure on us to reduce prices.
• A large part of the market for our HIV products consists of patients who are already taking other HIV drugs. If we are not successful in encouraging
physicians to change patients’ regimens to include our HIV products, the sales of our HIV products will be limited.
• As generic HIV products are introduced into major markets, our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected.
If we fail to commercialize new products or expand the indications for existing products, our prospects for future revenues may be adversely affected.
If we do not introduce new products to market or increase sales of our existing products, we will not be able to increase or maintain our total revenues and
continue to expand our R&D efforts. Drug development is inherently risky and many product candidates fail during the drug development process. For example, in
April 2010, we announced our decision to terminate our Phase 2b clinical trial of GS 9450 for the treatment of chronic
28Table of Contents
hepatitis C. In January 2011, we announced our decision to terminate our Phase 3 clinical trial of ambrisentan in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In
addition, in January 2011, we received a “refuse to file” notification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding our new drug application (NDA) for
the single-tablet regimen of Truvada and Tibotec Pharmaceuticals’ investigational TMC278 for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. The FDA requested
additional information with respect to the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls section of the NDA. In February 2011, we re-filed our new drug application, which
included the requested information, and are awaiting the FDA’s response as to whether it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA remains
unsatisfied with the completeness of our application, our NDA may not be approved or our timeline for obtaining regulatory approval for the product, if granted, may
be further delayed.
A portion of our pre-tax income is derived from royalty revenue recognized from sales of Tamiflu by Roche. If sales of Tamiflu were to decrease, our pre-tax income
will be disproportionately and adversely affected.
F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) markets Tamiflu worldwide for the treatment and prevention of influenza under a
royalty-paying collaborative agreement with us. We recognized $386.5 million in royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 related to royalties received
from sales of Tamiflu by Roche. Although such royalty revenue represented approximately 5% of our total revenues in 2010, it represented approximately 10% of our
pre-tax income during the period. Roche’s Tamiflu sales have unpredictable variability due to their strong relationship with global pandemic planning efforts. Tamiflu
royalties increased sharply in 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 primarily as a result of pandemic planning initiatives worldwide. Tamiflu royalties declined sharply in
the second quarter of 2010 due to the fulfillment of many of the existing pandemic orders from governments and corporations. Based on Roche’s reported sales of
Tamiflu for the three months ended December 31, 2010, we expect Tamiflu royalties to be approximately $13.3 million in the first quarter of 2011. We recognize royalties
on Tamiflu sales by Roche in the quarter following the quarter in which Tamiflu is sold. As sales of Tamiflu decrease, our royalty revenues will decrease and our pre-
tax income will decrease disproportionately. Any such decrease could be material and could adversely impact our operating results.
Our results of operations will be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reforms.
Legislative and regulatory changes to government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement programs occur relatively frequently in the United States
and foreign jurisdictions. In March 2010, healthcare reform legislation was adopted in the United States. As a result, we are required to further rebate or discount
products reimbursed or paid for by various public payers, including Medicaid and other entities eligible to purchase discounted products through the 340B Drug
Pricing Program under the Public Health Service Act, such as ADAPs. The discounts, rebates and fees in the legislation that impacted us include:
• effective January 1, 2010, our minimum base rebate amount owed to Medicaid on products reimbursed by Medicaid has been increased by 8%, and the
discounts or rebates we owe to ADAPs and other Public Health Service entities which reimburse or purchase our products have also been increased by
8%;
• effective March 23, 2010, we are required to extend rebates to patients receiving our products through Medicaid managed care organizations;
• effective January 1, 2011, we are required to provide a 50% discount on products sold to patients while they are in the Medicare Part D “donut hole;”
and
• effective 2011, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of a new industry fee (also
known as the pharmaceutical excise tax), calculated based on select government sales during the 2010 calendar year as a percentage of total industry
government sales.
For 2011, excluding the impact of the new pharmaceutical excise tax, we estimate that the impact of healthcare reform on product sales will be approximately 5–
6% of our U.S. net product sales.
29Table of Contents
Many of the specific determinations necessary to implement the healthcare reform legislation have yet to be decided and communicated by the federal
government. For example, we do not know how many or how quickly patients receiving our product under the Medicare Part D program will reach the “donut hole” or
how details of the pharmaceutical excise tax will be calculated and reflected in our financial results. Based on the information that we have to date, we estimate the
2011 impact of the pharmaceutical excise tax to be between $30-50 million, which will be classified as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense. The excise
tax is not tax deductible. In calculating the anticipated financial impacts of healthcare reform described above, we made several estimates and assumptions with
respect to our expected payer mix and how the reforms will be implemented.
Further, even though not addressed in the healthcare reform legislation, discussions continue at the federal level on legislation that would either allow or
require the federal government to directly negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers or set minimum requirements for Medicare Part D pricing.
In addition, state Medicaid programs could request additional supplemental rebates on our products as a result of the increase in the federal base Medicaid
rebate. Private insurers could also use the enactment of these increased rebates to exert pricing pressure on our products, and to the extent that private insurers or
managed care programs follow Medicaid coverage and payment developments, the adverse effects may be magnified by private insurers adopting lower payment
schedules.
Our existing products are subject to reimbursement from government agencies and other third parties. Pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement pressures
may reduce profitability.
Successful commercialization of our products depends, in part, on the availability of governmental and third-party payer reimbursement for the cost of such
products and related treatments. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally provide reimbursement. In
the United States, the European Union and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products and product candidates, government authorities and
third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and
therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. For example, a significant portion of our sales of the majority of our products are subject to significant
discounts from list price and rebate obligations. In addition, state ADAPs, which purchase a significant portion of our HIV products, rely on federal, supplemental
federal and state funding to help fund purchases of our products. If federal and state funds are not available in amounts sufficient to support the number of patients
that rely on ADAPs, as one state is currently experiencing, sales of our HIV products could be negatively impacted which would reduce our revenues. Further, the
increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put
additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our product sales and profitability. These pressures can arise from
rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform,
pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.
In Europe, the success of our commercialized products, and any other product candidates we may develop, will depend largely on obtaining and maintaining
government reimbursement, because in many European countries patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. In
addition, negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization by 12 months or more. Reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability
to sell our products on a profitable basis. In many international markets, governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals, including through the
implementation of reference pricing, price cuts, rebates, revenue-related taxes and profit control, and they expect prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline
over the life of the product or as volumes increase.
Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on our products, and these efforts could continue as
countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union.
For example, in
30Table of Contents
June 2010, Spain imposed an incremental discount on all branded drugs and in August 2010, Germany increased the rebate on prescription pharmaceuticals. Other
countries have recently imposed or could impose similar discounts on our products. As generic drugs come to market, we may face price decreases for our products
in some countries in the European Union.
Approximately 44% of our product sales occur outside the United States, and currency fluctuations and hedging expenses may cause our earnings to fluctuate,
which could adversely affect our stock price.
Because a significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, we face exposure to adverse movements in
foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign
currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative value of such sales increases. Overall, we are a net receiver of
foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we
transact significant amounts of business.
We use foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales, primarily those denominated in
the Euro. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency
fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. We cannot predict future fluctuations in the foreign currency
exchange rate of the U.S. dollar. If the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly against certain currencies and our hedging program does not sufficiently offset the effects
of such appreciation, our results of operations will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.
Additionally, the expenses that we recognize in relation to our hedging activities can also cause our earnings to fluctuate. The level of hedging expenses that
we recognize in a particular period is impacted by the changes in interest rate spreads between the foreign currencies that we hedge and the U.S. dollar.
Our inability to accurately estimate demand for our products, as well as sales fluctuations as a result of inventory levels held by wholesalers, pharmacies and non-
retail customers make it difficult for us to accurately forecast sales and may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our financial results and
our stock price.
In 2010, approximately 82% of our product sales in the United States were to three wholesalers, Cardinal Health, Inc., McKesson Corp. and AmerisourceBergen
Corp. The U.S. wholesalers with whom we have entered into inventory management agreements make estimates to determine end user demand and may not be
completely effective in matching their inventory levels to actual end user demand. As a result, changes in inventory levels held by those wholesalers can cause our
operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sales to these wholesalers do not match end user demand. In addition, inventory is held at retail pharmacies and
other non-wholesale locations with whom we have no inventory management agreements and no control over buying patterns. Adverse changes in economic
conditions or other factors may cause retail pharmacies to reduce their inventories of our products, which would reduce their orders from wholesalers and,
consequently, the wholesalers’ orders from us, even if end user demand has not changed. For example, during the second quarter of 2009, the wholesalers increased
their inventory levels for Atripla and Truvada, while inventory levels for Viread decreased. In the third quarter of 2009, the wholesalers drew down on their inventory
such that inventory levels for Atripla and Truvada at the end of the third quarter of 2009 were more consistent with the levels held during the first quarter of 2009. As
inventory in the distribution channel fluctuates from quarter to quarter, we may continue to see fluctuations in our earnings and a mismatch between prescription
demand for our products and our revenues.
In addition, the non-retail sector in the United States, which includes government institutions, including state ADAPs, correctional facilities and large health
maintenance organizations, tends to be even less consistent
31Table of Contents
in terms of buying patterns and often causes quarter over quarter fluctuations that do not necessarily mirror patient demand. For example, in the first quarter of 2010,
non-retail purchases, driven by certain state ADAPs, were lower as a percentage of their federal ADAP fiscal year purchases compared to the first quarters of 2008
and 2009. We believe this decrease was driven by higher purchasing patterns observed during the last three quarters of 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008.
The annual grant cycles for federal and state ADAP funds may cause ADAP purchasing patterns to not reflect patient demand, and we expect to continue to
experience fluctuations in the purchasing patterns of our non-retail customers which may result in fluctuations in our product sales, revenues and earnings in the
future.
In light of the global economic downturn and budget crises faced by many Europe countries, we have observed variations in purchasing patterns induced by
cost containment measures in Europe. We believe these measures have caused some purchasers to reduce inventory of our products in the distribution channels,
and in some cases, even at the patient level, which has decreased our revenues and caused fluctuations in our product sales and earnings. We may continue to see
this trend in the future.
We face significant competition.
We face significant competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, most of whom have substantially greater resources than we do. In
addition, our competitors have more products and have operated in the fields in which we compete for longer than we have. Our HIV products compete primarily with
products from the joint venture established by GSK and Pfizer which markets fixed-dose combination products that compete with Atripla and Truvada.
For example, lamivudine, marketed by this joint venture, is competitive with emtricitabine, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Emtriva and a component of
both Atripla and Truvada. In May 2010, the compound patent covering Epivir (lamivudine) itself expired in the United States and we expect to see generic lamivudine
in the United States in the near future. Generic lamivudine has been available in Spain since March 2010. We expect that generic versions of lamivudine will be
launched in other countries within the European Union as early as the first quarter of 2011.
For Hepsera and Viread for treatment of chronic hepatitis B, we compete primarily with products produced by GSK, BMS and Novartis Pharmaceuticals
Corporation (Novartis) in the United States, the European Union and China. For AmBisome, we compete primarily with products produced by Merck and Pfizer. In
addition, we are aware of at least two lipid formulations that claim similarity to AmBisome becoming available outside of the United States, including the possible
entry of one such formulation in Greece. These formulations may reduce market demand for AmBisome. Furthermore, the manufacture of lipid formulations of
amphotericin B is very complex and if any of these formulations are found to be unsafe, sales of AmBisome may be negatively impacted by association. Letairis
competes directly with a product produced by Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (Actelion) and indirectly with pulmonary arterial hypertension products from United
Therapeutics Corporation and Pfizer. Ranexa competes predominantly with generic compounds from three distinct classes of drugs, beta-blockers, calcium channel
blockers and long-acting nitrates for the treatment of chronic angina in the United States. Cayston competes with a product marketed by Novartis. Tamiflu competes
with products sold by GSK and generic competitors.
In addition, a number of companies are pursuing the development of technologies which are competitive with our existing products or research programs.
These competing companies include specialized pharmaceutical firms and large pharmaceutical companies acting either independently or together with other
pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent
protection and may establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs.

If significant safety issues arise for our marketed products or our product candidates, our future sales may be reduced, which would adversely affect our results of
operations.
The data supporting the marketing approvals for our products and forming the basis for the safety warnings in our product labels were obtained in controlled
clinical trials of limited duration and, in some cases, from post-approval use. As our products are used over longer periods of time by many patients with underlying
health problems, taking numerous other medicines, we expect to continue to find new issues such as safety, resistance or drug interaction issues, which may require
us to provide additional warnings or contraindications on our labels or narrow our approved indications, each of which could reduce the market acceptance of these
products.
Our product Letairis, which was approved by the FDA in June 2007, is a member of a class of compounds called endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) which
pose specific risks, including serious risks of liver injury and birth defects. Because of these risks, Letairis is available only through the Letairis Education and
Access Program (LEAP), a restricted distribution program intended to help physicians and patients learn about the risks associated with the product and assure
appropriate use of the product. As the product is used by additional patients, we may discover new risks associated with Letairis which may result in changes to the
distribution program and additional restrictions on the use of Letairis which may decrease demand for the product.
If serious safety, resistance or drug interaction issues arise with our marketed products, sales of these products could be limited or halted by us or by
regulatory authorities and our results of operations would be adversely affected.
Our operations depend on compliance with complex FDA and comparable international regulations. Failure to obtain broad approvals on a timely basis or to
maintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our products.
The products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authorities and, once approved, are subject to extensive regulation by the
FDA, the European Medicines Agency and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries. We are continuing clinical trials for Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Hepsera,
Emtriva, AmBisome, Letairis, Ranexa and Cayston for currently approved and additional uses. We anticipate that we will file for marketing approval in additional
countries and for additional indications and products over the next several years. These products may fail to receive such marketing approvals on a timely basis, or at
all.
Further, our marketed products and how we manufacture and sell these products are subject to extensive regulation and review. Discovery of previously
unknown problems with our marketed products or problems with our manufacturing or promotional activities may result in restrictions on our products, including
withdrawal of the products from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we could be subject to penalties including fines,
suspensions of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products and criminal prosecution. For example, on September 24, 2010, our San Dimas manufacturing
facility received a Warning Letter from the FDA. See the Risk Factor entitled “Manufacturing problems could delay product shipments and regulatory approvals,
which may adversely affect our results of operations.”
On September 27, 2007, President Bush signed into law the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, which significantly expanded the FDA’s
authority, including, among other things, to:
• require sponsors of marketed products to conduct post-approval clinical studies to assess a known serious risk, signals of serious risk or to identify an
unexpected serious risk;
• mandate labeling changes to products, at any point in a product’s lifecycle, based on new safety information; and
• require sponsors to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy for a product which could include a medication guide, patient package insert, a
communication plan to healthcare providers or
33Table of Contents
other elements as the FDA deems are necessary to assure safe use of the drug, which could include imposing certain restrictions on distribution or use
of a product.
Failure to comply with these or other requirements, if imposed on a sponsor by the FDA, could result in significant civil monetary penalties and our operating
results may be adversely affected.
The results and anticipated timelines of our clinical trials are uncertain and may not support continued development of a product pipeline, which would adversely
affect our prospects for future revenue growth.
We are required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of products that we develop for each intended use through extensive preclinical studies and clinical
trials. The results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large-scale clinical trials. Even successfully completed
large-scale clinical trials may not result in marketable products. If any of our product candidates fails to achieve its primary endpoint in clinical trials, if safety issues
arise or if the results from our clinical trials are otherwise inadequate to support regulatory approval of our product candidates, commercialization of that product
candidate could be delayed or halted. For example, in April 2010, we announced our decision to terminate our Phase 2b clinical trial of GS 9450 for the treatment of
chronic hepatitis C. In addition, we may also face challenges in clinical trial protocol design. If the clinical trials for any of the product candidates in our pipeline are
delayed or terminated, our prospects for future revenue growth would be adversely impacted. For example, we face numerous risks and uncertainties with our product
candidates, including elvitegravir, our novel HIV integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection; and the fixed-dose regimen of elvitegravir, cobicistat and
Truvada for the treatment of HIV in treatment-naïve patients; each currently in Phase 3 clinical trials that could prevent completion of development of these product
candidates. These risks include our ability to enroll patients in clinical trials, the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials, the need to modify or delay our
clinical trials or to perform additional trials and the risk of failing to obtain FDA and other regulatory body approvals. As a result, our product candidates may never
be successfully commercialized. Further, we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of our product candidates if, for example, we believe
commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline. If these programs and others in our pipeline cannot be completed on a timely basis or
at all, then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted. In addition, clinical trials involving our commercial products could raise new safety
issues for our existing products, which could in turn decrease our revenues and harm our business.
Due to our reliance on third-party contract research organizations to conduct our clinical trials, we are unable to directly control the timing, conduct, expense and
quality of our clinical trials.
We extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. We rely on independent third-
party contract research organizations (CROs) to perform most of our clinical studies, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation,
pre-study visits, training, program management and bioanalytical analysis. Many important aspects of the services performed for us by the CROs are out of our direct
control. If there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our CROs, our clinical trials may be delayed. Moreover, in our regulatory submissions, we rely on
the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third-party CROs. If any of our CROs’ processes, methodologies or results were determined to be invalid or
inadequate, our own clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals could be adversely impacted.
We depend on relationships with other companies for sales and marketing performance and revenues. Failure to maintain these relationships, poor performance
by these companies or disputes with these companies could negatively impact our business.
We rely on a number of significant collaborative relationships with major pharmaceutical companies for our sales and marketing performance in certain
territories. These include collaborations with BMS for Atripla in the United States, Europe and Canada; Roche for Tamiflu worldwide; and GSK for ambrisentan in
territories outside
34Table of Contents
of the United States. In some countries, we rely on international distributors for sales of Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva and AmBisome. Some of these
relationships also involve the clinical development of these products by our partners. Reliance on collaborative relationships poses a number of risks, including the
risk that:
• we are unable to control the resources our corporate partners devote to our programs or products;
• disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of rights to technology developed with our corporate partners;
• disagreements with our corporate partners could cause delays in, or termination of, the research, development or commercialization of product
candidates or result in litigation or arbitration;
• contracts with our corporate partners may fail to provide significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if one of these partners fails to
perform;
• our corporate partners have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional products and may pursue
alternative technologies or products either on their own or in collaboration with our competitors;
• our corporate partners with marketing rights may choose to pursue competing technologies or to devote fewer resources to the marketing of our
products than they do to products of their own development; and
• our distributors and our corporate partners may be unable to pay us, particularly in light of current economic conditions.
Given these risks, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. If these efforts fail, our product
development or commercialization of new products could be delayed or revenues from products could decline.
Under our April 2002 licensing agreement with GSK, we gave GSK the right to control clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of Hepsera in
territories in Asia, Africa and Latin America. These include major markets for Hepsera, such as China, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. In November 2009, we entered
into an agreement with GSK that provided GSK with exclusive commercialization rights and registration responsibilities for Viread for the treatment of chronic
hepatitis B in China. In October 2010, we granted similar rights to GSK in Japan and Saudi Arabia. The success of Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic
hepatitis B in these territories depends almost entirely on the efforts of GSK. In this regard, GSK promotes Epivir-HBV/Zeffix, a product that competes with Hepsera
and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Consequently, GSK’s marketing strategy for Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B may be
influenced by its promotion of Epivir-HBV/Zeffix. We receive royalties from GSK equal to a percentage of GSK’s net sales of Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of
chronic hepatitis B as well as net sales of GSK’s Epivir-HBV/Zeffix. If GSK fails to devote sufficient resources to, or does not succeed in developing or
commercializing Hepsera or Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in its territories, our potential revenues in these territories may be substantially reduced.
In addition, Cayston and Letairis are distributed through third-party specialty pharmacies, which are pharmacies specializing in the dispensing of medications
for complex or chronic conditions that may require a high level of patient education and ongoing counseling. The use of specialty pharmacies requires significant
coordination with our sales and marketing, medical affairs, regulatory affairs, legal and finance organizations and involves risks, including but not limited to risks that
these specialty pharmacies will:
• not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, patient data or safety complaints;
• not effectively sell or support Cayston or Letairis;
• not devote the resources necessary to sell Cayston or Letairis in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;
35Table of Contents
• not be able to satisfy their financial obligations to us or others; or
• cease operations.
We also rely on a third party to administer LEAP, the restricted distribution program designed to support Letairis. This third party provides information and
education to prescribers and patients on the risks of Letairis, confirms insurance coverage and investigates alternative sources of reimbursement or assistance,
ensures fulfillment of the risk management requirements mandated for Letairis by the FDA and coordinates and controls dispensing to patients through the third-
party specialty pharmacies. Failure of this third party or the specialty pharmacies that distribute Letairis to perform as expected may result in regulatory action from
the FDA or decreased Letairis sales, either of which would harm our business.
Further, Cayston may only be taken by patients using a specific inhalation device that delivers the drug to the lungs of patients. Our ongoing distribution of
Cayston is entirely reliant upon the manufacturer of that device. For example, the manufacturer could encounter other issues with regulatory agencies related to the
device or be unable to supply sufficient quantities of this device. In addition, the manufacturer may not be able to provide adequate warranty support for the device
after it has been distributed to patients. With respect to distribution of the drug and device to patients, we are reliant on the capabilities of specialty pharmacies. For
example, the distribution channel for drug and device is complicated and requires coordination. The reimbursement approval processes associated with both drug
and device are similarly complex. If the device manufacturer is unable to obtain reimbursement approval or receives approval at a lower-than-expected price, sales of
Cayston may be adversely affected. Any of the previously described issues may limit the sales of Cayston, which would adversely affect our financial results.
Expenses associated with clinical trials may cause our earnings to fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price.
The clinical trials required for regulatory approval of our products, as well as clinical trials we are required to conduct after approval, are very expensive. It is
difficult to accurately predict or control the amount or timing of these expenses from quarter to quarter, and the FDA and/or other regulatory agencies may require
more clinical testing than we originally anticipated. Uneven and unexpected spending on these programs may cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to
quarter, and our stock price may decline.
Our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to protect our patents and other intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally.
We may not be able to obtain effective patents to protect our technologies from use by competitors and patents of other companies could require us to stop using or
pay for the use of required technology.
Patents and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. Our success will depend to a significant degree on our ability to:
• obtain patents and licenses to patent rights;
• preserve trade secrets; and
• operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others.
If we have a properly designed and enforceable patent, it can be more difficult for our competitors to use our technology to create competitive products and
more difficult for our competitors to obtain a patent that prevents us from using technology we create. As part of our business strategy, we actively seek patent
protection both in the United States and internationally and file additional patent applications, when appropriate, to cover improvements in our compounds, products
and technology.
We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications and rights to patents related to our compounds, products and technology, but we cannot
be certain that issued patents will be enforceable or provide
36Table of Contents
adequate protection or that pending patent applications will result in issued patents. Patent applications are confidential for a period of time until a patent is issued.
As a result, we may not know if our competitors filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending applications or if we were the first to invent the
technology that is the subject of our patent applications. Competitors may have filed patent applications or received patents and may obtain additional patents and
proprietary rights that block or compete with our products. In addition, if competitors file patent applications covering our technology, we may have to participate in
interference proceedings or litigation to determine the right to a patent. Litigation and interference proceedings are unpredictable and expensive, such that, even if we
are ultimately successful, our results of operations may be adversely affected by such events.
From time to time, certain individuals or entities may challenge our patents. For example, in 2007, the Public Patent Foundation filed requests for re-examination
with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) challenging four of our patents related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which is an active ingredient in
Atripla, Truvada and Viread. The PTO granted these requests and issued non-final rejections for the four patents, which is a step common in a proceeding to initiate
the re-examination process. In 2008, the PTO confirmed the patentability of all four patents.
Although we were successful in responding to the PTO actions in the instance above, similar organizations may still challenge our patents in foreign
jurisdictions. For example, in April 2008, the Brazilian Health Ministry, citing the U.S. patent re-examination proceedings as grounds for rejection, requested that the
Brazilian patent authority issue a decision that is not supportive of our patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in Brazil. In August 2008, an examiner in
the Brazilian patent authority issued a final rejection of our fumarate salt patent application, the only patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate we have filed
in Brazil. We then filed an appeal within the patent authority responding to the questions raised in the rejection. In July 2009, the Brazilian patent authority again
rejected the application. This was the highest level of appeal available to us within the Brazilian patent authority. We have filed a civil action in Brazilian federal court
to further appeal the action of the Brazilian patent authority. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding on our tenofovir disoproxil fumarate patent
application. If we are unsuccessful in our appeal to the courts of the decision by the patent authority, the Brazilian government would likely purchase generic
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which would significantly reduce our sales of HIV products in Brazil. In 2010, the Brazilian government purchased approximately $50
million of our HIV products. We are aware of applications from two generic companies to sell a generic version of Viread in Brazil. If one or both of these generic
applicants are able to compete for this contract for 2011, we would not expect the Brazilian government to purchase any of our HIV products in 2011.
As another example, the Patent Office of India initially allowed our claims covering tenofovir disoproxil and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. However, under
Indian civil procedure, prior to the official grant of the allowed applications, several parties filed legal actions to protest the decision to grant the patents. In August
2009, the Indian Patent Office announced that it had decided these actions against us and would not therefore allow the patents to be granted. We have filed an
appeal within the Indian Patent Office Intellectual Property Appellate Board on both of these applications. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings. If
we are unsuccessful in our appeal of these decisions, any further appeals will have to be pursued in the Indian court system, and may ultimately prove unsuccessful.
In the meantime, any competitor is able to sell generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in India. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in appealing any further negative
decisions by the Indian Patent Office in the Indian courts, these competitors would be able to continue to sell generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which could
reduce the amount of royalties we receive from our Indian generic licenses.
Patents do not cover ranolazine, the active ingredient of Ranexa. Instead, when it was discovered that only a sustained release formulation of ranolazine would
achieve therapeutic plasma levels, patents were obtained on those formulations and the characteristic plasma levels they achieve. Patents do not cover the active
ingredients in AmBisome. In addition, we do not have patent filings in China or certain other Asian countries covering all forms of adefovir dipivoxil, the active
ingredient in Hepsera. Asia is a major market for therapies for hepatitis B, the indication for which Hepsera has been developed.
37Table of Contents
We may obtain patents for certain products many years before marketing approval is obtained for those products. Because patents have a limited life, which
may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of the patent may be limited. However, we may be able to apply for patent
term extensions in some countries.
As part of the approval process of some of our products, the FDA granted an exclusivity period during which other manufacturers’ applications for approval
of generic versions of our product will not be granted. Generic manufacturers often wait to challenge the patents protecting products that have been granted
exclusivity until one year prior to the end of the exclusivity period. From time to time, we have received notices from manufacturers indicating that they intend to
import chemical intermediates possibly for use in making our products. Generic manufacturers have sought and may continue to seek FDA approval for a similar or
identical drug through an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), the application form typically used by manufacturers seeking approval of a generic drug.
For example, in November 2008, we received notice that Teva Pharmaceuticals (Teva) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture
and market a generic version of Truvada. In the notice, Teva alleges that two of the patents associated with emtricitabine are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be
infringed by Teva’s manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Truvada. In December 2008, we filed a lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the two
emtricitabine patents. In March 2009, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic
version of Atripla. In the notice, Teva challenged the same two emtricitabine patents. In May 2009, we filed another lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the two
emtricitabine patents, and this lawsuit was consolidated with the lawsuit filed in December 2008. In January 2010, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA
to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Viread. In the notice, Teva challenged four of the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
patents protecting Viread. In January 2010, we also received notices from Teva amending its ANDAs related to Atripla and Truvada. In the notice related to Truvada,
Teva challenged four patents related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and two additional patents related to emtricitabine. In the notice related to Atripla, Teva
challenged four patents related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, two additional patents related to emtricitabine and two patents related to efavirenz. In March 2010, we
filed a lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the four Viread patents and two additional emtricitabine patents. In March 2010, BMS and Merck filed a lawsuit
against Teva for infringement of the patents related to efavirenz.
In June 2010, we received notice that Lupin Limited (Lupin) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic
version of Ranexa. In the notice, Lupin alleges that ten of the patents associated with Ranexa are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Lupin’s
manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Ranexa. In July 2010, we filed a lawsuit against Lupin for infringement of our patents for Ranexa.
In August 2010, we received notice that Sigmapharm Labs (Sigmapharm) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a
generic version of Hepsera. In the notice, Sigmapharm alleges that both of the patents associated with Hepsera are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed
by Sigmapharm’s manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Hepsera. In September 2010, we filed a lawsuit against Sigmapharm for infringement of our patents
for Hepsera. One of the patents challenged by Sigmapharm is also being challenged by Ranbaxy, Inc. (Ranbaxy) pursuant to a notice received in October 2010. The
patent challenged by Ranbaxy expires in July 2018. We have the option of filing a lawsuit at any time if we believe that Ranbaxy is infringing our patent.
In February 2011, we received notice that Natco Pharma Limited (Natco) submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a
generic version of Tamiflu. In the notice, Natco alleges that a patent associated with Tamiflu is invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Natco’s
manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Tamiflu. We are currently reviewing the notice letter and have 45 days from the date of receipt to commence a patent
infringement lawsuit against Natco.
38Table of Contents
We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, and we may spend significant resources enforcing these patents. If we are unsuccessful in these
lawsuits, some or all of our original claims in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated and the patent protection for Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Ranexa and
Tamiflu in the United States could be substantially shortened. Further, if all of the patents covering those products are invalidated, the FDA could approve the
requests to manufacture a generic version of such products prior to the expiration date of those patents.
Our success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.
If we infringe the patents of others, we may be prevented from commercializing products or may be required to obtain licenses from these third parties. We may
not be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required license on reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain these licenses or alternative technologies, we
may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products. For example, we are aware of a body of patents that may relate to our operation of LEAP, our
restricted distribution program designed to support Letairis.
Furthermore, we use significant proprietary technology and rely on unpatented trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect certain aspects of our
production and other technologies. Our trade secrets may become known or independently discovered by our competitors.
Manufacturing problems could delay product shipments and regulatory approvals, which may adversely affect our results of operations.
We depend on third parties to perform manufacturing activities effectively and on a timely basis for the majority of our solid dose products. In addition, Roche,
either by itself or through third parties, is responsible for manufacturing Tamiflu. The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and
regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. We, our third-party manufacturers and our corporate partners are
subject to current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and
quality standards as defined by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Similar regulations are in effect in other countries.
Our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners are independent entities who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risks which are out
of our control. If we or any of these third-party manufacturers or corporate partners fail to perform as required, this could impair our ability to deliver our products on
a timely basis or receive royalties or cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. To the extent these risks materialize and affect their
performance obligations to us, our financial results may be adversely affected.
Our manufacturing operations are subject to routine inspections by regulatory agencies. For example, in January and February 2010, the FDA conducted a
routine inspection of our San Dimas, California, manufacturing and distribution facility, where we manufacture AmBisome and Cayston, fill and finish Macugen, and
package solid dosage form products. At the conclusion of that inspection, the FDA issued Form 483 Inspectional Observations stating concerns over: the
maintenance of aseptic processing conditions in the manufacturing suite for our AmBisome product; environmental maintenance issues in the San Dimas
warehousing facility; batch sampling; and the timeliness of completion of annual product quality reports. On September 24, 2010, our San Dimas manufacturing
facility received a Warning Letter from the FDA further detailing the FDA’s concerns over the AmBisome manufacturing environment, including control systems and
monitoring, procedures to prevent microbiological contamination and preventative cleaning and equipment maintenance. Referencing certain Viread lots, the letter
also stated concerns connected with quality procedures, controls and investigation procedures, and a generalized concern over the effectiveness of the San Dimas
quality unit in carrying out its responsibilities.
39Table of Contents
In November and December 2010, the FDA re-inspected the San Dimas facility. The re-inspection closed with no additional Form 483 observations.
Consequently, we believe that we have addressed the FDA’s concerns as stated in the Form 483 observations and the Warning Letter, but we are awaiting
confirmation of acceptance from the FDA.
Unless and until we receive confirmation from the FDA that it is satisfied we have corrected outstanding issues, the FDA may withhold permission to export
AmBisome and Cayston manufactured at San Dimas to certain countries outside the United States and Europe. The FDA may also withhold approval of pending drug
applications listing the San Dimas facility. Since, as required, we have notified appropriate international regulatory authorities of the letter’s issuance, it is possible
that the letter may impact our ability to supply our aseptic products manufactured at San Dimas (AmBisome, Cayston and Macugen) outside the United States. If as a
result of a Warning Letter, we are unable to receive export or regulatory approvals for AmBisome or any other products at issue, we may be unable to sell sufficient
quantities of these products to meet market demand, which would decrease our revenues and harm our business. As described further in the risk factor entitled “We
may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell our products, which would limit our ability to generate
revenues” below, we manufacture AmBisome and fill and finish Macugen exclusively at our San Dimas facility.
We do not believe the Warning Letter will impact our ability to supply any of the solid dosage form products that we package at the San Dimas facility, which
include Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Emtriva, Hepsera, Letairis and Ranexa. In the event our solid dosage form products were affected, we have alternate sites from which
we could supply such products.
Our ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize Cayston will depend upon our ability to manufacture in a multi-product facility.
Aztreonam, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Cayston, is a mono-bactam Gram-negative antibiotic. We manufacture Cayston by ourselves in San Dimas,
California, or through third parties, in multi-product manufacturing facilities. Historically, the FDA has permitted the manufacture of mono-bactams in multi-product
manufacturing facilities; however, there can be no assurance that the FDA will continue to allow this practice. We do not currently have a single-product facility that
can be dedicated to the manufacture of Cayston nor have we engaged a contract manufacturer with a single-product facility for Cayston. If the FDA prohibits the
manufacture of mono-bactam antibiotics, like aztreonam, in multi-product manufacturing facilities in the future, we may not be able to procure a single-product
manufacturing facility in a timely manner, which would adversely affect our commercial supplies of Cayston and our anticipated financial results attributable to such
product.
On September 24, 2010, our San Dimas manufacturing facility received a Warning Letter from the FDA. See the Risk Factor entitled “Manufacturing problems
could delay product shipments and regulatory approvals, which may adversely affect our results of operations.” It is possible that the Warning Letter may impact our
ability to supply Cayston manufactured at San Dimas outside of the United States, which would decrease our revenues and harm our business.
We may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell our products, which would limit our ability to
generate revenues.
We need access to certain supplies and products to conduct our clinical trials and to manufacture our products. In light of the global economic downturn, we
have had increased difficulty in purchasing certain of the raw materials used in our manufacturing process. If we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of these
materials or find suitable alternate materials in a timely manner, our development efforts for our product candidates may be delayed or our ability to manufacture our
products would be limited, which would limit our ability to generate revenues.
40Table of Contents
Suppliers of key components and materials must be named in an NDA filed with the FDA for any product candidate for which we are seeking FDA approval,
and significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required. Even after a manufacturer is qualified by the FDA, the manufacturer must continue
to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with GMP. Manufacturers are subject to regular, periodic
inspections by the FDA following initial approval. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that the equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do
not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may suspend the manufacturing operations. If the manufacturing
operations of any of the single suppliers for our products are suspended, we may be unable to generate sufficient quantities of commercial or clinical supplies of
product to meet market demand, which would in turn decrease our revenues and harm our business. In addition, if delivery of material from our suppliers were
interrupted for any reason, we may be unable to ship certain of our products for commercial supply or to supply our products in development for clinical trials. In
addition, some of our products and the materials that we utilize in our operations are made at only one facility. For example, we manufacture AmBisome and fill and
finish Macugen exclusively at our facilities in San Dimas, California. In the event of a disaster, including an earthquake, equipment failure or other difficulty, we may
be unable to replace this manufacturing capacity in a timely manner and may be unable to manufacture AmBisome and Macugen to meet market needs.
Cayston is dependent on two different third-party single-source suppliers. First, aztreonam, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in aztreonam for inhalation
solution, is manufactured by a single supplier at a single site. Second, it is administered to the lungs of patients through a device that is made by a single supplier at a
single site. Disruptions or delays with any of these single suppliers could adversely affect our ability to supply Cayston, and we cannot be sure that alternative
suppliers can be identified in a timely manner, or at all. See the Risk Factor entitled “Our ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize Cayston will depend
upon our ability to manufacture in a multi-product facility.”
In addition, we depend on a single supplier for high quality cholesterol, which is used in the manufacture of AmBisome. We also depend on single suppliers
for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of Vistide, Ranexa and Cayston and for the tableting of Emtriva and Letairis. Astellas US LLC, which markets Lexiscan in the
United States, is responsible for the commercial manufacture and supply of product in the United States and is dependent on a single supplier for the active
pharmaceutical ingredient of Lexiscan. Problems with any of the single suppliers we depend on may negatively impact our development and commercialization efforts.
A significant portion of the raw materials and intermediates used to manufacture our HIV products (Atripla, Truvada, Viread and Emtriva) are supplied by
Chinese-based companies. As a result, an international trade dispute between China and the United States or any other actions by the Chinese government that
would limit or prevent Chinese companies from supplying these materials would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply our HIV products to meet
market needs and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results.
We face credit risks from our European customers that may adversely affect our results of operations.
Our European product sales to government-owned or supported customers in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain are subject to significant payment delays due
to government funding and reimbursement practices. This has resulted and may continue to result in an increase in days sales outstanding due to the average length
of time that we have accounts receivable outstanding. Our accounts receivable in these countries totaled approximately $965.9 million as of December 31, 2010, of
which $428.5 million was more than 120 days past due based on contractual payment terms. As a result of the fiscal and debt crises in these countries, the number of
days our invoices are past due has continued to increase in line with that being experienced by other pharmaceutical companies that are also selling directly to
hospitals. Historically, receivables balances with certain publicly-owned hospitals accumulate over a period of time and are then subsequently settled as large lump
sum payments. If significant changes were to occur in the reimbursement practices of these European governments or if
41Table of Contents
government funding becomes unavailable, we may not be able to collect on amounts due to us from these customers and our results of operations would be
adversely affected. For example, at December 31, 2010, we had $109.1 million due from publicly-owned hospitals in Greece. The Greek government has offered to settle
the majority of their outstanding receivables with zero-coupon bonds, which are expected to trade at a discount to face value, and we have agreed to accept the
bonds. As of December 31, 2010, we received bonds to settle receivables totaling $12.8 million. We anticipate receiving the remaining bonds in full by the end of the
first quarter of 2011. At December 31, 2010, our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate to cover exposure related to the expected discount on these bonds. In
Spain, Italy and Portugal we are actively pursuing collection of the overdue receivables and taking action as necessary to enforce our legal right to payment.
Our revenues and gross margin could be reduced by imports from countries where our products are available at lower prices.
Prices for our products are based on local market economics and competition and sometimes differ from country to country. Our sales in countries with
relatively higher prices may be reduced if products can be imported into those or other countries from lower price markets. There have been cases in which other
pharmaceutical products were sold at steeply discounted prices in the developing world and then re-exported to European countries where they could be re-sold at
much higher prices. If this happens with our products, particularly Truvada and Viread, which we have agreed to make available at substantially reduced prices to 130
countries participating in our Gilead Access Program, or Atripla, which Merck distributes at substantially reduced prices to HIV infected patients in developing
countries under our August 2006 agreement, our revenues would be adversely affected. In addition, we have established partnerships with thirteen Indian generic
manufacturers to distribute high-quality, low-cost generic versions of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to 95 developing world countries, including India. If generic
versions of our medications under these licenses are then re-exported to the United States, Europe or other markets outside of these 95 countries, our revenues would
be adversely affected.
In addition, purchases of our products in countries where our selling prices are relatively low for resale in countries in which our selling prices are relatively
high may adversely impact our revenues and gross margin and may cause our sales to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. For example, in the European Union, we are
required to permit products purchased in one country to be sold in another country. Purchases of our products in countries where our selling prices are relatively low
for resale in countries in which our selling prices are relatively high affect the inventory level held by our wholesalers and can cause the relative sales levels in the
various countries to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and not reflect the actual consumer demand in any given quarter. These quarterly fluctuations may impact our
earnings, which could adversely affect our stock price and harm our business.
Expensive litigation and government investigations may reduce our earnings.
In November 2008, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of
Truvada. In the notice, Teva alleges that two of the patents associated with emtricitabine are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva’s
manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Truvada. In December 2008, we filed a lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents. In
March 2009, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Atripla. In the
notice, Teva challenged the same two emtricitabine patents. In May 2009, we filed another lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents, and
this lawsuit was consolidated with the lawsuit filed in December 2008. In January 2010, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting
permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Viread. In the notice, Teva challenged four of the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate patents protecting Viread.
In January 2010, we also received notices from Teva amending its ANDAs related to Atripla and Truvada. In the notice related to Truvada, Teva challenged four
patents related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and two additional patents related to emtricitabine. In the notice related to Atripla, Teva challenged four
42Table of Contents
patents related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, two additional patents related to emtricitabine and two patents related to efavirenz. In March 2010, we filed a lawsuit
against Teva for infringement of the four Viread patents and two additional emtricitabine patents. In March 2010, BMS and Merck filed a lawsuit against Teva for
infringement of the patents related to efavirenz.
In June 2010, we received notice that Lupin submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Ranexa. In
the notice, Lupin alleges that ten of the patents associated with Ranexa are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Lupin’s manufacture, use or sale of
a generic version of Ranexa. In July 2010, we filed a lawsuit against Lupin for infringement of our patents for Ranexa.
In August 2010, we received notice that Sigmapharm submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of
Hepsera. In the notice, Sigmapharm alleges that both of the patens associated with Hepsera are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Sigmapharm’s
manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Hepsera. In September 2010, we filed a lawsuit against Sigmapharm for infringement of our patents for Hepsera. One
of the patents challenged by Sigmapharm is also being challenged by Ranbaxy pursuant to a notice received in October 2010. The patent challenged by Ranbaxy
expires in July 2018. We are considering our options for enforcing our patent.
In February 2011, we received notice that Natco submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of
Tamiflu. In the notice, Natco alleges that a patent associated with Tamiflu is invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Natco’s manufacture, use or sale of
a generic version of Tamiflu. We are currently reviewing the notice letter and have 45 days from the date of receipt to commence a patent infringement lawsuit against
Natco.
We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, and we may spend significant resources enforcing these patents. If we are unsuccessful in these
lawsuits, some or all of our original claims in the patents may be narrowed or invalidated and the patent protection for Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Ranexa and
Tamiflu in the United States could be substantially shortened. Further, if all of the patents covering those products are invalidated, the FDA could approve the
requests to manufacture a generic version of such products prior to the expiration date of those patents.
The outcome of the lawsuits above, or any other lawsuits that may be brought against us, are inherently uncertain, and adverse developments or outcomes
can result in significant expenses, monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us that could significantly reduce our earnings and cash flows and harm
our business.
In some countries, we may be required to grant compulsory licenses for our products or face generic competition for our products.
In a number of developing countries, government officials and other interested groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs for
HIV infection available at low cost. Alternatively, governments in those developing countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to
manufacture and sell their own versions of our products, thereby reducing our product sales. For example, in the past, certain offices of the government of Brazil have
expressed concern over the affordability of our HIV products and declared that they were considering issuing compulsory licenses to permit the manufacture of
otherwise patented products for HIV infection, including Viread. In July 2009, the Brazilian patent authority rejected our patent application for tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viread. This was the highest level of appeal available to us within the Brazilian patent authority. We have filed a civil
action in Brazilian federal court to further appeal the action of the Brazilian patent authority. If we are unable to successfully appeal the decision by the patent
authority in the courts, the Brazilian government would likely purchase generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which would significantly reduce our sales of HIV
products in
43Table of Contents
Brazil. In 2010, the Brazilian government purchased approximately $50 million of our HIV products. Further, we are aware of applications from two generic companies
to sell a generic version of Viread in Brazil. If one or both of these generic applicants are able to compete for this contract for 2011, we would not expect the Brazilian
government to purchase any of our HIV products in 2011.
In addition, concerns over the cost and availability of Tamiflu related to a potential avian flu pandemic and H1N1 influenza have generated international
discussions over compulsory licensing of our Tamiflu patents. For example, the Canadian government may allow Canadian manufacturers to manufacture
and export the active ingredient in Tamiflu to eligible developing and least developed countries under Canada’s Access to Medicines Regime. Furthermore, Roche
has issued voluntary licenses to permit third-party manufacturing of Tamiflu. For example, Roche has granted a sublicense to Shanghai Pharmaceutical (Group) Co.,
Ltd. for China and a sublicense to India’s Hetero Drugs Limited for India and certain developing countries. Should one or more compulsory licenses be issued
permitting generic manufacturing to override our Tamiflu patents, or should Roche issue additional voluntary licenses to permit third-party manufacturing of Tamiflu,
those developments could reduce royalties we receive from Roche’s sales of Tamiflu. Certain countries do not permit enforcement of our patents, and third-party
manufacturers are able to sell generic versions of our products in those countries. Compulsory licenses or sales of generic versions of our products could
significantly reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations, particularly if generic versions of our products are imported into territories where we
have existing commercial sales.
We may face significant liability resulting from our products that may not be covered by insurance and successful claims could materially reduce our earnings.
The testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our commercial products, as well as product candidates in development, involve substantial risk of product
liability claims. These claims may be made directly by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others. In recent years, coverage and availability
of cost-effective product liability insurance has decreased, so we may be unable to maintain sufficient coverage for product liabilities that may arise. In addition, the
cost to defend lawsuits or pay damages for product liability claims may exceed our coverage. If we are unable to maintain adequate coverage or if claims exceed our
coverage, our financial condition and our ability to clinically test our product candidates and market our products will be adversely impacted. In addition, negative
publicity associated with any claims, regardless of their merit, may decrease the future demand for our products and impair our financial condition.
Business disruptions from natural or man-made disasters may harm our future revenues.
Our worldwide operations could be subject to business interruptions stemming from natural or man-made disasters for which we may be self-insured. Our
corporate headquarters and Palo Alto locations, which together house a majority of our research and development activities, and our San Dimas manufacturing
facility are located in California, a seismically active region. As we do not carry earthquake insurance and significant recovery time could be required to resume
operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.
Changes in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings.
Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax
laws, changes in tax laws and rates, our portion of the non-tax deductible pharmaceutical excise tax that we will be required to pay starting in 2011 as a result of the
enactment of U.S. healthcare reform legislation, the accounting for stock options and other share-based payments, mergers and acquisitions, future levels of R&D
spending, changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre-tax
earnings and resolution of federal, state and foreign income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be
significant and could have a negative impact on our net income.
44Table of Contents
Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the
2005, 2006 and 2007 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant
disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions.
Resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.
Changes in accounting rules or policies may affect our financial position and results of operations.
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and related implementation guidelines and interpretations can be highly complex and involve subjective
judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation, the adoption of new guidance or the application of existing guidance to changes in our business could
significantly affect our financial position and results of operations.
If we fail to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop new product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and
commercialize our product candidates.
Our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as
well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, governmental regulation and commercialization. We face competition for personnel from other companies,
universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field
is intense, and there is a limited pool of qualified potential employees to recruit. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms. If we
are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention efforts, our business may be harmed.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
In November 2008, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of
Truvada. In the notice, Teva alleges that two of the patents associated with emtricitabine, owned by Emory University and licensed exclusively to us, are invalid,
unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva’s manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Truvada. In December 2008, we filed a lawsuit in U.S. District
Court in New York against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents. In March 2009, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA
requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Atripla. In the notice, Teva challenged the same two emtricitabine patents. In May 2009, we
filed another lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New York against Teva for infringement of the two emtricitabine patents, and this lawsuit was consolidated with the
lawsuit filed in December 2008. In January 2010, we received notice that Teva submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a
generic version of Viread. In the notice, Teva challenged four of the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate patents protecting Viread. In January 2010, we also received notices
from Teva amending its ANDAs related to Atripla and Truvada. In the notice related to Truvada, Teva challenged four patents related to tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate and two additional patents related to emtricitabine. In the notice related to Atripla, Teva challenged four patents related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, two
additional patents related to emtricitabine and two patents related to efavirenz. In March 2010, we filed a lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the four Viread
patents and two additional emtricitabine patents. In March 2010, BMS and Merck filed a lawsuit against Teva for infringement of the patents related to efavirenz.
In June 2010, we received notice that Lupin submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of Ranexa. In
the notice, Lupin alleges that ten of the patents associated with Ranexa are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Lupin’s manufacture, use or sale of
a generic version of Ranexa. In July 2010, we filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New Jersey against Lupin for infringement of our patents for Ranexa.
In August 2010, we received notice that Sigmapharm submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of
Hepsera. In the notice, Sigmapharm alleges that both of the patents associated with Hepsera are invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Sigmapharm’s
manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of Hepsera. In September 2010, we filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in New Jersey against Sigmapharm for
infringement of our patents for Hepsera. One of the patents challenged by Sigmapharm is also being challenged by Ranbaxy, Inc. (Ranbaxy) pursuant to a notice
received in October 2010. The patent challenged by Ranbaxy expires in July 2018. We are considering our options for enforcing our patent.
In February 2011, we received notice that Natco submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting permission to manufacture and market a generic version of
Tamiflu. In the notice, Natco alleges that a patent associated with Tamiflu is invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Natco’s manufacture, use or sale of

Natco.
We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these actions, and we may spend significant resources enforcing these patents. If we are unsuccessful in these
lawsuits, some or all of our original claims in the patents may be

narrowed or invalidated and the patent protection for Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Ranexa and Tamiflu in the United States could be substantially shortened.
Further, if all of the patents covering those products are invalidated, the FDA could approve the requests to manufacture a generic version of such products prior to
the expiration date of those patents.

As of February 18, 2011, we had 795,264,644 shares of common stock outstanding held by approximately 466 stockholders of record.
We have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our inception. We currently expect to retain earnings primarily for use in the operation and
expansion of our business, and therefore, do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the near future. In an effort to continue to return value to our stockholders
and minimize dilution from stock issuances, our Board of Directors (Board) authorized a program in January 2010 for the repurchase of our common stock in an
amount of up to $1.00 billion through open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated purchases or other means. We
completed this plan in May 2010, at which time our Board authorized a three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2010, we have
repurchased $3.02 billion of our common stock under this program. In 2010, we utilized a total of $4.02 billion to repurchase and retire 109.9 million shares of our
common stock, at an average purchase price of $36.57 per share.
In January 2011, our Board authorized an additional three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program which will commence upon the completion of our
existing program authorized in May 2010. We intend to use the additional authorization to repurchase our shares from time to time, to offset the dilution created by
shares issued under employee stock plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically. See Item 8, Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our stock repurchase programs.
Performance Graph(1)
The following graph compares our total stockholder returns for the past five years to two indices: the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index, labeled S&P500
Index; and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, labeled NBI Index. The total return for each index assumes the reinvestment of all dividends, if any, paid by companies
included in these indices and are calculated as of December 31 of each year.
We are a composite member of each of the S&P500 Index and the NBI Index, and we intend to use these indices as comparators for our stock performance
for the purposes of the following graph going forward. As a
48Table of Contents
composite member of the S&P500 Index, we are required under applicable regulations to use this index as a comparator, and we believe the NBI Index is a relevant
comparator since it is composed of peer companies in lines-of-business similar to ours.
The stockholder return shown on the graph below is not necessarily indicative of future performance, and we do not make or endorse any predictions as to
future stockholder returns.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
In an effort to continue to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, our Board authorized a program in January 2010 for the
repurchase of our common stock in an amount of up to $1.00 billion through open market and private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately
negotiated purchases or other means. We completed this plan in May 2010, at which time our Board authorized a three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program.
As of December 31, 2010, we have repurchased $3.02 billion of our common stock under this program. In 2010, we utilized a total of $4.02 billion to repurchase and

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand
our results of operations and financial condition. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited Consolidated Financial
Statements and the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (including the
disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk Factors”). Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles and are presented in U.S. dollars.
Management Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet medical need. Our mission is to
advance the care of patients suffering from life threatening diseases worldwide. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North America,
Europe and Asia Pacific. We market products in the HIV/AIDS, liver disease, respiratory and cardiovascular/metabolic therapeutic areas. Our product portfolio is
comprised of Atripla® (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), Truvada® (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate),
Viread® (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and Emtriva® (emtricitabine) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; Hepsera® (adefovir dipivoxil)
and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B; AmBisome® (amphotericin B liposome for injection) for the treatment of severe fungal infections; Letairis®
(ambrisentan) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); Ranexa® (ranolazine) for the treatment of chronic angina; Vistide® (cidofovir injection) for
the treatment of cytomegalovirus infection and Cayston® (aztreonam for inhalation solution) as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in cystic fibrosis (CF)
patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa).
In addition, we also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under royalty-paying collaborative agreements. For example,
F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) markets Tamiflu® (oseltamivir phosphate) for the treatment and prevention of influenza;
GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK) markets Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in certain territories outside of the United States; GSK also markets
Volibris® (ambrisentan) outside of the United States for the treatment of PAH; Astellas Pharma US, Inc. markets AmBisome for the treatment of severe fungal
infections in the United States and Canada; Astellas US LLC markets Lexiscan® (regadenoson) injection in the United States for use as a pharmacologic stress agent
in radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging; Rapidscan Pharma Solutions, Inc. markets Rapiscan (regadenoson) in certain territories outside of the United States for
the inducement of pharmacological stress and/or vasodilation of the coronary vasculature strictly for purposes of diagnosing cardiovascular disease; Menarini
International Operations Luxembourg SA markets Ranexa in certain territories outside of the United States for the treatment of chronic angina; and Japan Tobacco
Inc. (Japan Tobacco) markets Truvada, Viread and Emtriva in Japan.
Business Highlights
During 2010, we grew our business significantly and achieved record total revenues of $7.95 billion while strengthening our product portfolio and pipeline
programs.
Our antiviral franchise, in particular Atripla and Truvada, continued to drive product sales growth both in the United States and within the big five European
Union markets, which are comprised of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Our cardiovascular franchise also delivered strong results for the year
with the contributions of Letairis and Ranexa to our total revenues. Our newest product, Cayston, in the respiratory area, was well accepted in North America and
certain countries of Europe, showing continued revenue growth throughout 2010.
52Table of Contents
During the year, we also made strategic decisions to advance and focus our research and development (R&D) pipeline efforts, including:
• In the HIV area, in September 2010, we announced that we had submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency for
marketing approval of the single-tablet regimen of Truvada and Tibotec Pharmaceuticals’ (Tibotec) investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitor, TMC278 (rilpivirine hydrochloride), for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. In November 2010, we announced that we had submitted a
New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing approval of the single-tablet regimen of Truvada and
Tibotec’s TMC278, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. In January 2011, we received a “refuse to file” notification from the U.S. FDA. In its
communication, the FDA requested additional information with respect to the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls section of the NDA submission.
In February 2011, we re-filed our new drug application, which included the requested information, and are awaiting the FDA’s response as to whether it
is substantially complete to permit a substantive review.
• Also in the HIV area, during 2010, we initiated both Phase 3 clinical studies for our investigational fixed-dose, single-tablet “Quad” regimen of
elvitegravir, cobicistat (formerly GS 9350) and Truvada. The two Phase 3 studies are evaluating the single-tablet fixed-dose regimen versus a standard of
care among HIV-infected treatment-naïve patients. In the second quarter of 2010, we also initiated a Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy, safety and
tolerability of cobicistat, our pharmacoenhancer that is in development as a boosting agent for certain HIV medicines and other antivirals. In September
2010, we released positive 48-week results from two of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical studies in HIV-infected patients. The first were from the study of our
fixed-dose, single-tablet “Quad” regimen of elvitegravir, cobicistat and Truvada versus Atripla. The second were from the study of cobicistat-boosted
atazanavir plus Truvada compared to ritonavir-boosted atazanavir plus Truvada.
• In the liver disease area, our hepatitis C virus (HCV) pipeline now includes seven unique molecules spanning six therapeutic classes with different
mechanisms of action. Five of these compounds are currently in clinical trials, and two are slated to enter human clinical studies in early 2011. In October
2010, we announced data from a Phase 2a study showing that our investigational compounds GS 9190 and GS 9256, used in conjunction with current
standard of care therapies, produced substantial suppression of HCV within 28 days of treatment. Additionally, in October 2010, we announced new
data from the open-label phase of two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials (Studies 102 and 103) evaluating the four-year efficacy of Viread for the treatment of
chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which show that Viread maintains antiviral suppression with no development of resistance through four years
of treatment. Data also show significant “s” antigen loss, a marker of the resolution of chronic HBV infection, in HBeAg-positive patients.
• Also in the liver disease area, in July 2010, John McHutchison, MD, joined Gilead as Senior Vice President, Liver Disease Therapeutics to lead the efforts
to advance discovery and development programs in the liver disease area.
• In the respiratory area, we announced in October 2010 that our head-to-head Phase 3 clinical trial of Cayston versus tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS)
in CF patients with P. aeruginosa achieved its co-primary endpoint of superiority of Cayston to TIS for mean actual change in forced expiratory volume
in one second (FEV1, a measure of lung function) percent predicted across three treatment cycles (six months). Earlier in the year, in February, we
received marketing approval from the FDA for Cayston as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in CF patients with P. aeruginosa.
• In the cardiovascular and metabolic areas, in December 2010, we announced the termination of ARTEMIS-IPF, our Phase 3 study of ambrisentan in
patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This decision follows an interim analysis of unblinded efficacy and safety data by the study’s Data
Monitoring Committee and our review of those data, which did not show evidence of a treatment benefit in the group of patients randomized to receive
ambrisentan.
53Table of Contents
During the year, we also expanded our pipeline through strategic acquisitions. We completed the acquisition of Arresto Biosciences, Inc. (Arresto) in January
2011 for $225 million plus potential future payments based on achievement of certain sales levels. Arresto was a privately-held, development-stage biotechnology
company based in Palo Alto, California, focused on developing antibodies for the potential treatment of fibrotic diseases and cancer. The company’s lead product is
GS 6624 (formerly AB0024), a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the human lysyl oxidase-like-2 (LOXL2) protein. In addition to an ongoing Phase 1
study of GS 6624 in patients with advanced solid tumors, a Phase 1 study is being conducted to evaluate GS 6624 in patients with IPF.
We completed the acquisition of CGI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CGI) in July 2010 for up to $120 million in cash, the majority as an upfront payment and the
remaining based on the achievement of certain clinical development milestones. CGI was a privately-held development stage pharmaceutical company based in
Branford, Connecticut, primarily focused on small molecule chemistry and protein kinase biology. The lead preclinical compound from CGI’s library of proprietary
small molecule kinase inhibitors targets spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and could have unique applications for the treatment of serious inflammatory diseases, including
rheumatoid arthritis.
Financial Highlights
Our operating results for 2010 were led by total product sales of $7.39 billion, an increase of 14% over total product sales of $6.47 billion for 2009. The increase
in product sales was driven primarily by our antiviral franchise (Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva), due mainly to the strong growth in Atripla sales.
Atripla contributed $2.93 billion, or 45%, to our 2010 antiviral product sales. Atripla product sales for 2010 increased 23% from 2009 primarily due to sales volume
growth in the United States and Europe. Truvada product sales for 2010 comprised $2.65 billion, or 41% of 2010 antiviral product sales. Truvada product sales for
2010 increased 6% from 2009 primarily due to sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. Foreign currency exchange had an unfavorable impact of $93.7
million and $79.8 million on our 2010 revenues and pre-tax earnings, respectively, compared to 2009.
Product sales in the United States were driven primarily by our antiviral franchise but also reflected growth in sales of our cardiovascular products. Antiviral
product sales in the United States increased 13% in 2010 compared to 2009, resulting from the continued growth of patient and market share in the United States.
With respect to our cardiovascular franchise, Ranexa sales in the United States were $234.8 million in 2010, reflecting a continued growth in demand as Ranexa
prescriptions have increased by 71% since our acquisition of CV Therapeutics, Inc. (CV Therapeutics) in April 2009. Ranexa sales were $123.1 million in 2009 for the
period subsequent to our acquisition of CV Therapeutics. Furthermore, Letairis sales contributed $240.3 million to 2010 product sales in the United States, reflecting a
31% increase from 2009. Our newest product, Cayston, also contributed $47.5 million during its first year of sales in 2010, the majority of which was in the United
States.
Product sales in Europe were driven by antiviral product sales, which increased 9% in 2010 compared to 2009, due to continued strong growth in demand.
While we saw demand growth for our products in Europe, the effect was partially offset by recent mandatory price reductions in certain European countries and
foreign currency exchange impact from a strengthening U.S. dollar relative to European currencies.
Royalty revenues recognized from our collaborations with corporate partners were $546.0 million for 2010, an increase of $54.2 million or 11% from royalty
revenues of $491.8 million for 2009. Other royalty revenues, which include royalties from GSK for Hepsera, royalties from Astellas for Lexiscan and royalties from
Japan Tobacco for Truvada, contributed to the increase in total royalty revenues, partially offset by Tamiflu royalties from Roche which decreased from $392.7 million
in 2009 to $386.5 million in 2010.
Our R&D and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased by $230.7 million, or 12% for 2010 compared to 2009. The increase was due
primarily to impairment charges related to in-process R&D
54Table of Contents
(IPR&D) assets acquired from CV Therapeutics, higher headcount and expenses to support our expanding commercial activities and clinical studies expenses related
to increased HIV research activities, partially offset by lower R&D expense reimbursement related to our collaboration with Tibotec.
We approved and communicated a plan during the second quarter of 2010 to close our research operations in Durham, North Carolina and consolidate our liver
disease research activities in Foster City, California. We believe this plan will allow our employees to collaborate more effectively and further advance our programs in
the liver disease area. During the year, we incurred a total of $25.0 million of restructuring expenses related to employee severance and facilities-related expenses
under this plan. In December 2010, we closed our operations in Durham. We do not expect to incur any additional significant costs in connection with this plan.
Financing Activity
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $1.41 billion during 2010, driven primarily by our operating cash flows of $2.83 billion and
proceeds of $2.46 billion from the issuance of convertible senior notes, net of issuance costs, partially offset by repurchases of our common stock under our stock
repurchase programs. Under our current three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program authorized in May 2010, we repurchased $3.02 billion of our common stock
through December 31, 2010. In May 2010, we had completed the $1.00 billion stock repurchase program previously authorized in January 2010. For the year, we
utilized a total of $4.02 billion of cash to repurchase and retire 109.9 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $36.57 per share.
Our Board authorized an additional three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program in January 2011 for future repurchases of our outstanding shares of
common stock which will commence upon the completion of our existing program authorized in May 2010. We intend to use the additional authorization to
repurchase our shares from time to time to offset the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically.
We issued $2.50 billion of convertible senior notes in July 2010 in a private placement and purchased convertible note hedges as well as sold warrants for a net
cost of $207.2 million. The cost of the convertible note hedges will be tax deductible over the life of the notes. The convertible note hedges and warrants are intended
to reduce the potential economic dilution upon future conversions of the notes by effectively increasing our conversion prices for the notes. Our interest expense for
2010 increased by $39.3 million compared to 2009, due primarily to increased interest expense related to the notes.
We have used and will continue to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes to repurchase shares of our common stock and repay
existing indebtedness.
Healthcare Reform
In March 2010, healthcare reform legislation was adopted in the United States. As a result, we are required to further rebate or discount products reimbursed or
paid for by various public payers, including Medicaid and other entities eligible to purchase discounted products through the 340B Drug Pricing Program under the
Public Health Service Act, such as AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs). The discounts, rebates and fees in the legislation that impacted us include:
• effective January 1, 2010, our minimum base rebate amount owed to Medicaid on products reimbursed by Medicaid was increased by 8%, and the
discounts or rebates we owe to ADAPs and other Public Health Service entities which reimburse or purchase our products were also increased by 8%;
• effective March 23, 2010, we are required to extend rebates to patients receiving our products through Medicaid managed care organizations;
• effective January 1, 2011, we are required to provide a 50% discount on products sold to patients while they are in the Medicare Part D “donut hole;”
and
55Table of Contents
• effective 2011, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of a new industry fee (also
known as the pharmaceutical excise tax), calculated based on select government sales during the 2010 calendar year as a percentage of total industry
government sales.
Starting in 2014, as the number of people with access to healthcare coverage is expected to increase, we could experience a positive impact on the sales of our
products. Further, the expansion of healthcare coverage may decrease the reliance of patients on state ADAPs that currently rely on the availability of federal and
state funding.
The full impact of healthcare reform for 2010 was a reduction of approximately $200 million in U.S. net product sales. The majority of this impact began in the
third quarter and continued throughout the fourth quarter of 2010 since some of the new discount and rebate requirements took two quarters to fully take effect. For
2011, excluding the impact of the new pharmaceutical excise tax, we estimate that the impact of healthcare reform on product sales will be approximately 5–6% of our
U.S. net product sales.
Many of the specific determinations necessary to implement the healthcare reform legislation have yet to be decided and communicated by the federal
government. For example, we do not know how many or how quickly patients receiving our product under the Medicare Part D program will reach the “donut hole” or
how details of the pharmaceutical excise tax will be calculated. Based on the information that we have to date, we estimate the 2011 impact of the pharmaceutical
excise tax to be between $30–$50 million, which will be classified as SG&A expense. The excise tax is not tax deductible. In calculating the anticipated financial
impacts of healthcare reform described above, we made several estimates and assumptions with respect to our expected payer mix and how the reforms will be
implemented.
2011 Outlook
Our operating objectives for 2011 include increasing the market share of our commercial products, continuing to strengthen our pipeline with internally
developed and/or externally in-licensed or purchased opportunities and strengthening our key alliances. Additionally, we remain committed to returning value to our
shareholders as we continue to repurchase our shares in a disciplined manner throughout the year.
From an R&D standpoint, we will continue to execute on our pipeline development with a particular focus on innovative HIV single-tablet regimens for patients
and progression of HCV molecules into the clinic.
From a commercial standpoint, we have a number of internal and external initiatives intended to promote the continued growth of our franchises. In the HIV
area, we expect to see continued positive impact from the revised U.S. Department of Health and Human Services treatment guidelines that recommend earlier
treatment for patients with HIV. The extension of the Ryan White Treatment Act should provide stable funding for ADAPs in the United States through 2013.
Assuming the timely resolution of the issues with the “refuse to file” notification from the FDA, we expect to launch a single-tablet regimen of Truvada and Tibotec’s
TMC278 in the second half of 2011 which we expect to contribute incremental revenue to our HIV franchise. In February 2011, we re-filed our new drug application,
which included the requested information, and are awaiting the FDA’s response as to whether it is substantially complete to permit a substantive review. In the
hepatitis B virus (HBV) area, we will continue to support educational and promotional activities focused on U.S. Asian communities, highlighting the need to screen,
diagnose and link patients to care. As part of those efforts, in 2010, we expanded our hepatitis B field team in the United States. In the cardiovascular area, we will
continue in our efforts to raise awareness of Gilead in the PAH and cardiology communities and believe this will help grow revenues of Letairis and Ranexa in 2011. In
cystic fibrosis, we intend to expand our field team to further grow our market share for Cayston.
We are mindful that conditions in our current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals. Some of the factors that could affect
our business include: any future changes to healthcare
56Table of Contents
reform in the United States, a continuation or worsening of global economic conditions, patent expirations of competitive products and the launch of generic
competitors, continued government pricing pressures internationally and the potential volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We will continue to monitor these
conditions and will adjust our business processes, as appropriate, to mitigate these risks to our business.
The successes we experienced in 2010 have helped us maintain and build a financially sound business model that we believe will allow us to continue to
further expand our commercial, collaborative and R&D activities and to maintain quality and compliance. As we continue to grow our business, we remain focused on
profitable revenue growth and prudent expense management that we believe will enable solid execution of our operating objectives for 2011.
Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those
related to revenue recognition, intangible assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, prepaid royalties, clinical trial accruals, our tax provision and stock-based
compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.
We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Revenue Recognition
Product Sales
We recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is
fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as Medicaid reimbursements,
customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products. These estimates are deducted from gross
product sales at the time such revenues are recognized. Of these reductions from gross product sales, government rebates significantly impact our reported net
product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment by management.
Government Rebates
We estimate reductions to our revenues for government-managed Medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign
government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs. These reductions are settled
either by the company being invoiced directly or through charge-backs from our wholesalers. Government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in
accrued government rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual
government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price, which we record as
allowances against accounts receivable. Although we may pay rebates in countries outside of the United States, to date, payments made to foreign governments
have not represented a significant portion of our total government rebates. For government programs in the United States, we estimate these sales allowances based
on contractual terms, historical utilization rates, new information regarding changes in these programs’ regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of
the actual rebates, our
57Table of Contents
expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our
inventory management agreements. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, U.S government rebates of $1.38 billion, $885.5 million and $625.0 million, respectively, representing
15%, 12% and 10% of total gross product sales, respectively, were deducted from gross product sales. We believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our
sales allowances for government price reductions is reasonable and appropriate given the current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based
on the current information available to us, actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than 2% from our estimates recorded in those
periods. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had accrued U.S. government rebates of $318.3 million and $242.9 million, respectively, in accrued government rebates
and had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $53.5 million and $41.8 million, respectively, recorded against accounts receivable.
The following table summarizes the aggregate activity in our U.S. government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts:

Activity related to sales prior to 2009 206,273 6,902 212,547 628
Total $ 206,273 $ 885,495 $ 807,126 $ 284,642
Intangible Assets
In conjunction with business combinations that we have completed, we have recorded intangible assets primarily related to marketed products, IPR&D
projects and goodwill as part of our recognition and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Identifiable intangible assets,
such as those related to marketed products or IPR&D projects, are measured at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. We believe the fair values
assigned to our acquired intangible assets are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition
dates. Discounted cash flow models are used in valuing these intangible assets, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including
but not limited to:
• estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the products or product candidates;
• the probability of success for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development;
• the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates;
• the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product
candidate such as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals; and
• risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets.
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination. Goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are required to be tested for impairment at least annually.
We test
58Table of Contents
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or
changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair values of the assets below their carrying amounts. As of December 31, 2010, we had $562.2 million
of indefinite-lived intangible assets consisting of $532.7 million of goodwill resulting from various business combinations and $29.5 million of intangible assets related
to the IPR&D projects that we acquired from CGI and CV Therapeutics.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest
that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to the Ranexa product, which we acquired from CV
Therapeutics, over its estimated useful life using an amortization rate derived from our forecasted future product sales for Ranexa. Our product sales forecasts are
prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake
of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and
significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, we will prospectively update the rate used to amortize our intangible asset related to Ranexa which may increase
future cost of goods sold, as that is where we record the amortization expense. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to the Lexiscan product, which we also
acquired from CV Therapeutics, over its estimated useful life to cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis. Given that current Lexiscan revenues consist of royalties
received from a collaboration partner and our lack of ongoing access and visibility into that partner’s future sales forecasts, we cannot make a reasonable estimate of
the amortization rate using a forecasted product sales approach. As of December 31, 2010, we had $863.4 million of net unamortized finite-lived intangible assets
consisting primarily of intangible assets related to the marketed products that we acquired from CV Therapeutics.
Our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on our historical and projected future operating results, our extent or manner of use of
the acquired assets, legal and regulatory factors and events, our overall business strategy and market and economic trends. If events occur in the future that cause
us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain intangible assets are impaired, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely
impacted.
During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded $136.0 million of impairment charges related to certain IPR&D assets acquired from CV Therapeutics which we
had no future plans to develop and which were deemed to have no future use to us or other market participants. These charges related to the GS 9667, Adentri and
tecadenoson programs and were recorded in R&D expense. The majority of the impairment charge related to our GS 9667 program, a product candidate that was in
Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, which was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to unfavorable results from
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics tests that demonstrated limited effectiveness of the compound in patients. Given these results, we do not believe it has
alternative future uses for us or other market participants.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. This
allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including, but not limited to, contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and
individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days sales outstanding by geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential
impact on government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to
deteriorate, resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total
accounts receivable did not materially change from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to
cover anticipated losses under current conditions; however, significant deterioration in any of the above factors could materially change these expectations and may
result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts.
59Table of Contents
Prepaid Royalties
We capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost, specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory University (Emory) for the HIV
indication, based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to Emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product
sales incorporating emtricitabine. The present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted-average cost of capital. We review periodically
the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write-down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the
estimated life of the prepaid royalty. Some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor, significant deviations in
recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls.
We amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted future HIV product sales incorporating emtricitabine. Our
product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected
future patient usage or uptake of our products, the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a
previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts, including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors in
the same HIV market as emtricitabine, we will prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future cost of goods
sold, as that is where we record the amortization expense. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we
paid to Emory of $219.5 million and $245.0 million, respectively. Amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was $25.5 million, $29.9 million and $31.8
million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Clinical Trial Accruals
We record accruals for estimated clinical study costs. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third-party contract research organizations (CROs). These
costs are a significant component of R&D expenses. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we incurred CRO costs of $99.0 million, $109.9 million and $111.8 million,
respectively. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based
upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs. We validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed
reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and
make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the CROs.
Generally, a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs is associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment. We extensively outsource
our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start-up activities in-house. As a result, CROs typically perform most of the total start-up
activities for our trials, including document preparation, site identification, screening and preparation, pre-study visits, training and program management. Start-up
costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature.
The remaining clinical activities and related costs, such as patient monitoring and administration, generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual
contract or study. Most contracts are negotiated as fixed per unit prices and can vary in length between three months for a single dose Phase 1 clinical study and up
to two years or more for a more complex Phase 3 clinical study. The average length of contracts in 2010, 2009 and 2008 has been at the upper end of this range in order
to provide long-term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of Atripla, Truvada, Viread, Hepsera, Emtriva, Letairis and Ranexa. All of our
material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO and certain non-cancelable
expenses incurred at any point of termination. Amounts paid in advance relating to uncompleted services will be refunded to us if a contract is terminated. Some
contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract. Such
60Table of Contents
additional termination payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated. Through December 31, 2010, differences between actual
and estimated activity levels for any particular study have not been material. However, if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our
vendors or underestimates activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time, we may have to record additional and potentially significant R&D expenses
in future periods.
Tax Provision
We estimate our income tax provision, including deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on significant management judgment. We evaluate the realization of
all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely
than not to be realized. We consider future taxable income, ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a
valuation allowance.
If we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance, we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in
which such determination is first made.
Our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretation of existing laws or
regulations, our portion of the non-tax deductible pharmaceutical excise tax that we will be required to pay starting in 2011 as a result of the enactment of U.S.
healthcare reform legislation, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation, changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of
income before tax.
At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $126.5 million and $106.5 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax
benefits, $106.5 million and $72.6 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition.
As of December 31, 2010, we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $6.0 million in the next 12
months as we expect to have clarification from the tax authorities around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax
benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities.
We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of
limitations is open for 2003 and onward. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net
operating losses and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations remains open for 2002 and onwards.
Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for the
2005, 2006 and 2007 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant
disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We
periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions.
We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized
in an enterprise’s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain
61Table of Contents
tax positions currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these
uncertain tax positions in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period.
Stock-based Compensation
We measure all share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options, based on their relative fair values. Fair values of awards
granted under our stock option plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan were estimated at grant or purchase dates using a Black-Scholes option valuation model.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and expected award life.
Stock-based compensation is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income using a graded vesting
expense attribution approach for unvested stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, and using the straight-line expense attribution approach for stock options
granted after our adoption of new guidance for share-based payments to employees and directors on January 1, 2006. As stock-based compensation expenses,
related to stock options recognized on adoption of the new guidance, is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, gross expense has been reduced for estimated
forfeitures. The guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates. We estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience. Prior to the adoption of this guidance, pro forma information that was required to be disclosed
included forfeitures as they occurred. As a result of the guidance adopted on January 1, 2006, we only recognize a tax benefit from stock-based compensation in
additional paid-in capital (APIC) if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have
elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through our Consolidated
Statements of Income rather than through APIC.
During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized stock-based compensation expenses of $200.0 million, $185.8 million and $153.4
million, respectively, in operating expenses, and we capitalized $10.9 million, $11.4 million and $9.9 million, respectively, to inventory. As of December 31, 2010, we had
unrecognized stock-based compensation expenses of $260.8 million related to unvested stock options, which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted-
average period of 2.7 years.
Our management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of our Board, and the
Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to these critical accounting policies.
Results of Operations
Total Revenues
We had total revenues of $7.95 billion in 2010, $7.01 billion in 2009 and $5.34 billion in 2008. Included in total revenues were product sales, royalty revenues
and contract and other revenues. A significant percentage of our product sales continued to be denominated in foreign currencies and we face exposure to adverse
movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We used foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted
international sales, primarily those denominated in Euro. Foreign currency exchange had an unfavorable impact of $93.7 million on our 2010 revenues compared to
2009.

Total product sales $ 7,389,921 14% $ 6,469,311 27% $ 5,084,796
Total product sales increased by 14% in 2010 compared to 2009 and 27% in 2009 compared to 2008, due primarily to an overall increase in our antiviral product
sales driven by the strong growth of Atripla sales and the continued growth of Truvada sales. The growth of our cardiovascular products, Letairis and Ranexa, also
contributed to the overall increase in product sales in those periods.
Antiviral Products
Antiviral product sales increased by 12% in 2010 compared to 2009 and 25% in 2009 compared to 2008.
• Atripla
Atripla sales increased by 23% in 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. Atripla sales
increased by 51% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. The European growth benefited
from the launch of Atripla in France in the second quarter of 2009. Atripla sales include the efavirenz component which has a gross margin of zero. The
efavirenz portion of our Atripla sales was approximately $1.07 billion, $880.7 million and $576.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Atripla sales
accounted for 45%, 41% and 34% of our total antiviral product sales for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
• Truvada
Truvada sales increased by 6% in 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe. Truvada sales
increased by 18% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States and Europe, partially offset by an unfavorable
foreign currency exchange impact. Truvada sales accounted for 41%, 43% and 45% of our total antiviral product sales for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.
• Other Antiviral Products
Other antiviral product sales, which include product sales of Viread, Hepsera and Emtriva, decreased by 1% for 2010 compared to 2009 and 3% for 2009
compared to 2008, due primarily to sales volume decreases in Hepsera, partially offset by sales volume increases in Viread.
AmBisome
Sales of AmBisome increased by 2% in 2010 compared to 2009 and 3% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in certain markets
outside of the United States, partially offset by an
63Table of Contents
unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact. AmBisome product sales in the United States and Canada relate solely to our sales of AmBisome to Astellas Pharma
US, Inc. which are recorded at our manufacturing cost.
Letairis
Sales of Letairis increased by 31% for 2010 compared to 2009 and 63% in 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States.
Ranexa
Sales of Ranexa increased by 83% for 2010 compared to 2009, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the United States. Ranexa sales were $239.8 million for
2010 and $131.1 million for 2009. Ranexa sales began on April 15, 2009, the date Gilead acquired CV Therapeutics.
We expect total product sales to continue to grow in 2011 as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts to support continued opportunities for
market expansion.
Royalty Revenues
The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues (in thousands):
2010 Change 2009 Change 2008
Royalty revenues $ 545,970 11% $ 491,818 125% $ 218,180
Our most significant source of royalty revenues for 2010, 2009 and 2008 was from sales of Tamiflu by Roche. We recognize royalties on Tamiflu sales by Roche
in the quarter following the quarter in which Tamiflu is sold.
Royalty revenues for 2010 were $546.0 million, an increase of 11% compared to 2009. Other royalty revenues, which include royalties from GSK for Hepsera,
royalties from Astellas US LLC for Lexiscan and royalties from Japan Tobacco for Truvada contributed to the increase in total royalty revenues. Tamiflu royalties
from Roche contributed $386.5 million to total royalty revenues in 2010 compared to $392.7 million in 2009 as pandemic planning initiatives worldwide began to decline
throughout 2010. Royalty revenues for 2009 were $491.8 million, an increase of 125% compared to 2008, driven primarily by the recognition of Tamiflu royalties from
Roche of $392.7 million in 2009 compared to Tamiflu royalties from Roche of $155.5 million in 2008. The higher Tamiflu royalties for 2009 were due to increased Tamiflu
sales by Roche related primarily to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide.
Cost of Goods Sold and Product Gross Margin
The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales (in thousands), cost of goods sold (in thousands) and product gross
margin:
2010 Change 2009 Change 2008
Total product sales $7,389,921 14% $6,469,311 27% $ 5,084,796
Cost of goods sold $1,869,876 17% $1,595,558 42% $ 1,127,246
Product gross margin 75% 75% 78%
Our product gross margin for 2010 was 75%, consistent with our product gross margin for 2009. Our product gross margin for 2009 decreased to 75% from 78%
for 2008, due primarily to the higher proportion of Atripla sales, which has a gross margin of zero for the efavirenz component, as well as the amortization associated
with the intangible assets acquired in our acquisition of CV Therapeutics.
64Table of Contents
We expect our product gross margin in 2011 to be lower compared to 2010, due primarily to a higher proportion of expected Atripla sales.
Restructuring Expenses
During the second quarter of 2010, we approved and communicated a plan to close our research operations in Durham, North Carolina and consolidate our liver
disease research activities in Foster City, California. We believe this plan will allow our employees to collaborate more effectively and further advance our programs in
the liver disease area. During the year, we recorded a total of $14.6 million and $10.4 million in SG&A expenses and R&D expenses, respectively, related to employee
severance and facilities-related expenses under this plan. In December 2010, we closed our operations in Durham. We do not expect to incur any additional significant
costs in connection with this plan.
During the second quarter of 2009, we approved a plan to realize certain synergies as a result of the CV Therapeutics acquisition by re-aligning our
cardiovascular operations and eliminating redundancies. In 2010, we recorded $10.6 million and $3.4 million of restructuring expenses in SG&A and R&D expenses,
respectively, related to employee severance, relocation, lease termination costs and other facilities-related expenses. Total costs incurred under this plan were $36.8
million and $29.1 million in SG&A and R&D expenses, respectively. We do not expect to incur any additional costs in connection with this plan.
Research and Development Expenses
The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our R&D expenses (in thousands):
2010 Change 2009 Change 2008
Research and development $1,072,930 14% $939,918 30% $ 721,768
R&D expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, clinical studies performed by contract research
organizations, materials and supplies, licenses and fees, milestone payments under collaboration arrangements and overhead allocations consisting of various
support and facilities-related costs.
R&D expenses for 2010 increased by $133.0 million, or 14%, compared to 2009, due primarily to impairment charges of $136.0 million that we recorded related to
IPR&D assets acquired from CV Therapeutics, $23.5 million of clinical studies expenses related to increased HIV research activities and $16.1 million of compensation
and benefits expenses. The majority of the impairment charge related to our GS 9667 program, a product candidate that was in Phase 1 clinical studies for the
treatment of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, which was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to unfavorable results from pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics tests that demonstrated limited effectiveness of the compound in patients. Given these results, we do not believe it has alternative future uses for
us or other market participants. The increase in R&D expenses was partially offset by $37.0 million due to the timing of certain clinical studies and $30.3 million of
lower R&D expense reimbursement related to our collaboration with Tibotec.
R&D expenses in 2009 increased by $218.2 million, or 30%, compared to 2008, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $88.8 million
driven by higher headcount related to the growth of our business, the R&D expense reimbursement related to our collaboration with Tibotec of $52.4 million and
increased clinical study expenses of $23.9 million. The increase in compensation and benefits expenses was also driven by severance and termination benefits
associated with our restructuring activities related to our acquisition of CV Therapeutics.
In 2011, we expect R&D expenses to increase over 2010 levels due to increased spending on our internal and collaborative R&D efforts as we anticipate that
some of our product candidates will progress into more advanced clinical studies as well as adding more clinical development programs to our pipeline.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
The following table summarizes the period over period changes in our SG&A expenses (in thousands):
2010 Change 2009 Change 2008
Selling, general and administrative $1,044,392 10% $946,686 19% $ 797,344
SG&A expenses in 2010 increased by $97.7 million or 10%, compared to 2009, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $36.3 million as
a result of higher headcount to support our expanding commercial activities, increased contract and professional services expenses of $27.3 million driven primarily
by our expanding sales and marketing activities and $18.1 million related to facilities and equipment expenses.
SG&A expenses in 2009 increased by $149.3 million or 19%, compared to 2008, due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expenses of $75.4 million
driven by higher headcount related to the growth of our business, increased contract and professional services expenses of $46.6 million driven primarily by our
expanding sales and marketing activities and $5.8 million related to certain contract termination costs. The increase in compensation and benefits expenses was also
driven by severance and termination benefits associated with our restructuring activities related to our acquisition of CV Therapeutics.
In 2011, we expect SG&A expenses to increase over 2010 levels due to increased investment to support the continued growth in all of our franchises. We
believe we have the appropriate infrastructure to support the growth of our business in 2011.
Interest and Other Income, Net
We recorded interest and other income, net, of $60.3 million, $42.4 million and $59.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in interest and
other income, net, in 2010 compared to 2009 was due primarily to decreased costs related to our hedging activities. The decrease in interest and other income, net, in
2009 compared to 2008 was due primarily to decreased interest income of $40.6 million driven by a reduction in the average yield of our investment portfolio as a result
of lower interest rates, partially offset by an increase in net foreign currency exchange gains of $15.7 million.
Interest Expense
Our interest expense was $109.0 million, $69.7 million and $65.2 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2010 compared to
2009 was due primarily to the issuance of our convertible senior notes for $2.46 billion, net of issuance costs, in July 2010. The increase in interest expense in 2009
compared to 2008 was due primarily to the effect of accreting the debt discount on our convertible notes due in 2011 and 2013 as additional interest expense over the
expected life of the debt, as a result of adopting certain accounting guidance.
Provision for Income Taxes
Our provision for income taxes was $1.02 billion, $876.4 million and $702.4 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2010 effective tax rate of 26.2%
differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered
indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state taxes. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign
operations that are intended to be permanently reinvested.
The 2009 effective tax rate of 25.0% differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits, the resolution of certain tax positions with
tax authorities and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state
taxes and the revaluation of certain state tax assets related to the integration of CV Therapeutics.
66Table of Contents
The 2008 effective tax rate of 26.3% differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to tax credits, the resolution of certain tax positions with tax
authorities and certain operating earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely invested outside the United States, partially offset by state
taxes.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our working capital and our cash flow activities as of the end of, and for
each of, the periods presented (in thousands):

As of December 31:
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 5,318,071 $ 3,904,846 $ 3,239,639
Working capital $ 3,243,132 $ 2,940,927 $ 3,057,416
Year Ended December 31:

Financing activities $ (1,338,710) $ (1,051,438) $ (1,474,569)
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $5.32 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.41 billion or 36% from December 31, 2009. This
increase was primarily attributable to net cash provided by operations of $2.83 billion and proceeds of $2.46 billion from the issuance of convertible senior notes, net
of issuance costs, partially offset by $4.02 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase programs.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.90 billion at December 31, 2009, an increase of $665.2 million or 21% from December 31, 2008. This
increase was primarily attributable to net cash provided by operations of $3.08 billion and proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans
of $222.7 million, partially offset by the following:
• cash used to acquire CV Therapeutics of $1.13 billion, net of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities acquired from CV Therapeutics of $245.4
million;
• $998.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program; and
• $305.5 million used to extinguish the convertible senior notes we assumed in our acquisition of CV Therapeutics.
Working Capital
Working capital was $3.24 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of $302.2 million or 10% from working capital as of December 31, 2009. This increase was
primarily attributable to:
• an increase of $441.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities;
67Table of Contents
• an increase of $232.4 million in accounts receivable, net, primarily driven by increased product sales; and
• an increase of $152.0 million in inventories, due primarily to the purchase of efavirenz at its estimated net selling price from Bristol-Myers Squibb
Company (BMS).
This increase was partially offset by an increase of $640.8 million in the current portion of convertible senior notes, net and other long-term obligations, due to
the reclassification of our convertible senior notes due in 2011 to current liabilities.
Working capital was $2.94 billion at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $116.5 million or 4% from working capital as of December 31, 2008. This decrease was
primarily attributable to:
• an increase of $209.3 million in accounts payable, due primarily to the purchase of efavirenz at its estimated net selling price from BMS; and
• a decrease of $133.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities since we held a higher proportion of long-term marketable
securities as of December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008.
This decrease from 2008 to 2009 was partially offset by an increase of $366.1 million in our accounts receivable, net, driven primarily by increased product sales.
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities of $2.83 billion in 2010 primarily related to net income of $2.89 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $265.5 million
of depreciation and amortization expenses, $200.0 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $136.0 million of IPR&D impairment expenses and $82.1 million of tax
benefits from employee stock plans, partially offset by $680.4 million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities and $81.6 million of
excess tax benefits from stock option exercises which we reclassified to cash used in financing activities.
Cash provided by operating activities of $3.08 billion in 2009 primarily related to net income of $2.63 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $180.7 million
of stock-based compensation expenses and $148.4 million of amortization expenses. As a result of our adoption of the guidance for our joint ventures with BMS on
January 1, 2009, we reclassified the change in noncontrolling interest from cash provided by operating activities to cash used in financing activities.
Cash provided by operating activities of $2.14 billion in 2008 primarily related to net income of $1.97 billion, adjusted for non-cash items such as $209.5 million
of tax benefits from employee stock plans and $153.4 million of stock-based compensation expenses. This was partially offset by $191.9 million of excess tax benefits
from stock option exercises which we reclassified to cash used in financing activities.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities in 2010 was $1.94 billion, driven by a net use of $1.78 billion in purchases of marketable securities, $91.0 million used in our
acquisition of CGI and $61.9 million of capital expenditures.
Cash used in investing activities in 2009 was $2.22 billion, driven by cash used for our acquisition of CV Therapeutics of $1.25 billion (net of cash acquired), a
net use of $738.0 million in purchases of marketable securities and $230.1 million of capital expenditures for the year. Capital expenditures in 2009 included the
purchase of an office building and approximately 30 acres of land located in Foster City, California.
Cash used in investing activities in 2008 was $178.8 million, driven primarily by a net use of $53.0 million in purchases of marketable securities and $115.0
million of capital expenditures for the year.
68Table of Contents
Cash Used in Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities in 2010 was $1.34 billion, driven primarily by the $4.02 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock
repurchase programs and $362.6 million used to purchase note hedges related to our convertible senior notes due in 2014 and 2016. The cash outflows were partially
offset by $2.46 billion in proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes, net of issuance costs, $155.4 million in proceeds from the sale of warrants related to
our convertible senior notes and $221.2 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans.
Cash used in financing activities in 2009 was $1.05 billion, driven primarily by the $998.5 million used to repurchase our common stock under our stock
repurchase program and the $305.5 million used to extinguish the convertible senior notes assumed from the acquisition of CV Therapeutics. The cash outflows were
partially offset by proceeds of $222.7 million from issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans.
Cash used in financing activities in 2008 was $1.47 billion, driven primarily by the $1.97 billion used to repurchase our common stock under our stock
repurchase program. The cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds of $246.1 million that we received from issuances of common stock under our employee
stock plans as well as $191.9 million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises.
Other Information
Under our current three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board in May 2010, we repurchased $3.02 billion of our common stock
through December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, the remaining authorized amount of stock repurchases that may be made under our $5.00 billion repurchase
program was $1.98 billion. In May 2010, we had completed the $1.00 billion stock repurchase program previously authorized by our Board in January 2010. For the
year, we utilized a total of $4.02 billion of cash to repurchase and retire 109.9 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $36.57 per share.
In January 2011, our Board authorized an additional three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program which will commence upon the completion of our
existing program authorized in May 2010. We intend to use the additional authorization to repurchase our shares from time to time to offset the dilution created by
shares issued under employee stock plans and to repurchase shares opportunistically.
Under our amended and restated credit agreement, we, along with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gilead Biopharmaceutics Ireland Corporation, may borrow up
to an aggregate of $1.25 billion in revolving credit loans. The credit agreement also includes a sub-facility for swing-line loans and letters of credit. During the year,
we borrowed and repaid a $500.0 million loan under this revolving credit facility. Loans under the credit agreement bear interest at an interest rate of either LIBOR plus
a margin ranging from 20 basis points to 32 basis points or the base rate, as described in the credit agreement. The credit agreement will terminate in December 2012
and all unpaid borrowings thereunder shall be due and payable at that time. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay loans under the credit agreement in
whole or in part without penalty, subject to certain conditions. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $1.25 billion was available to be drawn down under this credit
agreement.
In July 2010, we issued $2.50 billion of convertible senior notes in a private placement and purchased convertible note hedges as well as sold warrants for a net
cost of $207.2 million. The cost of the convertible note hedges will be tax deductible over the life of the notes. The convertible note hedges and warrants are intended
to reduce the potential economic dilution upon future conversions of the notes by effectively increasing our conversion prices for the notes. We have used and will
continue to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes to repurchase shares of our common stock and repay existing indebtedness.
We believe that our existing capital resources, supplemented by cash generated from our operations, will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the
foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:
• the commercial performance of our current and future products;
69Table of Contents
• the progress and scope of our R&D efforts, including preclinical studies and clinical trials;
• the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews;
• the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities;
• administrative expenses;
• the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities;
• the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products;
• the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies; and
• costs associated with the defense, settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations.
We may in the future require additional funding, which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings. If such funding is required, we cannot
assure that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.
Contractual Obligations
Our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations, operating leases, capital commitments, purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and
inventory-related items and clinical trials contracts. The following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations, future commitments
and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligations may be cancelable as of December 31, 2010

(1) Convertible senior note obligations include future interest payments based on a fixed rate of 0.50% for notes due in 2011, 0.625% for notes due in 2013, 1.00%
for notes due in 2014 and 1.625% for notes due in 2016. At December 31, 2010, the carrying value of our convertible senior notes was $3.48 billion.
(2) At December 31, 2010, we had firm capital project commitments of approximately $27.3 million primarily relating to enterprise software purchase commitments
and facilities improvement projects.
(3) At December 31, 2010, we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory-related items. These amounts
include minimum purchase requirements and actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts.
(4) In addition to the above, we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing, collaboration and development
arrangements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and/or
commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recorded
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and have not been included in the table above.
70Table of Contents
(5) At December 31, 2010, we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. Although all of
our material contracts with CROs are cancelable, we historically have not cancelled such contracts. These amounts reflect commitments based on existing
contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to, or terminations of, existing contracts or anticipated or potential new contracts.
We had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities including interest and penalties of $143.7 million as of December 31, 2010. We believe that it is
reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $6.0 million in the next 12 months as we expect to have clarification from the tax
authorities around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable
estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities. Such amounts were included in long-term income taxes payable and non
current deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and have not been included in the table above.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new standards for revenue recognition for agreements with multiple deliverables. These
new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of
accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by
no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2011;
however, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of these standards will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2010, in response to the pharmaceutical excise tax mandated by healthcare reform legislation adopted in the United States, the FASB issued a new
standard to address how pharmaceutical manufacturers should recognize and classify this tax in their income statements. Effective 2011, we, along with other
pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of the pharmaceutical excise tax, calculated based on select government sales
for the preceding calendar year as a percentage of total industry government sales. The new standard clarifies that the pharmaceutical excise tax shall be presented as
an operating expense and that the liability related to the tax shall be estimated and recorded in full upon the first qualifying sale with a corresponding deferred cost
that is amortized to expense generally using a straight-line method of allocation. The new standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2011. We
estimate the 2011 impact of the pharmaceutical excise tax to be between $30–$50 million, which will be classified as SG&A expense in our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Also in December 2010, the FASB issued an update to its existing standard for business combinations to address the pro forma financial disclosure
requirements for business combinations. The updated standard specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose
pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning
of the comparable prior annual reporting period. The updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2011; however, early adoption is
permitted. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the United States, Canada and Ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the United
States, including Europe and Asia Pacific. As a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange
rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products. Our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency
exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and various foreign currencies,
71Table of Contents
the most significant of which is the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these currencies, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign
currency decreases. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens against these currencies, the relative amounts of such sales increase. Overall, we are a net receiver of
foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we
transact significant amounts of business.
A significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to
partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on net cash flows from our foreign currency denominated sales. We also hedge certain monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is
recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. In general, the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions
being hedged.
The following table summarizes the notional amounts, weighted-average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign currency exchange
forward contracts at December 31, 2010. We had no foreign currency exchange option contracts outstanding at December 31, 2010. All contracts have maturities of 18
months or less. Weighted-average rates are stated in terms of the amount of U.S. dollars per foreign currency. Fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at
December 31, 2010 (notional amounts and fair values in U.S. dollars and in thousands):

Turkish Lira 10,539 0.64 (11)
Polish Zloty 435 0.33 (0)
Total $ 3,554,521 $ 25,908
The total notional amount of $3.55 billion and total fair value relating to our net asset of $25.9 million on our open foreign currency exchange forward contracts
at December 31, 2010 is comparable to the total notional amount of $3.45 billion and total fair value relating to our net liability of $21.5 million on our open foreign
currency exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2009.
Interest Rate Risk
Our portfolio of available-for-sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk. With respect to our
investment portfolio, we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on credit rating, maturity, industry group and
investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows:
• safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk;
• liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and
• competitive after-tax rate of return.

(1) In April 2006, we issued convertible senior notes due in 2011 (2011 Notes) and 2013 (2013 Notes) in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended. The notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of 0.50% and 0.625% for the 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes, respectively, and may be
converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain circumstances.
In July 2010, we issued convertible senior notes due in 2014 (2014 Notes) and 2016 (2016 Notes) in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended. The notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of 1.00% and 1.625% for the 2014 Notes and 2016 Notes, respectively, and may be
converted into shares of our common stock subject to certain circumstances.
Credit Risk
As of December 31, 2010, we held approximately $70.8 million of auction rate securities within our available-for-sale long-term marketable securities. Our auction
rate securities comprised approximately 1% of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2010. In 2008, we began observing the
failed auctions for our auction rate securities for which the underlying assets are comprised of student loans. Most of our auction rate securities, including those
subject to the failed auctions, are currently rated AAA, consistent with the high quality rating required by our investment policy, supported by the federal
government as part of the Federal Family Education Loan Program and over-collateralized. Our auction rate securities reset every seven to 14 days with maturity dates
ranging from 2025 through 2040 and have annual interest rates ranging from 0.43% to 1.19%. As of December 31, 2010, our auction rate securities continued to earn
interest.
If auctions continue to fail for securities in which we have invested, we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities at par should we
need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities. However, based on our total cash and marketable securities position, our expected operating cash
flows as well as access to funds through our credit facility, we believe that we will be able to hold these securities until there is a recovery in the auction market and
the related securities, which may be at final maturity. As a result, we do not anticipate that the current illiquidity of these auction rate securities will have a material
effect on our cash requirements or working capital.
In light of the volatility and developments that we have seen in the financial markets, we continue to review our cash equivalents and marketable securities
carefully and strive to invest prudently. We believe that maintaining the primary goals of our investment policy, safety and preservation of principal and
diversification of risk, as well as liquidity, has helped protect us from many of the risks in the credit markets while allowing us to continue to meet our operating cash
flow requirements as well as execute on other strategic opportunities.
We are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. Our accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2010 was $1.62
billion, compared to $1.39 billion at December 31, 2009. The majority of our trade accounts receivable arises from product sales in the United States and Europe. To
date,

we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable. We believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was
adequate at December 31, 2010.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
An evaluation as of December 31, 2010 was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that the information required to be
disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at December 31, 2010.
(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations
and can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation, we concluded that our internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K and have issued a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. Their report on the audit of internal
control over financial reporting appears below.
(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated any changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2010, and has concluded that there was no change during such quarter that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Gilead Sciences, Inc.
We have audited Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Gilead Sciences, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the
COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2010 consolidated financial
statements of Gilead Sciences, Inc. and our report dated February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Gilead Sciences, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Gilead Sciences, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Gilead Sciences, Inc. at
December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for business combinations effective January
1, 2009.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Overview
Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead, we, us or our), incorporated in Delaware on June 22, 1987, is a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and
commercializes innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet medical need. Our mission is to advance the care of patients suffering from life threatening diseases
worldwide. Headquartered in Foster City, California, we have operations in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. We market products in the HIV/AIDS, liver
disease, respiratory and cardiovascular/metabolic therapeutic areas. Our product portfolio is comprised of Atripla® (efavirenz 600 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), Truvada® (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), Viread® (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and Emtriva® (emtricitabine) for the
treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; Hepsera® (adefovir dipivoxil) and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B; AmBisome®
(amphotericin B liposome for injection) for the treatment of severe fungal infections; Letairis® (ambrisentan) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension
(PAH); Ranexa® (ranolazine) for the treatment of chronic angina; Vistide® (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus infection and Cayston® (aztreonam
for inhalation solution) as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa).
In addition, we also sell and distribute certain products through our corporate partners under royalty-paying collaborative agreements. For example,
F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (together with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Roche) markets Tamiflu® (oseltamivir phosphate) for the treatment and prevention of influenza;
GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (GSK) markets Hepsera and Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in certain territories outside of the United States; GSK also markets
Volibris® (ambrisentan) outside of the United States for the treatment of PAH; Astellas Pharma US, Inc. markets AmBisome for the treatment of severe fungal
infections in the United States and Canada; Astellas US LLC markets Lexiscan® (regadenoson) injection in the United States for use as a pharmacologic stress agent
in radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI); Rapidscan Pharma Solutions, Inc. markets Rapiscan (regadenoson) in certain territories outside of the United
States for the inducement of pharmacological stress and/or vasodilation of the coronary vasculature strictly for purposes of diagnosing cardiovascular disease;
Menarini International Operations Luxembourg SA markets Ranexa in certain territories outside of the United States for the treatment of chronic angina; and Japan
Tobacco Inc. (Japan Tobacco) markets Truvada, Viread and Emtriva in Japan.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Gilead, our wholly-owned subsidiaries and our joint ventures with Bristol-
Myers Squibb Company (BMS), for which we are the primary beneficiary. We record a noncontrolling interest in our Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect
BMS’s interest in the joint ventures. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of companies
acquired by us from the date of each acquisition for the applicable reporting periods.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
On January 1, 2010, we adopted amended guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities. The amended guidance eliminates a mandatory
quantitative approach to determine whether a variable interest gives the entity a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity in favor of a qualitatively
focused analysis. Additionally, the amended guidance requires an ongoing reassessment of whether the entity is a primary beneficiary. We adopted the provisions of
this guidance on a prospective basis for our joint ventures with BMS, which we consolidate because we are the primary beneficiary. The adoption of this guidance
did not have any impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Significant Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments
The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including critical
accounting policies or estimates related to revenue recognition, intangible assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, prepaid royalties, clinical trial accruals, our tax
provision and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumptions that
we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Product Sales
We recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, delivery to the customer has occurred, the price is
fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Upon recognition of revenue from product sales, provisions are made for government rebates such as
Medicaid reimbursements, customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees and expected returns of expired products, as appropriate.
Items Deducted from Gross Product Sales
Government Rebates
We estimate reductions to our revenues for government-managed Medicaid programs as well as for certain other qualifying federal, state and foreign
government programs based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates, new information regarding changes in these programs’ regulations and guidelines that
would impact the amount of the actual rebates, our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and, for our U.S. product sales, channel
inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements. Government rebates that are invoiced directly to
us are recorded in accrued government rebates on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a
lower contractual government price, the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual government price,
which we record as allowances against accounts receivable.
Cash Discounts
We estimate cash discounts based on contractual terms, historical utilization rates and our expectations regarding future utilization rates.
Distributor Fees
Under our inventory management agreements with our significant U.S. wholesalers, we pay the wholesalers a fee primarily for the compliance of certain
contractually determined covenants such as the maintenance of agreed upon inventory levels. These distributor fees are based on a contractually determined fixed
percentage of sales.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Product Returns
We do not provide our customers with a general right of product return, but permit returns if the product is damaged or defective when received by the
customer, or in the case of product sold in the Unites States and certain countries outside the United States, if the product has expired. We will accept returns for
product that will expire within six months prior to or that have expired up to one year after their expiration dates. Our estimates for expected returns of expired
products are based primarily on an ongoing analysis of historical return patterns.
Royalty Revenues
Royalty revenue from sales of Lexiscan and AmBisome by Astellas US LLC and Astellas Pharma US, Inc., respectively, is recognized in the month following
the month in which the corresponding sales occur. Royalty revenue from sales of our other products is generally recognized when received, which is generally in the
quarter following the quarter in which the corresponding sales occur.
Contract and Other Revenues
Revenue from non-refundable up-front license fees and milestone payments such as under a development collaboration or an obligation to supply product, is
recognized as performance occurs and our obligations are completed. In accordance with the specific terms of our obligations under these arrangements, revenue is
recognized as the obligation is fulfilled or ratably over the development or manufacturing period. Revenue associated with substantive at-risk milestones is
recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as defined in the respective agreements. Advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are
classified as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Shipping and handling costs incurred for inventory purchases and product shipments are recorded in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of
Income.
Research and Development Expenses
Major components of research and development (R&D) expenses consist of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation,
clinical studies performed by contract research organizations (CROs), materials and supplies, licenses and fees, milestone payments under collaboration arrangements
and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs.
We charge R&D costs, including clinical study costs, to expense when incurred. Clinical study costs are a significant component of R&D expenses. Most of
our clinical studies are performed by third-party CROs. We monitor levels of performance under each significant contract including the extent of patient enrollment
and other activities through communications with our CROs. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs over the service periods specified in the
contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs. We validate our
accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts. Based upon the results of these validation
processes, we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred
by the CROs.
All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the CRO and certain
non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination.
94Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Amounts paid in advance related to uncompleted services will be refunded to us if a contract is terminated. Some contracts may include additional termination
payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract. Such additional termination payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract
will be terminated.
Advertising Expenses
We expense the costs of advertising, including promotional expenses, as incurred. Advertising expenses were $116.5 million in 2010, $108.1 million in 2009 and
$96.2 million in 2008.
Net Income Per Share Attributable to Gilead Common Stockholders
Basic net income per share attributable to Gilead common stockholders is calculated based on the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share attributable to Gilead common stockholders is calculated based on the weighted-average number of
shares of our common stock outstanding and other dilutive securities outstanding during the period. The potential dilutive shares of our common stock resulting
from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and performance shares and the assumed exercise of warrants relating to the
convertible senior notes due in 2011 (2011 Notes), 2013 (2013 Notes), 2014 (2014 Notes) and 2016 (2016 Notes) (collectively, the Notes) are determined under the
treasury stock method.
Because the principal amount of the Notes will be settled in cash, only the conversion spread relating to the Notes is included in our calculation of diluted net
income per share attributable to Gilead common stockholders. Our common stock resulting from the assumed settlement of the conversion spread of the Notes has a
dilutive effect when the average market price of our common stock during the period exceeds the conversion prices of $38.75, $38.10, $45.08 and $45.41 for the 2011
Notes, 2013 Notes, 2014 Notes and 2016 Notes, respectively. For the years ended 2010, 2009 and 2008, the average market prices of our common stock exceeded the
conversion prices of the 2011 and 2013 Notes and the dilutive effects are included in the accompanying table.
Warrants relating to the 2011 Notes, 2013 Notes, 2014 Notes and 2016 Notes have a dilutive effect when the average market price of our common stock during
the period exceeds the warrants’ exercise prices of $50.80, $53.90, $56.76 and $60.10, respectively. The average market prices of our common stock during the years
ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 did not exceed the warrants’ exercise prices relating to any of the Notes; therefore, these warrants did not have a dilutive
effect on our net income per share for those periods.
Stock options to purchase approximately 22.5 million, 17.4 million and 11.4 million weighted-average shares of our common stock were outstanding during the
years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share attributable to Gilead common
stockholders because their effect was antidilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation
Share-based payments to employees are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income based on their fair values and the benefit of tax deductions in
excess of recognized compensation cost are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing activity, rather than as an operating activity. The
calculated pool of excess tax benefits is recorded as part of additional paid-in capital (APIC).
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and an original maturity of three months or less on the purchase date to be cash
equivalents. We may enter into overnight repurchase agreements (repos) under which we purchase securities with an obligation to resell them the following day.
Securities purchased under agreements to resell are recorded at face value and reported as cash and cash equivalents. Under our investment policy, we may enter
into repos with major banks and authorized dealers provided that such repos are collateralized by U.S. government securities with a fair value of at least 102% of the
fair value of securities sold to us. Other eligible instruments under our investment policy that are included in cash equivalents include commercial paper, money
market funds and other bank obligations.
Marketable and Nonmarketable Securities
We determine the appropriate classification of our marketable securities, which consist primarily of debt securities and which include auction rate securities
and variable rate demand obligations, at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. All of our marketable securities are
considered as available-for-sale and carried at estimated fair values and reported in either cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities or long-term marketable
securities. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are excluded from net income and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Interest and other income, net, includes interest, dividends, amortization of purchase premiums and discounts,
realized gains and losses on sales of securities and other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of securities, if any. The cost of securities sold is based on the
specific
96Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
identification method. We regularly review all of our investments for other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Our review includes the consideration of the cause
of the impairment, including the creditworthiness of the security issuers, the number of securities in an unrealized loss position, the severity and duration of the
unrealized losses, whether we have the intent to sell the securities and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before the
recovery of their amortized cost basis. When we determine that the decline in fair value of an investment is below our accounting basis and this decline is other-than-
temporary, we reduce the carrying value of the security we hold and record a loss for the amount of such decline.
As a result of entering into collaborations, from time to time, we may hold investments in non-public companies. We record these nonmarketable securities at
cost in other noncurrent assets, less any amounts for other-than-temporary impairment. We regularly review our securities for indicators of impairment. Investments
in nonmarketable securities are not material for the periods presented.
Concentrations of Risk
We are subject to credit risk from our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Under our investment policy, we limit amounts invested in such
securities by credit rating, maturity, industry group, investment type and issuer, except for securities issued by the U.S. government. We are not exposed to any
significant concentrations of credit risk from these financial instruments. The goals of our investment policy, in order of priority, are as follows: safety and
preservation of principal and diversification of risk; liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements; and a competitive after-tax rate of return.
We are also subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales. The majority of our trade accounts receivable arises from product
sales in the United States and Europe. To date, we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable. We believe that
our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate at December 31, 2010.
Certain of the raw materials and components that we utilize in our operations are obtained through single suppliers. Certain of the raw materials that we utilize
in our operations are made at only one facility. Since the suppliers of key components and raw materials must be named in a new drug application (NDA) filed with
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a product, significant delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required. If delivery of material from
our suppliers were interrupted for any reason, we may be unable to ship our commercial products or to supply any of our product candidates for clinical trials.
Accounts Receivable
Trade accounts receivable are recorded net of allowances for wholesaler chargebacks related to government rebate programs, cash discounts for prompt
payment, doubtful accounts and sales returns. Estimates for wholesaler chargebacks for government rebates, cash discounts and sales returns are based on
contractual terms, historical trends and our expectations regarding the utilization rates for these programs. Estimates for our allowance for doubtful accounts is
determined based on existing contractual payment terms, historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances, an analysis of days
sales outstanding by geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement
practices. Historically, the amounts of uncollectible accounts receivable that have been written off have been insignificant and consistent with management’s
expectations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Inventories
Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. We periodically review the composition of our
inventories in order to identify obsolete, slow-moving or otherwise unsaleable items. If unsaleable items are observed and there are no alternate uses for the
inventory, we will record a write-down to net realizable value in the period that the impairment is first recognized.
Prepaid Royalties
Prepaid royalties are capitalized at cost, which initially is equivalent to the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to the
licensor on expected future levels of product sales incorporating the related technology. We review periodically the expected future sales levels of our products and
any indicators that might require a write-down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty. We amortize our
prepaid royalties to cost of goods sold over the remaining life of the underlying patent based on an effective royalty rate derived from forecasted future product sales
incorporating the related technology. We review our effective royalty rate at least annually and prospectively adjust the effective rate based on significant new facts
or circumstances that may arise from our review.
Our prepaid royalties are primarily comprised of emtricitabine royalties we paid to Emory University (Emory) for the HIV indication when we and Royalty
Pharma purchased the royalty interest owned by Emory in 2005. Under the terms of the transaction, we and Royalty Pharma paid 65% and 35%, respectively, of the
total purchase price of $525.0 million to Emory in exchange for the elimination of the emtricitabine royalties due to Emory on worldwide net sales of products
containing emtricitabine. As a result of this transaction, we capitalized as prepaid royalties our 65% share of the $525.0 million purchase price, or $341.3 million. As of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had an unamortized prepaid royalty asset of $219.5 million and $245.0 million, respectively. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, $25.5 million, $29.9
million and $31.8 million were amortized to cost of goods sold, respectively.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the
straight-line method. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Estimated useful lives in years are as follows:
Description Estimated Useful Life
Buildings and improvements 20-35
Laboratory and manufacturing equipment 4-10
Office and computer equipment 3-7
Leasehold improvements Shorter of useful life
or lease term
Office and computer equipment includes capitalized software. We had unamortized capitalized software costs of $22.5 million and $25.2 million on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Leasehold improvements and capitalized leased equipment are amortized over the
shorter of the lease term or the asset’s useful life. Amortization of capitalized leased equipment is included in depreciation expense. Capitalized interest on
construction in-progress is included in property, plant and equipment. Interest capitalized in 2010, 2009 and 2008 was not significant.

GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination. Other intangible assets primarily related to marketed products and purchased in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects from our
acquisitions of CGI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CGI) in July 2010 and CV Therapeutics, Inc. (CV Therapeutics) in April 2009, and are measured at their respective fair values
as of the acquisition date. We do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. We test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible
assets for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a
reduction in the fair value of the assets below their carrying amounts.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest
that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We amortize the intangible asset related to Ranexa, which we acquired from CV Therapeutics, over its
estimated useful life using an amortization rate derived from our forecasted future product sales for Ranexa. Our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and
determined using our best estimates of future activity and consider such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products, the
introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans. If a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to
our sales forecasts, we will prospectively update the rate used to amortize our intangible asset related to Ranexa which may increase future cost of goods sold, as that
is where we record the amortization expense. We amortize the intangible asset related to Lexiscan, which we also acquired from CV Therapeutics, over its estimated
useful life to cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis. Given that current Lexiscan revenues consist of royalties received from a collaboration partner and our lack
of ongoing access and visibility into that partner’s future sales forecasts, we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amortization rate using a forecasted product
sales approach.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The carrying value of long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances both internally and externally that may
suggest impairment. Specific potential indicators of impairment include a significant decrease in the fair value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner
in which an asset is used or a significant physical change in an asset, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that affects the value of
an asset, an adverse action or assessment by the FDA or another regulator, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to
acquire or construct an asset and operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates
continuing losses associated with an income producing asset.
Should there be an indication of impairment, we will test for recoverability by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from
the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition to the carrying amount of the asset or asset group. Any excess of the carrying value of the asset or
asset group over its estimated fair value will be recognized as an impairment loss.
Foreign Currency Translation, Transactions and Contracts
Adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars are excluded from the determination of net income
and are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Net foreign currency exchange transaction
gains or losses are included in interest and other income, net, on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Net transaction losses totaled $3.7 million, $16.4 million and
$36.5 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
99Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
We hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures related to outstanding monetary assets and liabilities as well as forecasted product sales using foreign
currency exchange forward and option contracts. In general, the market risk related to these contracts is offset by corresponding gains and losses on the hedged
transactions. The credit risk associated with these contracts is driven by changes in interest and currency exchange rates and, as a result, varies over time. By
working only with major banks and closely monitoring current market conditions, we limit the risk that counterparties to these contracts may be unable to perform.
We also limit our risk of loss by entering into contracts that permit net settlement at maturity. Therefore, our overall risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default
is limited to the amount of any unrecognized gains on outstanding contracts (i.e., those contracts that have a positive fair value) at the date of default. We do not
enter into derivative contracts for trading purposes, nor do we hedge our net investment in any of our foreign subsidiaries.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Our financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, foreign currency exchange forward and
option contracts, accounts payable, and short-term and long-term debt. Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and foreign currency exchange contracts
that hedge accounts receivable and forecasted sales are reported at their respective fair values on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying value and fair value
of the Notes were $3.48 billion and $3.97 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2010. The carrying value and fair value of the Notes were $1.16 billion and $1.58
billion, respectively as of December 31, 2009. The fair value of the Notes was based on their quoted market values. The remaining financial instruments are reported
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at amounts that approximate current fair values.
Income Taxes
Our income tax provision is computed under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Significant estimates are
required in determining our provision for income taxes. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Various factors may
have favorable or unfavorable effects on our income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, interpretations of existing tax laws, changes in tax laws and
rates, our portion of the non-tax deductible pharmaceutical excise tax that we will be required to pay starting in 2011 as a result of the enactment of U.S. healthcare
reform legislation, the accounting for stock options and other share-based payments, mergers and acquisitions, future levels of R&D spending, changes in
accounting standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings and resolution
of federal, state and foreign income tax audits. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factors may be significant and could have
a negative impact on our consolidated net income.
We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized
in an enterprise’s financial statements by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We do not believe any such uncertain tax positions currently pending will have a material
adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax positions in any period could have a
material impact on the results of operations for that period.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new standards for revenue recognition for agreements with multiple
deliverables. These new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate
units of accounting. Additionally, these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified
deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration. These new standards are effective for us beginning in the first
quarter of 2011; however, early adoption is permitted. The adoption of these standards will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2010, in response to the pharmaceutical excise tax mandated by healthcare reform legislation adopted in the United States, the FASB issued a new
standard to address how pharmaceutical manufacturers should recognize and classify this tax in their income statements. Effective 2011, we, along with other
pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are required to pay a portion of the pharmaceutical excise tax, calculated based on select government sales
for the preceding calendar year as a percentage of total industry government sales. The new standard clarifies that the pharmaceutical excise tax shall be presented as
an operating expense and that the liability related to the tax shall be estimated and recorded in full upon the first qualifying sale with a corresponding deferred cost
that is amortized to expense generally using a straight-line method of allocation. The new standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2011. We
estimate the 2011 impact of the pharmaceutical excise tax to be between $30–$50 million, which will be classified as selling, general and administrative expense in our
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Also in December 2010, the FASB issued an update to its existing standard for business combinations to address the pro forma financial disclosure
requirements for business combinations. The updated standard specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose
pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning
of the comparable prior annual reporting period. The updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2011; however, early adoption is
permitted. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
2. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We determine the fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities using the fair value hierarchy, which establishes three levels of inputs that may
be used to measure fair value, as follows:
Level 1 inputs which include quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 inputs which include observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices for identical or
similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full
term of the asset or liability; and
Level 3 inputs which include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the underlying
asset or liability. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies
or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation.

Marketable securities, measured at fair value using Level 2 inputs, are primarily comprised of U.S. government agencies and FDIC guaranteed securities and
corporate debt securities. We review trading activity and pricing for these investments as of the measurement date. When sufficient quoted pricing for identical
securities is not available, we use market pricing and other observable market inputs for similar securities obtained from various third-party data providers. These
inputs either represent quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or have been derived from observable market data. This approach results in the Level 2
classification of these securities within the fair value hierarchy.

Our policy is to recognize transfers into or out of Level 3 classification as of the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
Marketable securities, measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs, are substantially comprised of auction rate securities within our available-for-sale investment
portfolio. The underlying assets of our auction rate securities consist of student loans. Although auction rate securities would typically be measured using Level 2
inputs, the failure of auctions and the lack of market activity and liquidity experienced since the beginning of 2008 required that these securities be measured using
Level 3 inputs. The fair value of our auction rate securities was determined using a discounted cash flow model that considered projected cash flows for the issuing
trusts, underlying collateral and expected yields. Projected cash flows were estimated based on the underlying loan principal, bonds outstanding and payout
formulas. The weighted-average life over which the cash flows were projected considered the collateral composition of the securities and related historical and
projected prepayments. The underlying student loans have a weighted-average expected life of four to eight years. The discount rates used in our discounted cash
flow model were based on market conditions for comparable or similar term asset-backed and other fixed income securities, adjusted for an illiquidity discount. This
resulted in an annual discount rate of 2.12%. Our auction rate securities reset every seven to 14 days with maturity dates ranging from 2025 through 2040 and have
annual interest rates ranging from 0.43% to 1.19%. As of December 31, 2010, our auction rate securities continued to earn interest.
Our auction rate securities were recorded in long-term marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2010 and 2009. Although
there continued to be failed auctions as well as lack of market activity and liquidity in 2010, we believe we had no other-than-temporary impairments on these
securities as of December 31, 2010 because we do not intend to sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities
before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.

As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately 34% and 32%, respectively, of the total number of securities were in an unrealized loss position. The gross
unrealized losses for auction rate securities were caused by a higher discount rate used in the valuation of these securities as compared to the coupon rates of these
securities. The gross unrealized losses for the other securities were primarily the result of an increase in the yield-to-maturity of the underlying securities. No
significant facts or circumstances have arisen to indicate that there has been any deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuers of these securities. Based on our
review of these securities, we believe we had no other-than-temporary impairments on these securities as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 because we do not intend to
sell these securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.

4. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
We operate in foreign countries, which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and
various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro. In order to manage this risk, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures related to
outstanding monetary assets and liabilities as well as forecasted product sales using foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts. In general, the market
risk related to these contracts is offset by corresponding gains and losses on the hedged transactions. The credit risk associated with these contracts is driven by
changes in interest and currency exchange rates and, as a result, varies over time. By working only with major banks and closely monitoring current market
conditions, we limit the risk that counterparties to these contracts may be unable to perform. We also limit our risk of loss by entering into contracts that permit net
settlement at maturity. Therefore, our overall risk of loss in the event of a counterparty default is limited to the amount of any unrecognized gains on outstanding
contracts (i.e., those contracts that have a positive fair value) at the date of default. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading purposes, nor do we hedge
our net investment in any of our foreign subsidiaries.
We hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for certain monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that are
denominated in a non-functional currency. The derivative instruments we use to hedge this exposure are not designated as hedges, and as a result, changes in their
fair value are recorded in interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.
We hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for forecasted product sales that are denominated in a non-functional currency. The
derivative instruments we use to hedge this exposure are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturity dates of 18 months or less. Upon executing a hedging
contract and quarterly thereafter, we assess prospective hedge effectiveness using a regression analysis which calculates the change in cash flow as a result of the
hedge instrument. On a monthly basis, we assess retrospective hedge effectiveness using a dollar offset approach. We exclude time value from our effectiveness
testing and recognize changes in the time value of the hedge in interest and other income, net. The effective component of our hedge is recorded as an unrealized
gain or loss on the hedging instrument in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) within stockholders’ equity. When the hedged forecasted transaction
occurs, the hedge is de-designated and the unrealized gains or losses are reclassified into product sales. The majority of gains and losses related to the hedged
forecasted transactions reported in accumulated OCI at December 31, 2010 will be reclassified to product sales within 12 months.
We had notional amounts on foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding of $3.55 billion and $3.45 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

5. ACQUISITIONS
On January 1, 2009, we adopted guidance for recognizing and measuring assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree in
a business combination. The guidance requires, for example, that IPR&D be capitalized at fair value as intangible assets at the time of acquisition and acquisition-
related expenses and restructuring costs be recognized separately from the business combination. We adopted the provisions of this guidance on a prospective
basis and applied it to our acquisitions of CGI in 2010 and CV Therapeutics in 2009, as discussed below.
CGI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
In June 2010, we entered into an agreement to acquire CGI for up to $120.0 million in cash, consisting of $91.0 million as an upfront payment and up to $29.0
million of contingent consideration payable based on the achievement of clinical development milestones. This transaction closed on July 8, 2010, at which time CGI
became a wholly-owned subsidiary. CGI was a privately-held development stage pharmaceutical company based in Branford, Connecticut, primarily focused on small
molecule chemistry and protein kinase biology. The lead preclinical compound from CGI’s library of proprietary small molecule kinase inhibitors targets spleen
tyrosine kinase (Syk) and could have unique applications for the treatment of serious inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis. We believe the
acquisition provides us with an opportunity to expand our research efforts in an interesting and promising area of drug discovery.
The CGI acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The results of operations of CGI since July 8, 2010 have been included in our Consolidated
Statements of Income and were not significant.
The acquisition-date fair value of the total consideration transferred to acquire CGI was $102.1 million, and consisted of cash paid at or prior to closing of $91.0
million and contingent consideration of $11.1 million.
The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at July 8, 2010 (in thousands):
Intangible assets—IPR&D $ 26,630
Goodwill 70,111
Deferred tax assets 12,656
Deferred tax liabilities (6,313)
Other net liabilities assumed (984)
Total consideration transferred $ 102,100
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets associated with in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects relate to the preclinical Syk product candidate. Management
estimated the acquisition-date fair value of intangible assets related to IPR&D to be $26.6 million. The estimated fair value was determined using the income approach,
which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. We estimated the fair value using a present value discount rate of 18%, which is based on the estimated
weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles substantially similar to that of CGI. This is comparable to the estimated internal rate of return for CGI’s
operations and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets. The projected cash flows from the IPR&D project was based on
key assumptions such as: estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the project considering its stage of development; the time and resources needed to
complete the development and approval of the product candidate; the life of the potential commercialized product and
109Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
associated risks, including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other
regulatory agencies; and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects
are considered to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived,
they will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis as well as between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes
in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. If and when development is
complete, which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets would be deemed finite-lived and would then
be amortized based on their respective estimated useful lives at that point in time.
Goodwill
The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is $70.1 million, which represents the
goodwill amount resulting from the CGI acquisition. Management believes that the goodwill mainly represents the synergies expected from combining our research
and development operations as well as acquiring CGI’s assembled workforce and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. We recorded
the goodwill as an intangible asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as well as
between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the goodwill below
its carrying amount. As we have elected to treat the CGI acquisition as an asset acquisition for California state tax purposes, the goodwill resulting from the
acquisition is deductible for California state income tax purposes, although such amounts are not deductible for federal income tax purposes.
We do not consider the CGI acquisition to be a material business combination and therefore have not disclosed the pro forma results of operations as required
for material business combinations.
CV Therapeutics, Inc.
On April 15, 2009, we acquired CV Therapeutics through a cash tender offer under the terms of an agreement and plan of merger entered into in March 2009. CV
Therapeutics was a publicly-held biopharmaceutical company based in Palo Alto, California, primarily focused on the discovery, development and commercialization
of small molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic and pulmonary diseases. CV Therapeutics had two marketed products, Ranexa for the treatment
of chronic angina and Lexiscan injection for use as a pharmacologic stress agent in radionuclide MPI in patients unable to undergo adequate exercise stress. CV
Therapeutics also had several product candidates in clinical development for the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic and pulmonary diseases.
The CV Therapeutics acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The results of operations of CV Therapeutics since April 15, 2009 have been
included in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The acquisition date was determined to be April 15, 2009 as that is the date on which we acquired approximately
89% of the outstanding shares of common stock of CV Therapeutics and obtained effective control of the company. The acquisition was completed two days later on
April 17, 2009, at which time CV Therapeutics became a wholly-owned subsidiary.
The aggregate consideration transferred to acquire CV Therapeutics was $1.39 billion, and consisted of cash paid for common stock and other equity
instruments at or prior to closing of $1.38 billion and the fair value of vested stock options assumed of $15.7 million.
110Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
In accordance with the merger agreement, the number of Gilead stock options and restricted stock units into which assumed CV Therapeutics’ stock options
and restricted stock units were converted was determined based on an option conversion ratio. This conversion ratio was calculated by taking the per share
acquisition price of $20.00 and dividing it by the average closing price of our common stock for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding (but not
including) the closing date of April 17, 2009, which was $46.24 per share. The fair value of stock options assumed was calculated using a Black-Scholes valuation
model with the following assumptions: market price of $44.54 per share, which was the closing price of our common stock on the acquisition date; expected term
ranging from 0.1 to 5.2 years; risk-free interest rate ranging from 0.1% to 1.7%; expected volatility ranging from 37.4% to 43.2%; and no dividend yield. The fair value
of restricted stock units assumed was calculated using the acquisition-date closing price of $44.54 per share for our common stock.
We included the fair value of vested stock options assumed by us of $15.7 million in the consideration transferred for the acquisition. We did not assume any
vested restricted stock units. The estimated fair value of unvested stock options and restricted stock units assumed by us of $11.2 million was not included in the
consideration transferred and is being recognized as stock-based compensation expenses over the remaining future vesting period of the awards.
The following table summarizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at April 15, 2009 (in thousands):
Intangible assets—marketed products $ 951,200

Intangible Assets
A substantial portion of the assets acquired consisted of intangible assets related to CV Therapeutics’ two marketed products, Ranexa and Lexiscan, and CV
Therapeutics’ IPR&D projects. Management determined that the estimated acquisition-date fair values of the intangible assets related to the marketed products and
IPR&D projects were $951.2 million and $138.9 million, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
Of the $951.2 million of intangible assets related to the marketed products, $688.4 million related to Ranexa and $262.8 million related to Lexiscan. We have
determined that these intangible assets have finite useful lives and will be amortized over their respective useful lives, which we estimated to be the periods over
which the associated product patents will expire as those are the periods over which the intangible assets are expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the
related products.
We are amortizing the intangible asset related to Ranexa over its estimated useful life using an amortization rate derived from our forecasted future product
sales for Ranexa. We are amortizing the intangible asset related to Lexiscan over its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. Given that current Lexiscan revenues
consist of royalties received from a collaboration partner and our lack of ongoing access and visibility into that partner’s future sales forecasts, we cannot make a
reasonable estimate of the amortization rate using a forecasted product sales approach. The weighted-average amortization period for these intangible assets is
approximately ten years.
Of the $138.9 million of intangible assets related to the IPR&D projects, $93.4 million related to GS 9667 (formerly CVT-3619), a product candidate that was in
Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia. The remaining balance of the intangible assets related to IPR&D projects represented
various other in-process projects with no single project comprising a significant portion of the total value. Intangible assets related to IPR&D projects are considered
to be indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated R&D efforts. During the period the assets are considered indefinite-lived, they will not be
amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that
would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the IPR&D projects below their respective carrying amounts. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded $136.0
million of impairment charges related to certain IPR&D assets acquired from CV Therapeutics which we had no future plans to develop and which were deemed to
have no future use to us or other market participants. These charges related to the GS 9667, Adentri and tecadenoson programs and were recorded in R&D expense.
The majority of the impairment charge related to our GS 9667 program, which was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to unfavorable results from
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics tests that demonstrated limited effectiveness of the compound in patients. Given these results, we do not believe it has
alternative future uses for us or other market participants. As of December 31, 2010, we had $2.9 million of IPR&D assets acquired from CV Therapeutics remaining on
our Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Deferred Tax Assets and Deferred Tax Liabilities
The $413.8 million of deferred tax assets resulting from the acquisition was primarily related to federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
The $426.9 million of deferred tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition was primarily related to the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible
assets related to the marketed products and IPR&D projects. We have concluded that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefit from deferred tax
assets related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards. As a result, a valuation allowance of $15.1 million was recorded related to those deferred tax assets.
For presentation purposes, the $426.9 million of deferred tax liabilities, all of which is of a noncurrent nature, has been netted against noncurrent deferred tax assets
on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. As a result of the impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010, we reduced the deferred tax liabilities related to
IPR&D projects by $49.7 million.
Convertible Senior Notes
As a result of the acquisition, we assumed convertible notes from CV Therapeutics consisting of 2.75% senior subordinated convertible notes due 2012, 3.25%
senior subordinated convertible notes due 2013 and 2.0%
112Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
senior subordinated convertible debentures due 2023. All of these convertible notes were recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date. In May 2009, we
offered to repurchase these convertible notes in consideration for their par value plus accrued interest, as required under the terms of the respective convertible note
agreements following the occurrence of a change in control or fundamental change as defined in the agreements. As of December 31, 2010, all of these convertible
notes have been extinguished.
Goodwill
The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was $341.9 million, which represents the
goodwill amount resulting from the acquisition. Management believes that the goodwill mainly represents the synergies and economies of scale expected from
combining our operations with CV Therapeutics. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. We recorded the goodwill as an
intangible asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if we
become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying amount.
Navitas Assets, LLC
In May 2008, we executed an asset purchase agreement with Navitas Assets, LLC (Navitas) to acquire all of the assets related to its cicletanine business. We
acquired the exclusive rights to regulatory data and filings for development of cicletanine as a monotherapy for PAH and for other indications in the United States.
We are evaluating cicletanine, currently in Phase 2 clinical trials, as a potential treatment of PAH.
The aggregate consideration transferred for the acquisition was $10.9 million, and consisted primarily of cash paid. In addition, Navitas is entitled to potential
additional purchase consideration, including payments contingent on future achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. These amounts will be
recorded when and if the related contingencies are resolved. The consideration transferred was allocated to IPR&D which represents the purchased IPR&D program
for cicletanine that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses as of the acquisition date, and therefore, was expensed upon
acquisition within our Consolidated Statement of Income.
6. RESTRUCTURING
During the second quarter of 2010, we implemented a plan to close our research operations in Durham, North Carolina and consolidate our liver disease
research activities in Foster City, California. The restructuring plan includes consolidation of the liver disease R&D organization and our exit from certain facilities.
During the year, we recorded a total of $14.6 million and $10.4 million in SG&A expenses and R&D expenses, respectively, related to employee severance and
facilities-related expenses under this plan. In December 2010, we closed our operations in Durham. We do not expect to incur any additional significant costs in
connection with this plan.
During the second quarter of 2009, we approved a plan to realize certain synergies as a result of the CV Therapeutics acquisition by re-aligning our
cardiovascular operations and eliminating redundancies. The restructuring plan included consolidation and re-alignment of the cardiovascular R&D organization, our
exit from certain facilities and the termination of certain contractual obligations. In 2010, we recorded $10.6 million and $3.4 million of restructuring expenses in SG&A
and R&D expenses, respectively. Comparatively, in 2009, we recorded $26.2 million and $25.7 million in SG&A and R&D expenses, respectively. In both years, the
expenses primarily related to employee severance, relocation, lease termination costs and other facilities-related
113Table of Contents

expenses. Total costs incurred under this plan were $36.8 million and $29.1 million in SG&A and R&D expenses, respectively. We do not expect to incur any
additional costs in connection with this plan.

As of December 31, 2010, we had indefinite-lived intangible assets of $29.5 million, which consisted of $26.6 million and $2.9 million of purchased IPR&D from
our acquisitions of CGI and CV Therapeutics, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded $136.0 million of impairment charges related to certain
IPR&D assets acquired from CV Therapeutics which we had no future plans to develop and which were deemed to have no future use to us or other market
participants. These charges related to the GS 9667, Adentri and tecadenoson programs and were recorded in R&D expense. The majority of the impairment charge
related to our GS 9667 program, a product candidate that was in Phase 1 clinical studies for the treatment of diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, which was terminated
in the fourth quarter of 2010 due to unfavorable results from pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics tests that demonstrated limited effectiveness of the compound
in patients. Given these results, we do not believe it has alternative future uses for us or other market participants. As of December 31, 2009, we had indefinite-lived
intangible assets of $138.9 million related to purchased IPR&D from our acquisition of CV Therapeutics.
10. COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS
As a result of entering into strategic collaborations from time to time, we may hold investments in non-public companies. We review our interests in our
investee companies for consolidation and/or appropriate disclosure based on applicable guidance. As disclosed in Note 1, we determined that certain of our investee
116Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
companies are variable interest entities; however, other than with respect to our joint ventures with BMS, we are not the primary beneficiary and therefore do not
consolidate these investees.
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
North America
In December 2004, we entered into a collaboration arrangement with BMS in the United States to develop and commercialize a single-tablet regimen containing
our Truvada and BMS’s Sustiva (efavirenz), which we sell as Atripla. The collaboration is structured as a joint venture and operates as a limited liability company
named Bristol-Myers Squibb & Gilead Sciences, LLC, which we consolidate. The ownership interests of the joint venture and thus the sharing of product revenue
and costs reflect the respective economic interests of BMS and Gilead and are based on the proportions of the net selling price of Atripla attributable to efavirenz and
Truvada. Since the net selling price for Truvada may change over time relative to the net selling price of efavirenz, both BMS’s and our respective economic interests
in the joint venture may vary annually.
We share marketing and sales efforts with BMS and both parties are obligated to provide equivalent sales force efforts for a minimum number of years. Starting
in the second quarter of 2011, except for a limited number of activities that will be jointly managed, the parties will no longer coordinate detailing and promotional
activities in the United States. The parties will continue to collaborate on activities such as manufacturing, regulatory, compliance and pharmacovigilance. We are
responsible for accounting, financial reporting, tax reporting, manufacturing and product distribution for the joint venture. Both parties provide their respective bulk
active pharmaceutical ingredients to the joint venture at their approximate market values. In July 2006, the joint venture received approval from the FDA to sell Atripla
in the United States. In September 2006, we and BMS amended the joint venture’s collaboration agreement to allow the joint venture to sell Atripla into Canada and in
October 2007, the joint venture received approval from Health Canada to sell Atripla in Canada. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the joint venture held efavirenz
active pharmaceutical ingredient which it purchased from BMS at BMS’s estimated net selling price of efavirenz in the U.S. market. These amounts are included in
inventories on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, total assets held by the joint venture were $1.45 billion and $1.40 billion,
respectively, and consisted primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable (including intercompany receivables with Gilead) and inventories. As of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, total liabilities held by the joint venture were $759.5 million and $1.03 billion, respectively, and consisted primarily of accounts payable
(including intercompany payables with Gilead) and other accrued expenses. These asset and liability amounts do not reflect the impact of intercompany eliminations
that are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although we are the primary beneficiary of the joint venture, the legal structure of the joint venture limits the
recourse that its creditors will have over our general credit or assets.
Europe
In December 2007, Gilead Sciences Limited (GSL), a wholly-owned subsidiary in Ireland, and BMS entered into a collaboration arrangement to commercialize
and distribute Atripla in the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland (collectively, the European Territory). The parties formed a limited
liability company which we consolidate, to manufacture Atripla for distribution in the European Territory using efavirenz that it purchases from BMS at BMS’s
estimated net selling price of efavirenz in the European Territory. We are responsible for product distribution, inventory management and warehousing. Through our
local subsidiaries, we have primary responsibility for order fulfillment, collection of receivables, customer relations and handling of sales returns in all the territories
where we co-promote Atripla with BMS. We are also responsible for accounting, financial reporting and tax reporting for the collaboration. In December 2007, the
117Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
European Commission approved Atripla for sale in the European Union. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, efavirenz purchased from BMS at BMS’s estimated net
selling price of efavirenz in the European Territory is included in inventories on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The parties also formed a limited liability company to hold the marketing authorization for Atripla in Europe. We have primary responsibility for regulatory
activities and we share marketing and sales efforts with BMS. In the major market countries, both parties have agreed to provide equivalent sales force efforts.
Revenue and cost sharing is based on the relative ratio of the respective net selling prices of Truvada and efavirenz.
PARI GmbH
As a result of our acquisition of Corus Pharma, Inc. (Corus) in August 2006, we assumed all rights to the February 2002 development agreement between Corus
and PARI GmbH (PARI) for the development of Cayston and development of an inhalation delivery device for this product. Under the terms of the agreement, we are
obligated to pay PARI for services rendered, and subject to the achievement of specific milestones, we are obligated to pay certain milestone payments to PARI. In
addition, we will make royalty payments based on net sales of Cayston. The agreement also provided us the right to reduce the royalty rate payable to PARI. In
November 2007, we paid PARI $13.5 million to reduce the royalty rate under the agreement. As Cayston had not yet been approved for commercialization at the time
of the payment, we recorded this payment in R&D expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Income. In April 2008, pursuant to the February 2002 development
agreement, we entered into a commercialization agreement with PARI which provides for the supply and manufacture of an inhalation delivery device and accessories
for use with Cayston. Under the terms of this agreement, we are obligated to pay royalties on future net sales of these products pursuant to the 2002 development
agreement.
In February 2010, we received marketing approval from the FDA for Cayston as a treatment to improve respiratory symptoms in CF patients with P.
aeruginosa. Cayston was conditionally approved in Europe and Canada in September 2009.
Parion Sciences, Inc.
In August 2007, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with Parion Sciences, Inc. (Parion) to research, develop and commercialize
certain epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) inhibitors for the treatment of pulmonary diseases. The agreement granted us worldwide commercialization rights to GS 9411
(formerly P-680), an ENaC inhibitor discovered by Parion, for the treatment of pulmonary diseases, including CF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and non-CF
bronchiectasis. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we paid a $5.0 million up-front license fee that was recorded in R&D expenses in our Consolidated
Statement of Income as there was no future alternative use for this technology, and made a $5.0 million investment in Parion in the form of convertible debt, which
was recorded as other noncurrent assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under the collaboration agreement, we will lead all development and commercialization
activities and provide funding of full time equivalent employees for certain research activities. In addition, we are obligated to make additional payments upon the
achievement of certain milestones and pay royalties on future net sales of products that are developed and approved in relation to this collaboration. In August 2010,
development of GS 9411 was terminated and the term of the research collaboration was extended to identify additional ENaC inhibitors for development.
Roche
In September 1996, we entered into a development and license agreement (the 1996 Agreement) with Roche to develop and commercialize therapies to treat and
prevent viral influenza. Tamiflu, an antiviral oral formulation
118Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
for the treatment and prevention of influenza, was co-developed by us and Roche. Under the 1996 Agreement, Roche has the exclusive right to manufacture and sell
Tamiflu worldwide, subject to its obligation to pay us a percentage of the net revenues that Roche generates from Tamiflu sales, which, in turn, has been subject to
reduction for certain defined manufacturing costs.
In November 2005, we entered into a first amendment and supplement to the 1996 Agreement with Roche. The amended agreement provided for the formation
of a joint manufacturing committee to review Roche’s manufacturing capacity for Tamiflu and its global plans for manufacturing Tamiflu, a U.S. commercial committee
to evaluate commercial plans and strategies for Tamiflu in the United States and a joint supervisory committee to evaluate Roche’s overall commercial plans for
Tamiflu on a global basis in each case, consisting of representatives of Roche and us. Under the amended agreement, we also have the option to provide a
specialized sales force to supplement Roche’s marketing efforts in the United States for Tamiflu.
The royalties payable to us on net sales of Tamiflu sold by Roche remain the same under the amended agreement, which are as follows: (a) 14% of the first
$200.0 million in worldwide net sales in a given calendar year; (b) 18% of the next $200.0 million in worldwide net sales during the same calendar year; and (c) 22% of
worldwide net sales in excess of $400.0 million during the same calendar year. The amended agreement revised the provision in the 1996 Agreement relating to the
calculation of royalty payments such that in any given calendar quarter Roche will pay royalties based on the actual royalty rates applicable to such quarter. In
addition, under the amended agreement, royalties payable by Roche to us will no longer be subject to a cost of goods sold adjustment that was provided in the 1996
Agreement. We recorded a total of $386.5 million, $392.7 million and $155.5 million of Tamiflu royalties in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
As a result of our acquisition of CV Therapeutics in April 2009, we assumed all rights to the agreement between CV Therapeutics and Roche under which we
have an exclusive worldwide license to Ranexa. Under the license agreement, we paid an initial license fee and are obligated to make certain payments to Roche upon
receipt of the first and second product approvals for Ranexa in any of the following major market countries: France, Germany, Italy, the United States and the United
Kingdom. In January 2006, we received FDA approval for Ranexa for the treatment of chronic angina and paid $11.0 million to Roche in accordance with the
agreement. In July 2008, we received marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) for Ranexa for the treatment of chronic angina in all 27
European Union member states and paid $9.0 million to Roche related to this approval. This amount was capitalized as a noncurrent asset on our Consolidated
Balance Sheet and is being amortized over its useful patent life, which is approximately 11 years, expiring in September 2019.
In June 2006, we entered into an amendment to the agreement with Roche related to Ranexa. This amendment provided us with exclusive worldwide commercial
rights to Ranexa for all potential indications in humans. Under the terms of the amendment, we made an upfront payment to Roche and are obligated to make royalty
payments to Roche on worldwide net product sales of any licensed products. In addition, we are obligated to make additional milestone payments upon the
achievement of certain regulatory approvals.
Japan Tobacco Inc.
In March 2005, Japan Tobacco Inc. (Japan Tobacco) granted us exclusive rights to develop and commercialize elvitegravir, a novel HIV integrase inhibitor
formerly known as GS 9137, in all countries of the world, excluding Japan, where Japan Tobacco retained such rights. Under the terms of the agreement, we incurred
an up-front license fee of $15.0 million which was included in R&D expenses in 2005 as there was no future alternative use for this technology. In March 2006, we
recorded $5.0 million in R&D expenses related to a
119Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
milestone we incurred as a result of dosing the first patient in a Phase 2 clinical study and in July 2008, we recorded $7.0 million in R&D expenses related to a
milestone we paid related to the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical study. We are obligated to make additional payments upon the achievement of other
milestones as well as pay royalties on any future product sales arising from this collaboration.
GlaxoSmithKline Inc.
In April 2002, we granted GSK the right to commercialize Hepsera, our oral antiviral for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, in Asia, Latin America and certain
other territories. Under the agreement, we retained rights to Hepsera in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Turkey. GSK received
exclusive rights to develop Hepsera solely for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in all of its territories, the most significant of which include China, Japan, South
Korea and Taiwan. GSK has full responsibility for the development and commercialization of Hepsera in its territories. Under the terms of the agreement, we received
an up-front license payment of $10.0 million and from 2002 to 2004, we received an aggregate of $17.0 million in milestone payments related to the commercial
approvals of Hepsera in various countries. In 2006, we received an aggregate of $10.0 million in milestone payments from GSK for the achievement by GSK of four
consecutive quarters of Hepsera gross sales exceeding $75.0 million and the achievement of a certain drug status in China. The up-front license fee and milestone
payments had been recorded as deferred revenue with a total of $3.4 million and $3.6 million being amortized into contract revenue in 2008 and 2007, respectively.
During the first quarter of 2009, we terminated our supply agreement with GSK to allow GSK to assume all manufacturing and supply obligations for Hepsera for use
in the GSK territories. As a result of the termination of this supply agreement, we recognized the remaining $24.5 million balance of deferred revenue into contract
revenue as of March 31, 2009. Under the terms of the agreement, GSK is also required to pay us royalties on net sales that GSK generates from sales of Hepsera and
Epivir-HBV/Zeffix (GSK’s hepatitis product) in the GSK territories. We recorded $48.0 million, $32.4 million and $31.7 million of royalty revenues in 2010, 2009 and
2008, respectively.
In November 2009, we entered into an agreement with GSK to commercialize Viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in five countries in Asia. Under the
agreement, we will retain exclusive rights for commercialization of Viread for chronic hepatitis B in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. In China, GSK
will have exclusive commercialization rights for Viread for chronic hepatitis B. Each company will pay royalties to the other on sales of Viread for chronic hepatitis B in
their respective Asian territories.
In September 2010, we granted GSK the exclusive right to commercialize tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for chronic hepatitis B in Japan. GSK will be required to
pay us royalties on sales of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for chronic hepatitis B in this territory.
As a result of our acquisition of Myogen, Inc. (Myogen) in November 2006, we assumed all rights to the March 2006 license and distribution and supply
agreements between Myogen and GSK. Under the terms of the license agreement, GSK has exclusive rights to market ambrisentan (the active pharmaceutical
ingredient in Letairis) under the name Volibris for PAH in territories outside the United States. We received an up-front payment of $20.0 million and, subject to the
achievement of specific milestones, we are eligible to receive total additional milestone payments of $80.0 million. In addition, we will receive royalties based on net
sales of Volibris in the GSK territories. GSK has an option to negotiate from us an exclusive sublicense for additional therapeutic uses for Volibris in the GSK
territories during the term of the license agreement. We will continue to conduct and bear the expense of all clinical development activities that we believe are required
to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for Letairis and Volibris in the United States, Canada and the European Economic Area, and each party may conduct
additional development activities in its territories at its own expense. The
120Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
parties may agree to jointly develop ambrisentan for new indications in the licensed field and each party will pay its share of external costs associated with such joint
development. In 2007, we received a milestone payment of $11.0 million from GSK for validation by the EMEA of the marketing authorization application for Volibris,
and in 2008, we received a $20.0 million milestone payment related to the European Commission marketing authorization approval for Volibris. The milestone and up-
front license payments have been recorded as deferred revenue and are being amortized into contract revenue over the remaining period for which we have
performance obligations under the agreement, which is approximately six years. We amortized $8.7 million, $8.3 million and $5.0 million to contract revenue in 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively.
Astellas US LLC and Astellas Pharma US, Inc. (Astellas), as applicable
As a result of our acquisition of CV Therapeutics in April 2009, we assumed all rights to the July 2000 collaboration agreement between CV Therapeutics and
Astellas US LLC to develop and market second generation pharmacologic MPI stress agents. Under this agreement, Astellas received exclusive North American
rights to Lexiscan and to a backup compound. In April 2008, we received FDA approval of Lexiscan for use as a pharmacologic stress agent in MPI studies in patients
unable to undergo adequate exercise stress. Under the terms of the agreement, the product is marketed by Astellas and was launched in June 2008 in the United
States. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recognized $43.2 million and $19.7 million, respectively, of royalty revenue from Astellas related to sales
of Lexiscan.
Since 1991, we have had an agreement with Astellas Pharma US, Inc. related to rights to market AmBisome. Under the terms of the agreement, Astellas is
responsible for promotion of AmBisome in the United States and Canada. We have exclusive marketing rights to AmBisome in the rest of the world, subject to our
obligation to pay royalties to Astellas in connection with sales in significant markets in Asia. We receive royalties from Astellas’ sales of AmBisome in the Unites
States and Canada. In connection with this agreement, we recorded royalty revenues of $10.2 million, $9.4 million and $9.5 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Tibotec Pharmaceuticals
In July 2009, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Tibotec Pharmaceuticals (Tibotec), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson,
to develop and commercialize a fixed-dose combination of our Truvada and Tibotec’s non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, TMC278 (25 mg rilpivirine
hydrochloride), for which we currently have a pending marketing application. In January 2011, we received a “refuse to file” notification from the U.S. FDA. In its
communication, the FDA requested additional information with respect to the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls section of the NDA submission. In February
2011, we re-filed our new drug application, which included the requested information, and are awaiting the FDA’s response as to whether it is substantially complete
to permit a substantive review. Under our license and collaboration agreement with Tibotec, we were granted an exclusive license to the combination product for
administration to adults in a once-daily, oral dosage form, worldwide excluding developing world countries and Japan. Neither party is restricted from combining its
drug products with any other drugs.
In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we will reimburse up to €71.5 million (approximately $100.0 million) of development costs incurred by Tibotec for
TMC278 through December 2011, and we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and formulate the combination product, including the
completion of bioequivalence studies. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we recorded €17.9 million (approximately $22.1 million) and €35.7 million
(approximately $52.4 million), respectively, in reimbursable R&D expenses incurred by Tibotec in the development of TMC278. Tibotec is required to use commercially
reasonable efforts to develop TMC278 and obtain its approval in the United States and Europe. We will
121Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
manufacture the combination product and assume the lead role in registration, distribution and, subject to regulatory approval, commercialization of the combination
product in the licensed countries. Tibotec will have the right to detail the combination product in the licensed countries, and, at its option, can request that it be the
distributor of the combination product in a limited number of such countries. The price of the combination product is expected to be the sum of the prices of the
Truvada and TMC278 components. We expect to recognize product sales revenue from future sales of the combination product if and when it is approved. The cost
of TMC278 to be purchased by us from Tibotec for the combination product will approximate the market price of TMC278, less a specified percentage of up to thirty
percent.

Total non-current convertible senior notes, net $ 2,838,573 $ 1,155,266
2011 and 2013 Notes
In April 2006, we issued $650.0 million of convertible senior notes due in 2011 (2011 Notes) and $650.0 million of convertible senior notes due in 2013 (2013
Notes) in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2011 Notes and the 2013 Notes were issued at par and bear
interest rates of 0.50% and 0.625%, respectively. Debt issuance costs of $23.8 million were recorded in other noncurrent assets and are being amortized to interest
expense over the contractual terms of the 2011 and 2013 Notes. The initial conversion rate for the 2011 Notes is 25.8048 shares per $1,000 principal amount of 2011
Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $38.75 per share), and the initial conversion rate for the 2013 Notes is 26.2460 shares per $1,000
principal amount of 2013 Notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $38.10 per share). The conversion rates are subject to customary anti-
dilution adjustments.
The 2011 and 2013 notes may be converted, subject to adjustment, only under the following circumstances: 1) during any calendar quarter beginning after
September 30, 2006 if the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days during the last 30 consecutive trading day period of the previous quarter is
more than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share, 2) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate
transactions occur, or 3) during the last month prior to maturity of the applicable notes. Upon conversion, a holder would receive an amount in cash equal to the
lesser of (i) the principal amount of the note or (ii) the conversion value for such note. If the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, we may also deliver, at
our option, cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common stock for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. If the 2011 and 2013 notes
are converted in connection with a change in control, we may be required to provide a make whole premium in the
122Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
form of an increase in the conversion rate, subject to a stated maximum amount. In addition, in the event of a change in control, the holders may require us to
purchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
Concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 and 2013 notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions at a cost of $379.1 million, which is tax
deductible over the life of the notes. We also sold warrants in private transactions and received net proceeds of $235.5 million from the sale of the warrants. The
convertible note hedges and warrants are intended to reduce the potential economic dilution upon future conversions of the 2011 and 2013 notes by effectively
increasing our conversion price to $50.80 per share for the 2011 Notes and $53.90 per share for the 2013 Notes. The net cost of $143.7 million of the convertible note
hedge and warrant transactions was recorded in stockholders’ equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The convertible note hedges cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, 33.8 million shares of our common stock at strike prices that initially
correspond to the initial conversion prices of the 2011 and 2013 notes and are subject to adjustments similar to those applicable to the conversion price of the related
notes. If the market value per share of our common stock at the time of conversion of the 2011 and 2013 notes is above the strike price of the applicable convertible
note hedges, we will be entitled to receive from the counterparties in the transactions shares of our common stock or, to the extent we have made a corresponding
election with respect to the related convertible notes, cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our option, for the excess of the market value
of the common stock over the strike price of the convertible note hedges. The convertible note hedges will terminate upon the maturity of the 2011 and 2013 notes or
when none of the 2011 and 2013 notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. There are 33.8 million shares of our common stock underlying the
warrants, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The warrants have strike prices of $50.80 per share (for the warrants expiring in 2011) and $53.90 per share
(for the warrants expiring in 2013) and are exercisable only on their respective expiration dates. If the market value of our common stock at the time of the exercise of
the applicable warrants exceeds their respective strike prices, we will be required to net settle in cash or shares of our common stock, at our option, with the
respective counterparties for the value of the warrants in excess of the warrant strike prices.
Contemporaneously with the closing of the sale of the 2011 and 2013 notes, a portion of the net proceeds from the notes’ issuance and the proceeds of the
warrant transactions were used to repurchase 16.7 million shares of our common stock for $544.9 million.
Under current accounting guidance, we bifurcated the conversion option of the 2011 and 2013 notes from the debt instrument, classified the conversion option
in equity and are accreting the resulting debt discount as interest expense. The following table summarizes information about the equity and liability components of
the 2011 and 2013 notes (in thousands):

For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recognized $67.9 million, $64.6 million and $61.5 million, respectively, in interest expense related to
the contractual coupon rates and amortization of the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
debt discount for the 2011 and 2013 notes. The effective interest rates on the liability components of the 2011 and 2013 notes were 5.7% and 5.8%, respectively. If the
notes were converted as of December 31, 2010, the if-converted value would not exceed the principal amounts of the 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes.
2014 and 2016 Notes
In July 2010, we issued $1.25 billion of convertible senior notes due in 2014 (2014 Notes) and $1.25 billion of convertible senior notes due in 2016 (2016 Notes)
in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2014 and 2016 notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of 1.00%
and 1.625%, respectively. Debt issuance costs are primarily comprised of $37.5 million in bankers’ fees, the majority of which were recorded in other noncurrent assets
and are being amortized to interest expense over the contractual terms of the 2014 and 2016 notes. The aggregate principal amount of the 2014 and 2016 notes sold
reflects the full exercise by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase additional notes to cover over-allotments. The initial conversion rate for the 2014 Notes is
22.1845 shares per $1,000 principal amount (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $45.08 per share), and the initial conversion rate for the 2016
Notes is 22.0214 shares per $1,000 principal amount (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $45.41 per share). The conversion rates are subject
to customary anti-dilution adjustments.
The 2014 and 2016 notes may be converted prior to April 1, 2014 and April 1, 2016, respectively, only under the following circumstances: 1) during any calendar
quarter commencing after September 30, 2010, if the closing price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of
30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is greater than 130% of the applicable conversion price on each
applicable trading day, or 2) during the five business day period after any measurement period of ten consecutive trading days in which, for each trading day of such
period, the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of Gilead common stock and the
applicable conversion rate on such trading day, or 3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions, such as the distribution of certain stock rights, cash
amounts, or other assets to all Gilead shareholders or the occurrence of a change in control. On and after April 1, 2014, in the case of the 2014 Notes, and April 1,
2016, in the case of the 2016 Notes, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Generally, upon conversion, a holder
would receive an amount in cash equal to the lesser of (i) the principal amount of the note or (ii) the conversion value for such note, as measured under the indenture
governing the relevant notes. If the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, we may also deliver, at our option, cash or common stock or a combination of
cash and common stock for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount. If the 2014 and 2016 notes are converted in connection with a change in control,
we may be required to provide a make whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate, subject to a stated maximum amount. In addition, in the event
of a change in control, the holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any.
Concurrent with the issuance of the 2014 and 2016 notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions at a cost of $362.6 million, which is tax
deductible over the life of the notes. We also sold warrants in private transactions and received net proceeds of $155.4 million from the sale of the warrants. The
convertible note hedges and warrants are intended to reduce the potential economic dilution upon future conversions of the 2014 and 2016 notes by effectively
increasing our conversion price to $56.76 per share for the 2014 Notes and $60.10 per share for the 2016 Notes. The net cost of $207.2 million of the convertible note
hedge and warrant transactions was recorded in stockholders’ equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The convertible note hedges cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, 55.3 million shares of our common stock at strike prices that initially
correspond to the initial conversion prices of the 2014 and 2016

notes and are subject to adjustments similar to those applicable to the conversion price of the related notes. If the market value per share of our common stock at the
time of conversion of the 2014 and 2016 notes is above the strike price of the applicable convertible note hedges, we will be entitled to receive from the counterparties
in the transactions shares of our common stock or, to the extent we have made a corresponding election with respect to the related convertible notes, cash or a
combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our option, for the excess of the market value of the common stock over the strike price of the convertible
note hedges. The convertible note hedges will terminate upon the maturity of the 2014 and 2016 notes or when none of the 2014 and 2016 notes remain outstanding
due to conversion or otherwise. There are 55.3 million shares of our common stock underlying the warrants, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The
warrants have strike prices of $56.76 per share (for the warrants expiring in 2014) and $60.10 per share (for the warrants expiring in 2016) and are exercisable only on
their respective expiration dates. If the market value of our common stock at the time of the exercise of the applicable warrants exceeds their respective strike prices,
we will be required to net settle in cash or shares of our common stock, at our option, with the respective counterparties for the value of the warrants in excess of the
warrant strike prices.
We have used and will continue to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes to repurchase shares of our common stock and repay
existing indebtedness.
Under current accounting guidance, we bifurcated the conversion option of the 2014 and 2016 notes from the debt instrument, classified the conversion option
in equity and are accreting the resulting debt discount as interest expense. The following table summarizes information about the equity and liability components of
the 2014 and 2016 notes (in thousands):

Total 2014 and 2016 convertible senior notes $ 259,535 $ 2,261,689 $ (238,311 )
For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $34.9 million in interest expense related to the contractual coupon rates and amortization of the debt
discount for the 2014 and 2016 notes. The effective interest rate on the liability components of the 2014 and 2016 notes was 3.5% and 4.0%, respectively. If the notes
were converted as of December 31, 2010, the if-converted value would not exceed the principal amounts of the 2014 Notes and 2016 Notes.
Credit Facility
Under our amended and restated credit agreement, we, along with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gilead Biopharmaceutics Ireland Corporation, may borrow up
to an aggregate of $1.25 billion in revolving credit loans. The credit agreement also includes a sub-facility for swing-line loans and letters of credit. Loans under the
credit agreement bear interest at an interest rate of either LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 20 basis points to 32 basis points or the base rate, as described in the
credit agreement. We may reduce the commitments and may prepay loans under the credit agreement in whole or in part at any time without penalty, subject to certain
conditions. The credit agreement will terminate in December 2012 and all unpaid borrowings thereunder shall be due and payable at that time. In April 2009, in
connection with the acquisition of CV Therapeutics, we borrowed $400.0 million under the credit agreement to partially fund the acquisition. As of December 31, 2009,
we had repaid the
125Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
$400.0 million under this credit agreement. In May 2010, we borrowed $500.0 million under the credit agreement to fund our stock repurchases. In August 2010, we
repaid the $500.0 million borrowed under this credit agreement using proceeds from our convertible senior notes issued in July 2010. As of December 31, 2010, we had
$5.0 million in letters of credit outstanding under the $1.25 billion credit agreement. We are required to comply with certain covenants under the credit agreement and
as of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all such covenants.
12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Lease Arrangements
We have entered into various long-term non-cancelable operating leases for equipment and facilities. We lease facilities in Foster City, Palo Alto and San
Dimas, California; Durham, North Carolina; Boulder, Colorado; Seattle, Washington; the Dublin and Cork areas of Ireland and the London area of the United
Kingdom. We also have operating leases for sales, marketing and administrative facilities in Europe, Canada and Asia Pacific. Our leases expire on various dates
between 2011 and 2029, with many of our leases containing options to renew. Certain facility leases also contain rent escalation clauses. Our most significant lease,
related to a facility in Seattle, Washington, expires in 2020 and has a 10-year term. The lease provides us with three consecutive rights to extend the term of the lease
through 2035 and contains an annual three percent rent escalation clause. The lease also requires us to pay additional amounts for operating expenses and
maintenance. We also have leases for three corporate aircraft, with varying terms, with renewal options upon expiration of the lease terms.
Lease expense under our operating leases was approximately $41.7 million, $37.3 million and $29.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
2008, respectively. Aggregate non-cancelable future minimum rental payments under operating leases are as follows (in thousands):
2011 $ 45,887
2012 37,733

Legal Proceedings
On August 12, 2009, we received a subpoena from the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services requesting
documents regarding the development, marketing and sales of Ranexa®. Ranexa is approved for the treatment of chronic angina and was developed and originally
commercialized by CV Therapeutics, a company that Gilead acquired in April 2009. Following receipt of the subpoena, we cooperated with the government’s inquiry.
On December 13, 2010, the United States Department of Justice notified the United States District Court for the Northern District of California “of its decision not to
intervene” in a False Claims Act lawsuit filed by a former employee of CV Therapeutics regarding the promotion of Ranexa. On December 16, 2010, the plaintiff-relator
filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the underlying lawsuit, and the United States consented to the dismissal without prejudice.
We are a party to various other legal actions that arose in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe that any of these other legal actions will
have a material adverse impact on our consolidated business, financial position or results of operations.

Other Commitments
In the normal course of business, we enter into various firm purchase commitments primarily related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory
related items. As of December 31, 2010, these commitments for the next five years were approximately $640.3 million in 2011, $149.3 million in 2012, $57.5 million in 2013,
$20.2 million in 2014 and $3.1 million in 2015. The amounts related to active pharmaceutical ingredients represent minimum purchase requirements. Actual payments
for the purchases related to these active pharmaceutical ingredients were $835.7 million, $1.03 billion and $1.04 billion during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
and 2008, respectively.
13. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Stock Repurchase Programs
In October 2007, our Board authorized a program for the repurchase of our common stock in an amount of up to $3.00 billion through open market and private
block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans or privately negotiated purchases or other means, including accelerated stock repurchase transactions or similar
arrangements. In 2007, we repurchased and retired 705,600 shares of our common stock at $46.28 per share for an aggregate of $32.7 million under the $3.00 billion
stock repurchase program.
In February 2008, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution to repurchase $500.0 million of our common stock on
an accelerated basis. Under the terms of this accelerated share repurchase agreement, we paid $500.0 million to the financial institution to settle the initial purchase
transaction and received 9,373,548 shares of our common stock at a price of $53.34 per share. In June 2008, upon maturity of the agreement and in accordance with the
share delivery provisions of the agreement, we received an additional 239,612 shares of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume weighted-
average prices of our common stock during a specified period less a predetermined discount per share. As a result, the average purchase price of our common stock
from the accelerated share repurchase was $52.01 per share.
We accounted for the accelerated share repurchase as two separate transactions: (a) as shares of common stock acquired in a treasury stock transaction
recorded on the transaction date and (b) as a forward contract indexed to our own common stock. As such, we accounted for the 9,373,548 shares that we received as
a repurchase of our common stock and retired those shares immediately for net income per share purposes. The 239,612 additional shares that we received upon
maturity of the contract in June 2008 were also recorded in stockholders’ equity. We determined that the forward contract indexed to our own common stock met all of
the applicable criteria for equity classification, and therefore, the contract was not accounted for as a derivative.
In October 2008, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution to repurchase $750.0 million of our common stock on an
accelerated basis. Under the terms of the accelerated share repurchase agreement, we paid $750.0 million to settle the initial purchase transaction and received
14,874,519 shares of our common stock at an initial price of $50.42 per share. In March 2009, upon termination of the agreement and in accordance with the share
delivery provisions of the agreement, we received an additional 1,356,337 shares of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume weighted-average
prices of our common stock during a specified period less a predetermined discount per share. As a result, the total number of shares repurchased and retired under
this accelerated share repurchase agreement was 16,230,856 shares at an average purchase price of $46.21 per share. The accounting for this accelerated share
repurchase was consistent with that of our previous accelerated share repurchase.
127Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
In 2008, in addition to the common stock repurchased under the two accelerated share repurchase transactions, we repurchased and retired 14,696,449 shares
of our common stock at an average purchase price of $48.94 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $719.3 million through open market transactions.
In 2009, in addition to the additional shares that we received under the accelerated share repurchase agreement completed in March 2009, we repurchased and
retired 21,845,929 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $45.69 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $998.1 million through open market
transactions. As of December 31, 2009, we completed share repurchases under our $3.00 billion stock repurchase program.
In January 2010, our Board authorized a new program for the repurchase of our common stock in an amount of up to $1.00 billion through open market and
private block transactions pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated purchases or other means. We completed this plan in May 2010, at which time our
Board authorized a new three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2010, we have repurchased $3.02 billion of our common stock under
this program. As of December 31, 2010, the remaining authorized amount of stock repurchases that may be made under our $5.00 billion repurchase program was $1.98
billion. In 2010, we utilized a total of $4.02 billion to repurchase and retire 109.9 million shares of our common stock, at an average purchase price of $36.57 per share.
In January 2011, our Board authorized an additional three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program which will commence upon the completion of our
existing program authorized in May 2010.
We use the par value method of accounting for our stock repurchases. Under the par value method, common stock is first charged with the par value of the
shares involved. The excess of the cost of shares acquired over the par value is allocated to APIC based on an estimated average sales price per issued share with
the excess amounts charged to retained earnings. As a result of our stock repurchases in 2008, we reduced common stock and APIC by an aggregate of $95.8 million
and charged $1.88 billion to retained earnings. As a result of our stock repurchases in 2009, we reduced common stock and APIC by an aggregate of $61.7 million and
charged $940.8 million to retained earnings. As a result of our stock repurchases in 2010, we reduced common stock and APIC by an aggregate of $319.8 million and
charged $3.71 billion to retained earnings.
Preferred Stock
We have 5,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock issuable in series. Our Board is authorized to determine the designation, powers, preferences and rights
of any such series. We have designated 800,000 shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for potential issuance under our November 1994 rights
agreement with BNY Mellon Investor Services, LLC (formerly known as ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, LLC), as amended (the Rights Plan). There was no
preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.
Rights Plan
The Rights Plan provides for the distribution of a preferred stock purchase right as a dividend for each share of our common stock. The purchase rights are not
currently exercisable. Under certain conditions involving an acquisition or proposed acquisition by any person or group of 15% or more of our common stock, the
purchase rights permit the holders (other than the 15% holder) to purchase our common stock at a 50% discount from the market price at that time, upon payment of a
specified exercise price per purchase right. In addition, in the event of certain business combinations, the purchase rights permit the purchase of the common stock of
an acquirer at a
128Table of Contents
GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.

50% discount from the market price at that time. Under certain conditions, the purchase rights may be redeemed by our Board in whole, but not in part, at a price of
$0.0025 per purchase right. The purchase rights have no voting privileges and are attached to and automatically trade with our common stock.
In October 1999, October 2003 and May 2006, our Board approved amendments to the Rights Plan. The first amendment provided, among other things, for an
increase in the exercise price of a right under the plan from $15 to $100 and an extension of the term of the plan from November 2004 to October 2009. The second
amendment provides, among other things, for an increase in the exercise price of a right under the plan from $100 to $400 and an extension of the term of the Rights
Plan to October 2013. The third amendment was a clarifying amendment entered into in connection with an increase in the designated number of shares of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock for potential issuance under the Rights Plan in May 2006.
Stock Option Plans
In May 2004, our stockholders approved and we adopted the Gilead Sciences, Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan). Stock options under the NeXstar
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NeXstar), Triangle Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Triangle), Corus, Myogen and CV Therapeutics stock option plans, which we assumed as a result of
the acquisitions of NeXstar, Triangle, Corus, Myogen and CV Therapeutics, have been converted into options to purchase our common stock effective with the
closing of the respective acquisitions. The 2004 Plan is a broad based incentive plan that allows for awards to be granted to our employees, directors and
consultants. The 2004 Plan provides for option grants designated as either non-qualified or incentive stock options. Prior to January 1, 2006, we granted both non-
qualified and incentive stock options, but all stock options granted after January 1, 2006 have been non-qualified stock options. Under the 2004 Plan, employee stock
options granted prior to 2011 generally vest over five years, are exercisable over a period not to exceed the contractual term of ten years from the date the stock
options are issued and are granted at prices not less than the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. Stock option exercises are settled with common
stock from the 2004 Plan’s previously authorized and available pool of shares.
In connection with the acquisition of CV Therapeutics, we assumed CV Therapeutics’ 1994 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, Non-Employee
Directors’ Stock Option Plan, as amended and restated, 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, 2000 Nonstatutory Incentive Plan, as amended and
restated, and 2004 Employee Commencement Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (collectively, the CV Therapeutics Plans). The majority of options that were
issued and outstanding under the CV Therapeutics Plans as of April 15, 2009 were converted into options to purchase approximately 1.8 million shares of our
common stock and remain subject to their original terms and conditions. There are no shares available for future grant under the CV Therapeutics Plans.
As of December 31, 2010, a total of 121,594,183 shares of common stock have been authorized for grant and 51,793,307 shares remain available for future grant
under the 2004 Plan.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $262.3 million, $379.8 million and $551.7 million,
respectively. The total fair value of stock options that vested during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $124.6 million, $162.9 million and
$169.2 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2010, the number of options outstanding that are expected to vest, net of estimated future option forfeitures was 13,302,022 with a
weighted-average exercise price of $43.12 per share, an aggregate intrinsic value of $9.6 million and a weighted-average remaining contractual life of 7.62 years. The
aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and stock options exercisable as of December 31, 2010 were $564.2 million and $554.0 million, respectively. As
of December 31, 2010, the weighted-average remaining contractual life for options outstanding and options exercisable were 5.3 and 4.5 years, respectively.
As of December 31, 2010, there was $260.8 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options, which is expected to be recognized over an
estimated weighted-average period of 2.7 years.
Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Awards
Under the 2004 plan, we grant performance-based restricted stock awards which vest upon the achievement of specified market and performance goals relative
to a pre-determined peer group. The actual number of common shares ultimately issued is calculated by multiplying the number of performance shares by a payout
percentage ranging from 0% to 200%. Performance shares vest only when a committee (or subcommittee) of our Board has determined that we have achieved our
specified market and performance goals. In January 2010, 2009 and 2008 we granted 412,505, 426,305 and 219,690 performance-based share awards (the 2010
performance shares, the 2009 performance shares and the 2008 performance shares, respectively). These awards will vest over a single three-year performance
measurement and vesting period for each of the performance share awards.
The fair value of each performance share grant is estimated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo valuation methodology. The weighted-average grant date fair
values of the 2010, 2009 and 2008 performance shares were
130Table of Contents

$54.25, $61.89 and $56.61 per share, respectively. We recognized $21.3 million, $14.9 million and $7.5 million of stock-based compensation expenses in 2010, 2009 and
2008, respectively, related to these performance shares.
We have also granted performance-based restricted stock awards to certain of our employees under the 2004 Plan. The vesting of these awards is subject to
the achievement of specified performance goals. The number of these awards issued to date has not been significant.
During 2010 we granted 2,189,903 time-based restricted stock awards to employees under the 2004 Plan. These awards vest annually over a five-year period.
We recognized $19.5 million of stock-based compensation expenses in 2010 related to time-based awards.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (ESPP), employees can purchase shares of our common stock based on a percentage of their
compensation subject to certain limits. The purchase price per share is equal to the lower of 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the offering date or
the purchase date. The ESPP offers a two-year look-back feature as well as an automatic reset feature that provides for an offering period to be reset to a new lower-
priced offering if the offering price of the new offering period is less than that of the current offering period. ESPP purchases are settled with common stock from the
ESPP’s previously authorized and available pool of shares. During 2010, 1,110,485 shares were issued under the ESPP for $32.3 million. A total of 33,280,000 shares of
common stock have been reserved for issuance under the ESPP, and there were 6,567,411 shares available for issuance under the ESPP as of December 31, 2010.
As of December 31, 2010, there was $22.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to the ESPP, which is expected to be recognized over an estimated
weighted-average period of 1.0 year.

inventory, respectively.
Stock-based compensation is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income using a graded vesting
expense attribution approach for unvested stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, and using the straight-line expense attribution approach for stock options
granted after
131Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
our adoption of new guidance for share-based payments to employees and directors on January 1, 2006. As stock-based compensation expenses related to stock
options recognized on adoption of the new guidance is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, gross expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The
guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We
estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience. Prior to the adoption of this guidance, pro forma information that was required to be disclosed included
forfeitures as they occurred. As a result of the guidance adopted on January 1, 2006, we only recognize a tax benefit from stock-based compensation in APIC if an
incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect
benefits of stock-based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the Consolidated Statements of Income rather than
through APIC.
Valuation Assumptions
Fair values of awards granted under our stock option plans and ESPP were estimated at grant or purchase dates using a Black-Scholes option valuation model.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility and expected award life.
We used the following assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of the awards:
Year Ended December 31,
2010 2009 2008
Expected volatility:
Stock options 31% 35% 34%
ESPP 35% 37% 31%
Expected term in years:
Stock options 5.4 5.3 5.3
ESPP 1.3 1.3 1.2
Risk-free interest rate:
Stock options 2.3% 2.1% 2.8%
ESPP 0.4% 0.7% 2.1%
Expected dividend yield 0% 0% 0%
The fair value of stock options granted was calculated using the single option approach. We use a blend of historical volatility along with implied volatility for
traded options on our common stock to determine our expected volatility. The expected term of stock-based awards represents the weighted-average period the
awards are expected to remain outstanding. We estimate the weighted-average expected term based on historical cancellation and historical exercise data related to
our stock options as well as the contractual term and vesting terms of the awards. The risk-free interest rate is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the
term of the stock-based awards. The dividend yield is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts.
15. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)
Comprehensive income (loss) comprises net income and certain changes in stockholders’ equity that are excluded from net income, such as changes in the fair
value of our outstanding effective cash flow hedges, changes in unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale securities and changes in our cumulative
foreign currency translation account. Comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and

The valuation allowance increased (decreased) by $11.9 million, $1.1 million and $(23.5) million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively. We have concluded, based on the standard set forth in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification related to Income Taxes, that it is more likely than
not that we will not realize any benefit from the deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating loss and credit carryforwards.
At December 31, 2010, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $732.5 million. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will
start to expire in 2016, if not utilized. We also had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately $26.2 million which will start to expire in 2016, if not utilized. In
addition, we had state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.40 billion and $3.3 million, respectively. The state net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards will start to expire in 2011 and 2016, respectively, if not utilized.
Utilization of net operating losses and tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided in the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. This annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating losses (NOLs) and credits before
utilization.
We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of
limitations is open for 2003 and onwards. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their NOLs
and credits carried over from prior years. For California income tax purposes, the statute of limitations remains open for 2002 and onwards.

Our income tax returns are audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for
the 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax years and by various state and foreign jurisdictions. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result,
significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax
jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions.
At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $126.5 million and $106.5 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax
benefits, $106.5 million and $72.6 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition.
We have continued to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax provision in our Consolidated Statements of
Income. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits of $12.3 million and $5.4 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2010, we believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $6.0 million in the next 12
months as we expect to have clarification from the tax authorities around certain of our uncertain tax positions. With respect to the remaining unrecognized tax
benefits, we are currently unable to make a reasonable estimate as to the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective tax authorities.

We maintain a retirement savings plan under which eligible employees may defer compensation for income tax purposes under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code (Gilead Plan). Under the Gilead Plan, employees may contribute up to 60% of their eligible annual compensation, subject to IRS plan limits. We make
matching contributions under the Gilead Plan. In 2010, 2009 and 2008, we contributed up to 50% of an employee’s contributions up to an annual maximum match of
$5,000. Our total matching contribution expense under the Gilead Plan for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $11.2 million, $10.2 million, and $7.8
million, respectively.
We maintain a deferred compensation plan under which our directors and key employees may defer compensation for income tax purposes. The deferred
compensation plan is a non-qualified deferred compensation

plan which is not subject to the qualification requirements under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Compensation deferred after December 31, 2004 is
subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the plan, officers and other senior grade level employees may contribute up to 70%
of their annual salaries and up to 100% of their annual bonus while directors may contribute up to 100% of their annual retainer fee. Amounts deferred by participants
are deposited in a rabbi trust and are recorded in other noncurrent assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Beginning in 2004, directors may also elect to receive
all or a portion of their annual cash retainer in phantom shares, which gives the participant the right to receive an amount equal to the value of a specified number of
shares over a specified period of time and which will be payable in shares of our common stock (with fractional shares paid out in cash) as established by the plan
administrator. As of December 31, 2010, we had 31,682 phantom shares outstanding. Participants can elect one of several distribution dates available under the plan at
which they will receive their deferred compensation payment.
19. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Stock Repurchase Program
In January 2011, our Board authorized an additional three-year, $5.00 billion stock repurchase program which will commence upon the completion of our
existing program authorized in May 2010.
Acquisition of Arresto Biosciences, Inc.
In December 2010, we entered into an agreement to acquire Arresto Biosciences, Inc. (Arresto) for $225 million plus potential future payments based on
achievement of certain sales levels. This transaction closed on January 14, 2011, at which time Arresto became a wholly-owned subsidiary. Arresto was a privately-
held, development-stage biotechnology company based in Palo Alto, California, focused on developing antibodies for the potential treatment of fibrotic diseases and
cancer. The company’s lead product is GS 6224 (formerly AB0024), a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the human lysyl oxidase-like-2 (LOXL2)
protein. In addition to an ongoing Phase 1 study of GS 6224 in patients with advanced solid tumors, a Phase 1 study had also been initiated to evaluate GS 6224 in
patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We believe that Arresto’s pipeline and research and development expertise are well aligned with Gilead’s areas of focus.
Given the timing of the closing of this acquisition, we are currently in the process of valuing the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the business combination.
As a result, we are unable to provide the amounts recognized as of the acquisition date for the major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and certain
disclosures pertaining to contingent consideration.
Acquisition of Calistoga Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
In February 2011, we entered into an agreement to acquire Calistoga Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Calistoga) for $375 million plus potential payments of up to $225
million based on the achievement of certain milestones. This transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2011. Calistoga is a privately-held,
biotechnology company based in Seattle, Washington, focused on the development of medicines to treat cancer and inflammatory diseases. The company has a
portfolio of proprietary compounds that selectively target isoforms of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (P13K). Calistoga’s lead product candidate, CAL-101, is a first-in-
class specific inhibitor of the P13K delta isoform. P13K delta is preferentially expressed in leukocytes involved in a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases
and hematological cancers.

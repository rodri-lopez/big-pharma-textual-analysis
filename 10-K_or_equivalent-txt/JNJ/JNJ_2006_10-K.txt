Item 1. BUSINESS
General
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries have approximately 122,200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field.
Johnson & Johnson has more than 250 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. Johnson & Johnson’s primary focus has been on products related to human health and well-
being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.
The Company’s structure is based on the principle of decentralized management. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the operations and
allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments. Each subsidiary
within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens of the country where it is located.
Segments of Business
Johnson & Johnson is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by
reference to the narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of segments and operating results under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” on
pages 38 through 49 and Note 11 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” under “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” on page 61 of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on
Form 10-K.
Consumer
The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby and kids care, skin care, oral care, wound care and women’s health care fields, as well as nutritional and over-the-counter
pharmaceutical products. Major brands include AVEENO® skin care products; BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages; CAREFREE® Pantiliners; CLEAN & CLEAR® teen skin care products; JOHNSON’S®
Baby and Adult lines of products; MOTRIN® IB ibuprofen products; NEUTROGENA® skin and hair care products; RoC® skin care products; PEPCID® AC Acid Controller from Johnson & Johnson • Merck
Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co.; REMBRANDT® Brand of oral care products; SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener; STAYFREE® sanitary protection products; and the broad family of TYLENOL® acetaminophen
products. These products are marketed principally to the general public and sold both to wholesalers and directly to independent and chain retail outlets throughout the world.
In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. comprising products related to self-medications for oral care, upper-respiratory
health, tobacco dependence, gastrointestinal health, skin care, eye care and hair growth. Major brands of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. include LISTERINE® oral care products, the
NICORETTE® line of smoking cessation treatments, and SUDAFED® cold, flu and allergy products.
Pharmaceutical
The Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following therapeutic areas: anti-fungal, anti-infective, cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology, gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, neurology,
oncology, pain management, psychotropic (central nervous system), urology and virology. These products are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for prescription use by the
general public. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: RISPERDAL® (risperidone) and RISPERDAL® CONSTA® (risperidone long-acting injection), for treatment of the symptoms of
schizophrenia; PROCRIT® (Epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as EPREX®), a biotechnology-derived product that stimulates red blood cell production; REMICADE® (infliximab), a monoclonal antibody therapy
indicated to treat the symptoms of Crohn’s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, chronic severe plaque psoriasis and use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; TOPAMAX®
(topiramate), an anti-epileptic and migraine prevention treatment; LEVAQUIN® (levofloxacin) and FLOXIN® (ofloxacin), both in the anti-infective field; DURAGESIC®/FentanylTransdermal (fentanyl transdermal system, sold outside the U.S. as DUROGESIC®), a treatment for chronic pain that offers a novel delivery system; ORTHO EVRA® (norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol
transdermal system), the first contraceptive patch approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN® LO (norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol), a low dose oral contraceptive;
CONCERTA® (methylphenidate HCl) a product for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; and NATRECOR® (nesiritide), a product for the treatment of patients with acutely decompensated
congestive heart failure who have dyspnea at rest or with minimal activity.
Medical Devices and Diagnostics
The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of products distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, therapists,
hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and clinics. These products include Cordis’ circulatory disease management products; DePuy’s orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal care products; Ethicon’s wound care and
women’s health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery’s minimally invasive surgical products; LifeScan’s blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics’ professional diagnostic
products and Vision Care’s disposable contact lenses. Distribution to these health care professional markets is done both directly and through surgical supply and other dealers.
Geographic Areas
The international business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by subsidiaries located in 56 countries outside the United States, which are selling products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The
products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “Business — Consumer,” “— Pharmaceutical” and “— Medical Devices and Diagnostics.” However, the
principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include not only those which were developed
in the United States, but also those which were developed by subsidiaries abroad.
Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive
economic policies and political uncertainties.
Raw Materials
Raw materials essential to Johnson & Johnson’s operating companies’ businesses are generally readily available from multiple sources.
Patents and Trademarks
Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of obtaining patent protection on its products and processes where possible. Johnson & Johnson owns or is licensed under a number of patents relating to its products
and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of its business. Sales of the Company’s two largest products, RISPERDAL®/RISPERDAL®
CONSTA® and PROCRIT®/EPREX®, accounted for approximately 8% and 6% of Johnson & Johnson’s total revenues, respectively, for fiscal 2006. Accordingly, the patents related to these products are believed
to be material to Johnson & Johnson as a whole.
During 2004, 2005 and 2006, DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl Transdermal (fentanyl transdermal system) lost its basic patent protection and is subject to generic competition in the United States and certain
international markets and EPREX® (Epoetin alfa) lost its basic patent protection and is subject to generic competition in international markets. DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl Transdermal sales declined by 18.3% to
$1.3 billion in 2006 as compared to 2005, due to the impact of generic competition. Regarding EPREX®, generic competition will be limited in the near term due to the lack of approved generic compounds.
Combined sales of DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl Transdermal and EPREX® accounted for approximately 5% of Johnson & Johnson’s worldwide sales in 2006. The only material patents scheduled to expire within the
next two years are related to
2RISPERDAL®, which is scheduled to expire in the United States in December 2007, and TOPAMAX®, which is scheduled to expire in the United States in September 2008. The Company has submitted data to
the FDA in order to obtain a pediatric extension for RISPERDAL®, which, if approved, would grant exclusivity in the United States through June 2008. The TOPAMAX® patent also carries the possibility of a
pediatric extension in the United States, which, if obtained, would grant exclusivity in the United States until March 2009.
Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of selling its products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. Johnson & Johnson’s trademarks are protected by
registration in the United States and other countries where its products are marketed. Johnson & Johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its business.
Seasonality
Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions,
principally for advertising and research grants.
Competition
In all of their product lines, Johnson & Johnson companies compete with companies both large and small, located throughout the world. Competition is strong in all product lines without regard to the number
and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development
of new and improved products is important to Johnson & Johnson’s success in all areas of its business. This competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and multiple sales
forces. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer acceptance of the products of Johnson & Johnson’s consumer businesses involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
Research and Development
Research activities represent a significant part of Johnson & Johnson’s business. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States but also in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China,
France, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom. The costs of worldwide Company-sponsored research activities relating to the development of new products, improvement of
existing products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of consumers and patients, excluding in-process research and development charges, amounted to
$7,125 million, $6,462 million and $5,344 million for fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These costs are charged directly to income in the year in which incurred.
Environment
Johnson & Johnson companies are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental protection measures. Johnson & Johnson believes that its operations comply in all material respects with
applicable environmental laws and regulations. Johnson & Johnson’s compliance with these requirements did not, during the past year, and is not expected to, have a material effect upon its capital expenditures,
cash flows, earnings or competitive position.
Regulation
Most of Johnson & Johnson’s business is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent
regulation. In the United States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy,
manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the FDA continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA
clearance of new drugs and devices
3and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the United States.
The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the United States, attention
has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more
potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care. In the United
States, implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 may cause uncertainty in reimbursement levels in certain product
segments.
The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson & Johnson companies operate have administrative powers that may subject those companies to such actions as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of
products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, Johnson & Johnson’s operating companies may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.
In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations
and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.

Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.
The Company or its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and
comparable state laws, in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and future remediation. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in the opinion of the Company,
such proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.

Item 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto and the material captioned “Report of Independent Registered

Not applicable.
8Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, and Dominic J. Caruso, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Weldon and Caruso concluded that, as of the date of their
evaluation, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Internal Control. Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included in this Report on Form 10-K in this Item 9A. During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2006, there were
no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria
established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework.” These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk
assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its
internal controls over financial reporting.
On December 20, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. Due to the close proximity of the completion date of the acquisition to the date of
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, management excluded the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. from its assessment of internal
control over financial reporting.
The total assets of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc., which were primarily intangible assets and goodwill, represented 26% of the Company’s total assets for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2006.
9The operating results of the Consumer Healthcare business acquired from Pfizer Inc. on December 20, 2006 will be reported in the Company’s financial statements beginning in 2007, as 2006 results
subsequent to the acquisition date were not significant.
Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2006, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears in the “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” on page 77 of the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference and
filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.
Item 9B. OTHER INFORMATION

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Organization and Business Segments
Description of the Company and Business Segments
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) have approximately 122,200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in
the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus has been on products related to human health and well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby and
kids care, skin care, oral care, wound care and women’s health care fields, as well as nutritional and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. These products are marketed principally to the general public and
sold both to wholesalers and directly to independent and chain retail outlets throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following therapeutic areas: anti-fungal, anti-infective,
cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology, gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management, psychotropic (central nervous system), urology and virology areas. These products
are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for prescription use by the general public. The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of products used
principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and clinics. These products include Cordis’ circulatory disease management products; DePuy’s orthopaedic
joint reconstruction and spinal care products; Ethicon’s wound care and women’s health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery’s minimally invasive surgical products; LifeScan’s blood glucose monitoring and insulin
delivery products; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics’ professional diagnostic products and Vision Care’s disposable contact lenses.
The Company’s structure is based upon the principle of decentralized management. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the operations and
allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments. Each subsidiary
within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens of the country where it is located.
In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both large and small, located throughout the world. Competition is strong in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the
competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and
improved products is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. This also includes protecting the Company’s portfolio of intellectual property. The competitive environment requires
substantial investments in continuing research and multiple sales forces. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer acceptance of the Company’s consumer products involves significant
expenditures for advertising and promotion.
Management’s Objectives
A primary objective of the Company is to achieve superior levels of capital efficient profitable growth. To accomplish this, the Company’s management operates the business consistent with certain strategic
principles that have proven successful over time. To this end, the Company participates in growth areas in human health care and is committed to attaining leadership positions in these growth segments through
the development of innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for over 30% of 2006 sales. In 2006, $7.1 billion, or 13.4% of sales was invested in research and
development, an increase of $0.7 billion over 2005. This increase reflects management’s commitment to the importance of on-going development of new and differentiated products and services to sustain long
term growth.
With more than 250 operating companies located in 57 countries, the Company views its principle of decentralized management as an asset and fundamental to the success of a broadly based business. It also
fosters an entrepreneurial spirit, combining the extensive resources of a large organization with the ability to react quickly to local market changes and challenges.
The Company is committed to developing global business leaders who can drive growth objectives. Businesses are managed for the long term in order to sustain leadership positions and achieve growth that
provides an enduring source of value to our shareholders.Unifying the management team and the Company’s dedicated employees in achieving these objectives is Our Credo. Our Credo provides a common set of values and serves as a constant reminder of the
Company’s responsibilities to its customers, employees, communities and shareholders. The Company believes that these basic principles, along with its overall mission of improving the quality of life for people
everywhere, will enable Johnson & Johnson to continue to be among the leaders in the health care industry.
Results of Operations
Analysis of Consolidated Sales
In 2006, worldwide sales increased 5.6% to $53.3 billion, compared to increases of 6.7% in 2005 and 13.1% in 2004. These sales increases consisted of the following:
Sales increase due to: 2006 2005 2004
Volume 3.8% 5.4 8.7
Price 1.5 0.6 1.0
Currency 0.3 0.7 3.4
Total 5.6% 6.7 13.1
Sales by U.S. companies were $29.8 billion in 2006, $28.4 billion in 2005, and $27.7 billion in 2004. This represents an increase of 4.9% in 2006, 2.2% in 2005, and 9.9% in 2004. Sales by international
companies were $23.5 billion in 2006, $22.1 billion in 2005, and $19.6 billion in 2004. This represents an increase of 6.4% in 2006, 13.1% in 2005, and 18.0% in 2004.

The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 10.5%, 8.5% and 13.5%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and
international sales were 9.6%, 10.6% and 8.4%, respectively.
(GRAPH)
All international geographic regions experienced sales growth during 2006, consisting of 4.9% in Europe, 14.7% in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) and 5.2% in the Asia-Pacific, Africa regions.
These sales increases include the impact of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies which had positive impacts of 0.5% in Europe, 5.4% in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the
U.S.) and a negative impact of 1.4% in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region.
In 2006 and 2005, the Company did not have a customer that represented 10% or more of total revenues. In 2004, sales to Cardinal Health and McKesson accounted for 10.2% and 10.0% of total revenues,
respectively.
2004 results benefited from the inclusion of a 53rd week. (See Note 1 for Annual Closing Date details.) The Company estimated that the fiscal fourth quarter growth rate in 2004 was enhanced by
approximately 2% and the year by approximately 0.5%. The net earnings impact of the additional week in 2004 was negligible.

Analysis of Sales by Business Segments
Consumer Segment
Consumer segment sales in 2006 were $9.8 billion, an increase of 7.5%, over 2005 with operational growth accounting for 6.4% of the total growth and 1.1% due to positive currency fluctuations.
U.S. Consumer segment sales were $4.6 billion, an increase of 3.8%. International sales were $5.2 billion, an increase of 10.9%, with 8.7% as a result of operations and 2.2% due to currency fluctuations over
2005.
Consumer segment sales growth in 2006 was led by strong sales performance in the Skin Care and Baby & Kids Care franchises. The 2006 Over-the-Counter (OTC) Pharmaceuticals and Nutritionals franchise
sales were $2.7 billion, an increase of 2.4% from 2005. This growth was led by the success of the re-launch of the TYLENOL® Upper Respiratory product line with products containing phenylephrine instead of
pseudoephedrine, as well as growth in SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweeteners. This was partially offset by sales declines in adult analgesics. The Skin Care franchise sales in 2006 were $2.6 billion, representing an
increase of 9.7% over 2005. This was attributable to sales growth in the AVEENO®, JOHNSON’S® adult, suncare, and the newly acquired Groupe Vendôme adult skin care product lines. The Baby & Kids Care
franchise sales grew by 11.5% to $1.7 billion in 2006. This strong growth was led by the success of powder product lines in international markets, as well as cleanser, lotion and cream product lines in both U.S.

and international markets. The Women’s Health franchise sales grew by 6.3% to $1.7 billion in 2006 resulting from solid contributions from the K-Y® and STAYFREE® product lines. Sales in all other franchises
grew by 11.8% to $1.0 billion in 2006. This was primarily due to the acquisition of the REMBRANDT® Brand of oral care products.
The operating results of the Consumer Healthcare business acquired from Pfizer Inc. on December 20, 2006 will be reported in the Company’s financial statements beginning in 2007, as 2006 results
subsequent to the acquisition date were not significant.
Consumer segment sales in 2005 were $9.1 billion, an increase of 9.2%, over 2004 with operational growth accounting for 7.8% of the total growth and 1.4% due to positive currency fluctuations.
U.S. Consumer segment sales were $4.4 billion, an increase of 4.3%. International sales were $4.7 billion, an increase of 14.2%, with 11.3% as a result of operations and 2.9% due to currency fluctuations over
2004.
Consumer segment sales in 2004 were $8.3 billion, an increase of 12.1% over 2003, with operational growth accounting for 8.8% of the total growth, and 3.3% due to a positive currency impact. U.S. sales
increased by 6.5% while international sales increased by 18.7%, with 11.5% due to operational gains and a positive currency impact of 7.2% over 2003.
Pharmaceutical Segment
Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2006 were $23.2 billion, an increase of 4.2% over 2005, with 3.9% of this change due to operational growth and the remaining 0.3% increase related to the positive impact of
currency. U.S. Pharmaceutical segment sales were $15.1 billion, an increase of 4.2%. International Pharmaceutical segment sales were $8.1 billion, an increase of 4.2%, which included 3.4% of operational growth
and 0.8% related to the positive impact of currency.
RISPERDAL® (risperidone), a medication that treats the symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar mania, and RISPERDAL® CONSTA® (risperidone) long acting injection that treats the symptoms of
schizophrenia, achieved $4.2 billion in sales in 2006, an increase of 17.8% over prior year. Sales growth was positively impacted by lower rebates for RISPERDAL® and higher demand for RISPERDAL®
CONSTA®. U.S. sales of RISPERDAL® and RISPERDAL® CONSTA® increased by 24.3% to $2.4 billion, while international sales increased by 9.9% to $1.8 billion. In October of 2006, the Company received
approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market RISPERDAL® for the treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder in children and adolescents. The RISPERDAL® compound
patent is scheduled to expire in the U.S. in December 2007. The Company has submitted pediatric data to the FDA in order to extend exclusivity through June 2008. The expiration of a product patent typically
results in a loss of market exclusivity and can result in a significant reduction in sales.
PROCRIT® (Epoetin alfa) and EPREX® (Epoetin alfa) had combined sales of $3.2 billion in 2006, a decline of 4.3% compared to prior year. PROCRIT® experienced a sales decline of 8.1% in 2006 due to a
competitor’s anticompetitive contracting strategy in oncology clinics. EPREX® sales increased by 3.5% in 2006. The approval of the once weekly administration and the recent restoration to the label of
subcutaneous administration for EPREX® in Europe resulted in volume gains. Although the EPREX® patent has expired in most major European markets, no erythropoietin product has been approved using the
biosimilar regulatory pathway. Several companies have made filings using the pathway and their filings are under review. The Company cannot predict when such products may be approved.
REMICADE® (infliximab), a biologic approved for the treatment of Crohn’s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis and use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, achieved sales
of $3.0 billion in 2006, with growth of 18.9% over prior year. Continued growth was driven by increased demand due to expanded indications. During the fiscal third quarter of 2006, REMICADE® received FDA
approval for the treatment of adults with chronic severe plaque psoriasis.
TOPAMAX® (topiramate), which has been approved for adjunctive and monotherapy use in epilepsy, as well as for the prophylactic treatment of migraines, achieved $2.0 billion in sales in 2006, an increase
of 20.7% over prior year. The migraine indication was the key driver of 2006 sales growth.
LEVAQUIN® (levofloxacin) and FLOXIN® (ofloxacin) achieved combined sales of $1.5 billion in 2006, representing growth of 2.5% over prior year. This growth was achieved despite a lack of growth in the
market.
DURAGESIC®/ Fentanyl Transdermal (fentanyl transdermal system) sales declined to $1.3 billion in 2006, a reduction of 18.3% from 2005. This decline was the result of the impact of generic competition in
the U.S. and certain international markets. Generic competition in the U.S. began in January 2005.The hormonal contraceptive franchise sales declined to $1.0 billion in 2006, a reduction of 10.6% from 2005. ORTHO

EVRA® (norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol), the first contraceptive patch approved by the FDA, experienced a significant decline in sales as a result of labeling changes and negative media coverage concerning
product safety. The sales decline was also a result of continued generic competition in oral contraceptives. Growth in ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN® LO (norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol), a low dose oral contraceptive
partially offset the sales decline in the hormonal contraceptive franchise.
CONCERTA®(methylphenidate HCl), a product for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, achieved sales of $0.9 billion in 2006, representing an increase of 20.2% over 2005. Although the
original CONCERTA® patent expired in 2004, two new CONCERTA® patents have been issued which expire in 2017. At present, the FDA has not approved any generic version that is substitutable for
CONCERTA®. Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) for generic versions of CONCERTA® are pending and may be approved at any time.
NATRECOR® (nesiritide), a product for the treatment of patients with acutely decompensated congestive heart failure who have dyspnea at rest or with minimal activity, has experienced a significant decline
in demand due to negative media coverage regarding a meta analysis of selected historical clinical trials. The Company believes that the data does not support the conclusions of these medical and consumer
publications and the currently approved label for NATRECOR® reflects all available data to date.
NATRECOR® was purchased by the Company in 2003 and resulted in the recording of an intangible asset, which is being amortized over 12 years. The remaining unamortized intangible value associated
with NATRECOR® was $1.0 billion at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006, and based on the current estimate of projected future cash flows, no adjustment to this intangible asset is required. The Company
is currently conducting several clinical trials for NATRECOR®, the outcomes of which cannot be predicted and may impact the projections of future cash flows.
During 2006, the Company received FDA approval for PREZISTATM (darunavir), an anti-HIV medication, and INVEGATM (paliperidone) Extended-Release Tablets, a new atypical antipsychotic, for the
treatment of schizophrenia. Additionally, IONSYSTM (fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system), the first needle-free, patient-activated analgesic system received FDA and European Commission approval.
JURNISTATM prolonged-release tablets (Hydromorphone HCl), a new prescription treatment for severe pain, received approval through the European Mutual Recognition Procedure in 2006.
Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2005 were $22.3 billion, an increase of 0.9% over 2004, with 0.4% of this change due to operational growth and the remaining 0.5% increase related to the positive impact of
currency. U.S. Pharmaceutical segment sales decreased 3.2% while international Pharmaceutical segment sales increased 9.4%, which included 7.8% of operational growth and 1.6% related to the positive impact
of currency.
Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2004 were $22.1 billion, an increase of 13.4% over 2003, with 10.7% due to operational growth and 2.7% due to positive currency fluctuations. U.S. Pharmaceutical segment
sales increased by 12.7% while international Pharmaceutical segment sales grew 14.8% over 2003. This included operational growth of 6.4% and 8.4% related to the positive impact from currency.
Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2005 and 2004 included a benefit from adjustments related to previously estimated performance based rebate allowances and managed care contracts. These adjustments were
less than 1.0% of sales in both 2005 and 2004.
Medical Devices and Diagnostics Segment
The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment achieved sales of $20.3 billion in 2006, representing an increase over the prior year of 6.2%, with operational growth of 6.4% and a negative impact from
currency of 0.2%. U.S. sales were $10.1 billion, an increase of 6.5%. International sales were $10.2 billion, an increase of 5.9%, with 6.2% from operations and a negative currency impact of 0.3%.
The DePuy franchise achieved $4.1 billion in sales in 2006, which was a 6.7% increase over prior year. This growth was primarily due to DePuy’s orthopaedic joint reconstruction products, Mitek sports
medicine products and the trauma business. The acquisitions of Future Medical Systems S.A. and Hand Innovations LLC also contributed to this growth.
The Cordis franchise achieved sales of $4.1 billion in 2006, an increase of 2.6% over 2005. Sales of the CYPHER® Sirolimus-eluting Stent, the largest product in the Cordis franchise, were relatively flat. The
relatively modest growth in CYPHER® Sirolimus-eluting Stent sales was caused by lower average selling prices, negative media and a regulatory focus concerning drug eluting stents and the corresponding lack
of market growth. There were strong performances by the Biosense Webster and endovascular businesses in 2006. During the fiscal third quarter of 2006, the Company received FDA approval to market the
PRECISE® Nitinol Stent and the ANGIOGUARDTM Emboli Capture Guidewire to treat carotid artery disease. In addition, the Company received CE MarkMajor Medical Devices and Diagnostics Franchise Sales*:

In April and July of 2004, the Cordis Cardiology Division of Cordis Corporation received Warning Letters from the FDA regarding Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and Good Clinical Practice
regulations. In response to the Warning Letters, Cordis has made improvements to its quality systems and has provided periodic updates to the FDA. The Clinical Warning Letter issues have been resolved to the
FDA’s satisfaction. With respect to the Quality System Warning Letter, in addition to the improvement updates, the Cordis Juarez, Mexico and stent supplier locations were inspected with acceptable results. The
FDA inspected the Miami site and the Global Quality System, including Design Control system, in August 2006, with acceptable results; Cordis received no observations from the FDA during this inspection. The
FDA inspections were completed in Cordis LLC in San German, Puerto Rico and Cordis laboratory operations in Warren, New Jersey in January 2007, thereby completing all scheduled follow up inspections.
Cordis is in the process of evaluating and reviewing the overall results of the inspections with the FDA.
The Ethicon Endo-Surgery franchise achieved sales of $3.4 billion in 2006, an 8.7% increase over 2005. A major contributor of growth continues to be endocutter sales, which include products used in
performing bariatric procedures for the treatment of obesity, an important focus area for the franchise. Strong results were achieved with the success of the HARMONIC SCALPEL®, an ultrasonic cutting and
coagulating surgical device, which received approval in January 2006 for expanded indications to include plastic surgery. There was also strong growth in advanced sterilization products.
The Ethicon franchise sales grew 3.9% in 2006, reaching $3.2 billion. This was a result of solid growth in mesh and women’s health and urology products. Sales of both GYNECARE® products and
DERMABOND® had strong results in 2006. There was also continued growth in suture sales.
The LifeScan franchise achieved $2.1 billion in sales in 2006, an increase of 8.6% over 2005. Animas Corporation, which was acquired in the fiscal first quarter of 2006, provided LifeScan with a platform for
entry into the insulin pump segment of the diabetes market, was a key contributor to this growth. Strong performance was also achieved in the ONETOUCH® ULTRA® product line in both U.S. and international
markets.
Sales in the Vision Care franchise reached $1.9 billion in 2006, a growth rate of 10.9% over the prior year. This growth was led by the global success of ACUVUE® OASYSTM Brand Contact Lenses with
HYDRACLEARTM PLUS and ACUVUE® ADVANCETM for ASTIGMATISM and the international success of 1-DAY ACUVUE® MOISTTM and ACUVUE® DEFINE.TM
The Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics franchise achieved $1.5 billion in sales in 2006, a 5.7% increase over 2005. Growth was achieved in clinical laboratory and immunohematology sales in both the U.S. and
international markets.
The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment achieved sales of $19.1 billion in 2005, representing an increase over the prior year of 13.1%, with operational growth of 12.5% and a positive impact from
currency of 0.6%. U.S. sales increased 10.6% while international sales increased 15.7%, with 14.5% from operations and 1.2% from currency.
In 2004, the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment achieved sales of $16.9 billion, representing an increase over the prior year of 13.2% with operational growth of 9.0% and a positive impact from
currency of 4.2%. U.S. sales increased 6.9% while international sales increased 20.7%, with 11.4% from operations and 9.3% from currency.
Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income
Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income increased to $14.6 billion, or 11.2%, over the $13.1 billion earned in 2005. The increase in 2005 was 6.4% over the $12.3 billion in 2004. As a
percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income in 2006 was 27.4% which was an improvement of 1.4% from 2005. There was no change as a percent to sales between 2005 and 2004.
For 2004, the improvement was 2.7% over the 23.3% in 2003. The sections that follow highlight the significant components of the changes in consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income.
Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows:
2006 2005 2004
% of SalesCost of products sold 28.2% 27.7 28.5
Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year 0.5 (0.8) (0.7)
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses 32.7 34.1 34.2
Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year (1.4) (0.1) (0.3)
In 2006, there was an increase in the percent to sales of cost of products sold. This was due to unfavorable product mix and higher manufacturing costs in the Pharmaceutical and Consumer segments. There
was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2006. This was a result of leveraging selling expenses and a reduction in advertising and promotional spending. During
2006, the Company continued to focus on controlling expenses.
In 2005, there was a decrease in the percent to sales of cost of products sold. This was due to lower manufacturing costs primarily related to the CYPHER® Sirolimus-eluting Stent, as well as ongoing cost
containment activity across the organization, partially offset by the negative impact of pharmaceutical product mix. There was also a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative
expenses. This was due to cost containment initiatives in the Pharmaceutical segment partially offset by increases in investment spending in the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment.
In 2004, there was a decrease in the percent to sales of cost of products sold. This was due to favorable mix, as well as cost improvement initiatives. There was also a decrease in the percent to sales of selling,
marketing and administrative expenses. This was due to the Company’s focus on managing expenses, partially offset by an increase in investment spending across a number of businesses focused on driving future
growth.

Research and Development: Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company’s business. These expenditures relate to the development of new products, improvement of
existing products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of consumers and patients. Worldwide costs of research activities, excluding in-process research
and development charges, were as follows:

Research and development expense $7,125 6,462 5,344
Percent increase over the prior year 10.3% 20.9 10.6
Percent of sales 13.4% 12.8 11.3
Research and development expense as a percent of sales for the Pharmaceutical segment was 21.3% for 2006, 20.2% for 2005, and 16.7% for 2004. Combined research and development expense as a percent
to sales in the Consumer and Medical Devices and Diagnostics segments were 7.2%, 6.9%, and 6.5% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Research and development activities accelerated in the Pharmaceutical segment, increasing to $5.0 billion, or 9.9%, over 2005. The compound annual growth rate was approximately 14.6% for the five-year
period since 2001.
The increased investment in research and development in all segments, demonstrates the Company’s focus on knowledge based products, and reflects a significant number of projects in late stage
development.
In-Process Research and Development: In 2006, the Company recorded in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges of $559 million before tax related to the acquisitions of the Consumer
Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc., Vascular Control Systems, Inc., Ensure Medical, Inc., ColBar LifeScience Ltd., Hand Innovations LLC and Future Medical Systems S.A. The Consumer Healthcare business of
Pfizer Inc. accounted for $320 million before tax of the IPR&D charges and was included in the operating profit of the Consumer segment. The IPR&D charges for all of the following acquisitions were included
in the operating profit of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment. Vascular Control Systems, Inc., a privately held company focused on developing medical devices to treat fibroids and to control bleeding in
obstetric and gynecologic applications, accounted for $87 million before tax of the IPR&D charges. Ensure Medical, Inc., a privately held company that develops devices for post-catheterization closure of the
femoral artery, accounted for $66 million before tax of the IPR&D charges. ColBar LifeScience Ltd., a privately held company specializing in reconstructive medicine and tissue engineering, accounted for
$49 million before tax of the IPR&D charges. Hand Innovations LLC, a privately held manufacturer of fracture fixation products for the upper extremities, accounted for $22 million before tax of the IPR&D
charges. Future Medical Systems S.A., a privately held company that primarily develops, manufactures and markets arthroscopic fluid management systems, accounted for $15 million before tax of the IPR&D
charges.
In 2005, the Company recorded IPR&D charges of $362 million before tax related to the acquisitions of TransForm Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Closure Medical Corporation, Peninsula Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and
the international commercial rights to certain patents and know-how in the field of sedation and analgesia from Scott Lab, Inc. TransForm Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a company specializing in the discovery of superior
formulations and novel crystalline forms of drug molecules, accounted for $50 million before tax of the IPR&D charges and was included in the operating profit of the Pharmaceutical segment. Closure Medical
Corporation, a company with expertise and intellectual property in the biosurgicals market, accounted for $51 million before tax of the IPR&D charges and was included in the operating profit of the Medical
Devices and Diagnostics segment. Peninsula Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing antibiotics to treat life-threatening infections, accounted for
$252 million before tax of the IPR&D charges and was included in the operating profit of the Pharmaceutical segment. The $9 million before tax IPR&D charge related to Scott Lab, Inc. referred to above was
included in the operating profit of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment.
In 2004, the Company recorded IPR&D charges of $18 million before tax as a result of the acquisition of U.S. commercial rights to certain patents and know-how in the field of sedation and analgesia from
Scott Lab, Inc. This charge was included in the operating profit of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment.
Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net includes gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Development
Corporation, gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment, currency gains and losses, minority interests, litigation settlements and liabilities and royalty income. The change in other (income)
expense, net from 2006 to 2005 was an increase in income of $457 million.In 2006, other (income) expense, net included the gain associated with the Guidant acquisition agreement termination fee, less associated expenses, of $622 million. Other (income) expense, net also included
royalty income partially offset by expenses associated with the recording of additional product liability reserves and the integration costs associated with the acquisition of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare.
In 2005, other (income) expense, net included royalty income partially offset by several expense items, none of which were individually significant.
In 2004, other (income) expense, net included several expense items, none of which were individually significant, partially offset by royalty income.

(GRAPH)
Consumer Segment: Consumer segment operating profit in 2006 decreased 13.7% from 2005. As a percent to sales, 2006 operating profit declined to 14.1% resulting from $320 million of IPR&D expenses
as well as expenses associated with the Pfizer Consumer Healthcare integration recorded during 2006. Consumer segment operating profit in 2005 increased 10.2% over the prior year. As a percent to sales, 2005
operating profit increased slightly to 17.5%, despite increases in investment spending in advertising and research and development.
Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2006, Pharmaceutical segment operating profit increased 8.3% and as a percent to sales increased to 29.6%. This increase was the result of $302 million of IPR&D recorded
during 2005 partially offset by increases in research and development spending and lower gross margins in 2006. In 2005, Pharmaceutical segment operating profit decreased 13.7%, and as a percent to sales
declined 4.8% from 2004 to 28.5%. This change was primarily due to increased investment in research and development spending, as well as the impact of $302 million of IPR&D expenses in 2005.
Medical Devices and Diagnostics Segment: In 2006, the operating profit in the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment increased 16.9%, and as a percent to sales increased 2.8%. The primary driver of
the improved operating profit was the Guidant acquisition agreement termination fee, less associated expenses, of $622 million recorded during 2006. This was partially offset by increases in IPR&D charges. In
addition, advertising and promotional expense leveraging were offset in part by increases in research and development spending.
In 2005, the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment operating profit increased 33.5%, and as a percent to sales increased 4.2% from 2004 to 27.4%. This increase was driven by improved gross margins
due to cost reduction programs and product mix, primarily related to the CYPHER® Sirolimus-eluting Stent. This was partially offset by an increased investment in research and development spending.
Interest (Income) Expense: Interest income in 2006 increased by $342 million due primarily to higher rates of interest, as well as a higher average cash balance despite the $5.0 billion common stock
repurchase program and an increase in acquisition activity. The cash balance, including current marketable securities was $4.1 billion at the end of 2006 and averaged $15.7 billion, as compared to the $14.3 billion
average cash balance in 2005.
Interest expense in 2006 increased slightly as compared to 2005 due to a higher average debt balance, from $2.6 billion in 2005 to $3.1 billion in 2006. This was partially offset by a decrease in interest rates.
Interest income in 2005 increased by $292 million due primarily to higher rates of interest, as well as a higher average cash balance. The cash balance, including current marketable securities, was
$16.1 billion at the end of 2005 and averaged $14.3 billion, as compared to the $11.3 billion average cash balance in 2004.
Interest expense in 2005 decreased as compared to 2004 due in part to a decrease in the average debt balance, from $3.5 billion in 2004 to $2.6 billion in 2005.
Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 24.2% in 2006, 23.3% in 2005 and 33.7% in 2004. The 2006 tax rate benefited from a reversal of tax allowances of $134 million
associated with the Tibotec business, partially offset by the Guidant acquisition agreement termination fee recorded at a 40.8% rate. The 2005 effective tax rate included a benefit of $225 million, due to the
reversal of a tax liability previously recorded during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2004, related to a technical correction to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows
In 2006, cash flow from operations was $14.2 billion, an increase of $2.4 billion over 2005. The increase in cash generated from operations was a result of a net income increase of $1.2 billion, net of the non-
cash impact of IPR&D charges. The major changes in assets and liabilities were a $2.7 billion increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by a $0.9 billion increase in deferred taxes and a
$0.8 billion increase in other current and non-current assets.
Net cash used by investing activities increased by $20.0 billion. This was primarily due to a $17.0 billion increase in acquisition activity most of which occurred late in the fiscal fourth quarter. For a more
detailed discussion on mergers and acquisitions, see Note 17. There was also a $3.6 billion net decrease in sales of investments. Capital expenditures were $2.7 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.2 billion in 2006, 2005,
and 2004, respectively.Net cash used by financing activities increased by $1.7 billion. This was due to the $5.0 billion used for the common stock repurchase program which was publicly announced on March 8, 2006 and completed
early in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006. This was partially offset by $3.3 billion of net proceeds from short term debt.
Cash and current marketable securities were $4.1 billion at the end of 2006 as compared with $16.1 billion at the end of 2005, primarily due to the acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer
Inc. on December 20, 2006.
Cash generated from operations amounted to $11.8 billion in 2005, which was $0.7 billion more than the cash generated from operations in 2004 of $11.1 billion. The major factors contributing to the increase
were a net income increase of $2.2 billion, net of the non-cash impact of IPR&D charges. A $1.0 billion decrease in other current and non-current assets also contributed to this increase. This was partially offset by
a $1.5 billion decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Additionally, cash payments of approximately $0.5 billion were made for previously accrued taxes on the repatriation of undistributed
international earnings in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. There was also an increase of approximately $0.2 billion in pension funding in 2005 as compared to 2004.

Financing and Market Risk
The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value
of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency products costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10%
appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 31, 2006 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $262 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S.
Dollar from the December 31, 2006 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $320 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be
offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and, therefore, would have no impact on future earnings and cash flows.
The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the
spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by
approximately $127 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future cash
flows.
The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an “A” (or
equivalent) credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss
is remote.
Total unused credit available to the Company approximates $10.8 billion, including $9 billion of credit commitments, of which $3.75 billion expire September 27, 2007, $4 billion expire October 30, 2007 and
$1.25 billion expire September 28, 2011. Also included are $0.75 billion of uncommitted lines with various banks worldwide that expire during 2007.
Total borrowings at the end of 2006 and 2005 were $6.6 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings between 2005 and 2006 was a result of financing the acquisition of the Consumer
Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. in December 2006. In 2006, net debt (cash and current marketable securities net of debt) was $2.5 billion compared to net cash of $13.5 billion in 2005. Total debt represented
14.4% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2006 and 6.5% of total capital in 2005. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2006 was $13.59 compared with $13.01 at year-end 2005, an
increase of 4.5%.
For the period ended December 31, 2006, there were no material cash commitments. Johnson & Johnson continues to be one of a few industrial companies with a Triple A credit rating. A summary of
borrowings can be found in Note 6.
Long-Term Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The Company has long-term contractual obligations, primarily lease, debt obligations and unfunded retirement plans, with no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use
cash from operations. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 31, 2006 (see Notes 4, 6 and 13 for further details):

Share Repurchase and Dividends
On March 8, 2006, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the Company to buy back up to $5.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. This
program was completed early in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006 with 81.3 million shares repurchased. In addition the Company has an annual program to repurchase shares for use in employee stock and incentive
plans.
The Company increased its dividend in 2006 for the 44th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $1.455 per share in 2006, compared with dividends of $1.275 per share in 2005 and $1.095 per share in
2004. The dividends were distributed as follows:
2006 2005 2004
First quarter $0.330 0.285 0.240
Second quarter 0.375 0.330 0.285
Third quarter 0.375 0.330 0.285
Fourth quarter 0.375 0.330 0.285
Total $1.455 1.275 1.095
On January 2, 2007, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.375 per share, payable on March 13, 2007, to shareholders of record as of February 27, 2007. The Company expects to
continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets,
liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in
achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self insurance contingencies, valuation of
long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock options.
Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives,
trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, the largest
being the Medicaid rebate provision, are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market
conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.
Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters
are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return
trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based
sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are derived by estimating sales volumes
for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold.
Reasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently
discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a financial statement impact.
Below are tables which show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the years ended December 31,
2006 and January 1, 2006.

The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products. For all years presented, service revenues were less than 2% of total revenues and are included in sales to customers.
Income Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and U.S. tax reporting,
recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on current tax regulations and rates. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax
assets and liabilities in the future. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not result in a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In 2005, the Company repatriated $10.8 billion of undistributed international earnings in accordance with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA), and recorded a tax charge of $789 million during
the fiscal fourth quarter of 2004. During the fiscal second quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $225 million, due to the reversal of the tax liability previously recorded during the fiscal fourth
quarter of 2004, associated with a technical correction made to the AJCA in May 2005. At December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, the cumulative amount of undistributed international earnings wereapproximately $17.9 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively. The Company intends to continue to reinvest its undistributed international earnings to expand its international operations; therefore, no U.S. tax
expense has been recorded to cover the undistributed portion not intended for repatriation.
Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies including legal proceedings and product liability cases as these arise in the normal course of business. The
accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses, opinions of legal counsel and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records insurance
receivable amounts from third party insurers when recovery is probable. As appropriate, reserves against these receivables are recorded for estimated amounts that may not be collected from third party insurers.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property,
plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.
Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, that cover most employees
worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, expected salary increases and health care cost trend rates. See Note 13 for further detail on these rates and the
effect a rate change would have on the Company’s results of operations. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158, Employer’s Accounting for Defined Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of
FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). This statement requires the recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the statement of financial position, and that changes in the funded status in the year in
which the changes occur be recognized through other comprehensive income (OCI), net of tax.
Stock Options: During the fiscal first quarter of 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. The Company has applied the modified retrospective transition method to implement
SFAS No. 123(R). Previously reported financial statements have been restated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). See Note 10 for further information regarding stock options.
New Accounting Standards
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. This statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an
entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services. It focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions (such as
employee stock options and restricted stock units). The statement requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments (such as employee stock
options and restricted stock units) at fair value on the grant date. That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award (the requisite
service period). The Company adopted this statement in the fiscal first quarter of 2006, applying the modified retrospective transition method. Previously reported financial statements have been restated to reflect
the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R).
47Table of Contents
The Company implemented SFAS 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43 in the fiscal first quarter of 2006. The adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the Company’s results
of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This interpretation prescribes a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on
derecognition, classification and other matters. FIN 48 is effective for the fiscal year 2007 and the Company will adopt it accordingly. The Company is assessing the impact of the adoption of FIN 48 and currently
does not believe that the adoption will have a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The statement is effective in the fiscal first quarter of 2008 and the Company will adopt the statement at that time.
The Company believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employer’s Accounting for Defined Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). This statement requires the recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the statement of financial position. It also requires the recognition as a component of other
comprehensive income (OCI), net of tax, of the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to
statements 87 or 106. The statement also has new provisions regarding the measurement date as well as certain disclosure requirements. The statement was effective at fiscal year end 2006 and the Company
adopted the statement at that time.
In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 108, which expresses the Staff’s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements. The bulletin was effective
at fiscal year end 2006. The implementation of this bulletin had no impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
The following accounting pronouncements became effective in 2005 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position:
• FIN 47: Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.
• SFAS 153: Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets, an amendment of APB 29.
The following accounting pronouncements became effective in 2004 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position:
• EITF Issue 02-14: Whether an Investor should apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments other than Common Stock.
• EITF Issue 04-1: Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination.
Economic and Market Factors
Johnson & Johnson is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care.
In response to these concerns, Johnson & Johnson has a long standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 1996 — 2006, in the United States, the weighted average compound annual growth rate
of Johnson & Johnson net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).
Inflation rates, even though moderate in many parts of the world during 2006, continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. In the face of increasing
costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases. The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that
may result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement.The Company also operates in an environment which has become increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Generic drug firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking to market
generic forms of most of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products, prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent
claims challenged in Abbreviated New Drug Application filings, the generic firms will then introduce generic versions of the product at issue, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue
losses for that product. For further information see the discussion on “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 18.
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in numerous product liability cases in the United States, many of which concern adverse reactions to drugs and medical devices. The damages claimed are substantial, and while the
Company is confident of the adequacy of the warnings and instructions for use which accompany such products, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. However, the Company believes that
if any liability results from such cases, it will be substantially covered by existing amounts accrued in the Company’s balance sheet under its self-insurance program and by third party product liability insurance.
The Company is also involved in a number of patent, trademark and other lawsuits incidental to its business. The ultimate legal and financial liability of the Company in respect to all claims, lawsuits and
proceedings referred to above cannot be estimated with any certainty. However, in the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the
ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities already accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, although the
resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.
See Note 18 for further information regarding legal proceedings.

Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results
This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to
uncertainty. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words like “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other
things, discussions of future operations, financial performance, the Company’s strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approval, market position and expenditures.
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events. The Company cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be accurate, although the Company believes that it has
been reasonable in its expectations and assumptions. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or that unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially
from the Company’s expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking
statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.
Risks and uncertainties include general industry conditions and competition; economic conditions, such as interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; technological advances, new products and
patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining regulatory approvals; challenges to patents; U.S. and foreign health care reforms and governmental laws and
regulations; trends toward health care cost containment; increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government agencies; product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls or regulatory action.
The Company’s report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes, in Exhibit 99, a discussion of additional factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations. The Company
notes these factors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and subsidiaries (the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.
Description of the Company and Business Segments
The Company has approximately 122,200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts
business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. The Consumer segment manufactures and markets a broad range of products used in
the baby and kids care, skin care, oral care, wound care and women’s health care fields, as well as nutritional and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. These products are marketed principally to the general
public and sold both to wholesalers and directly to independent and chain retail outlets throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following therapeutic areas: anti-fungal, anti-
infective, cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology, gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management, psychotropic (central nervous system), urology and virology areas. These
products are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for prescription use by the general public. The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of products
used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and clinics. These products include Cordis’ circulatory disease management products; DePuy’s
orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal care products; Ethicon’s wound care and women’s health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery’s minimally invasive surgical products; LifeScan’s blood glucose monitoring
and insulin delivery products; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics’ professional diagnostic products and Vision Care’s disposable contact lenses.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. This statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for
goods and services. It focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions (such as employee stock options and restricted stock units).
The statement requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments (such as employee stock options and restricted stock units) at fair value on the
grant date. That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award (the requisite service period). The Company adopted this statement in
the fiscal first quarter of 2006, applying the modified retrospective transition method. Previously reported financial statements have been restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). (See Note 10.)
The Company implemented SFAS 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43 in the fiscal first quarter of 2006. The adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the Company’s results
of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48 [FIN 48], Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This interpretation prescribes a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on
derecognition, classification and other matters. FIN 48 is effective for the fiscal year 2007 and the Company will adopt accordingly. The Company is assessing the impact of the adoption of FIN 48 and currently
does not believe that the adoption will have a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The statement is effective in the fiscal first quarter of 2008 and the Company will adopt the statement at that time.
The Company believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employer’s Accounting for Defined Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). This statement requires the recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the statement of financial position. It also requires the recognition as a component of other
comprehensive income (OCI), net of tax, of the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to
statements 87 or 106. The statement also has new provisions regarding the measurement date as well as certain disclosure requirements. The statement was effective at fiscal year end 2006 and the Company
adopted the statement at that time. (See Note 13.)
In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 108, which expresses the Staff’s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements. The bulletin was effective
at fiscal year end 2006. The implementation of this bulletin had no impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
The following accounting pronouncements became effective in 2005 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position:
• FIN 47: Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143.
• SFAS 153: Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets, an amendment of APB 29.
54Table of Contents
The following accounting pronouncements became effective in 2004 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position:
• EITF Issue 02-14: Whether an Investor should apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments other than Common Stock.
• EITF Issue 04-1: Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers securities with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.
Investments
Short-term marketable securities are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Long-term debt securities that the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity are carried at amortized cost, which also approximates fair
value. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company
periodically reviews its investments in equity securities for impairment and adjusts these investments to their fair value when a decline in market value is deemed to be other than temporary.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets:
Building and building equipment 20-40 years
Land and leasehold improvements 10-20 years
Machinery and equipment 2-13 years
The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use.
Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3 to 5 years.
The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When necessary, charges for impairments of long-lived assets are recorded for the amount by which the present
value of future cash flows is less than the carrying value of these assets.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the goods are shipped or delivered and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions,
product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, the largest
being the Medicaid rebate provision, are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market
conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters
are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field,
or in specific areas, product recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based
sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes
for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products and includes it in sales to customers.
Shipping and Handling
Shipping and handling costs incurred were $693 million, $736 million and $679 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of
revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined by the first-in, first-out method.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2002 in accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company discontinued the amortization relating to all existing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, which are
non-amortizable. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed the annual impairment test for 2006 in the fiscal fourth
quarter and no impairment was determined. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a triggering event occurs.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 7 for further details on
Intangible Assets.
Financial Instruments
The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. SFAS No. 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge
transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.
55Table of Contents
The Company uses forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany product and third party
purchases of raw materials denominated in foreign currency. The Company also uses currency swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both of these types of derivatives are designated as
cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedges
and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date into the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is
designated as a cash flow hedge and is highly effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same
account as the hedged transaction. The fair value of a derivative instrument (i.e. forward foreign exchange contract, currency swap) is the aggregation, by currency, of all future cash flows discounted to its present
value at prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate.
On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to
be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period earnings, and was insignificant in 2006, 2005 and 2004.
The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The
objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates;
(3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions.
Product Liability
Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing
information. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. As a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third party
product liability insurance. Based on the availability of prior coverage, receivables for insurance recoveries related to product liability claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a
recovery will be realized.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up
to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for
such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.
Advertising
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in the selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which are comprised of television,
radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $1.9 billion in 2006, $2.1 billion in 2005 and $1.9 billion in 2004.
Income Taxes
The Company intends to continue to reinvest its undistributed international earnings to expand its international operations; therefore, no U.S. tax expense has been recorded to cover the undistributed portion
not intended for repatriation. At December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, the cumulative amount of undistributed international earnings were approximately $17.9 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively.Deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates, applicable to future years, to differences between the financial reporting and the
tax basis of existing assets and liabilities.
Net Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share
reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible
asset and liability valuations. For instance, in determining annual pension and post-employment benefit costs, the Company estimates the rate of return on plan assets, and the cost of future health care benefits.
Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.
Annual Closing Date
The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years, the fiscal
year consists of 53 weeks, as was the case in 2004.

The Company capitalizes interest expense as part of the cost of construction of facilities and equipment. Interest expense capitalized in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $118 million, $111 million and $136 million,
respectively.
Depreciation expense, including the amortization of capitalized interest in 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.
Upon retirement or other disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related amount of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation
accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds is recorded in earnings.
4. Rental Expense and Lease Commitments
Rentals of space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and office and data processing equipment under operating leases were approximately $285 million in 2006, $248 million in 2005 and $254 million in
2004.

margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.
The Company filed a shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that became effective November 13, 2006 which enables the Company to issue up to $10 billion in debt
securities and warrants to purchase debt securities. There was no debt issued during 2006 and the full amount remained available as of December 31, 2006.
On July 28, 2000, ALZA completed a private offering of the 3% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Debentures, which were issued at a price of $551.26 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. At
December 31, 2006 the outstanding 3% Debentures had a total principal amount at maturity of $272.5 million with a yield to maturity of 3% per annum, computed on a semiannual bond equivalent basis. There are
no periodic interest payments. Under the terms of the 3% debentures, holders are entitled to convert their debentures into approximately 15.0 million shares of Johnson & Johnson stock at a price of $40.102 per
share. Approximately 11.2 million shares have been issued as of December 31, 2006, due to voluntary conversions by note holders. At the option of the holder, the 3% Debentures may be repurchased by the
Company on July 28, 2008 or 2013, at a purchase price equal to the issue price plus accreted original issue discount to such purchase date. The Company, at its option, may elect to deliver either Johnson &
Johnson common stock or cash, or a combination of stock and cash, in the event of repurchase of the 3% Debentures. The Company, at its option, may also redeem any or all of the 3% Debentures after July 28,

The Company had subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico under various tax incentive grants. Also, the U.S. possessions tax credit, which expired in 2006, applies to certain operations in Puerto Rico. In
addition, the Company had subsidiaries manufacturing in Ireland under an incentive tax rate. The increase in the 2006 tax rate was mainly due to the reversal of a tax liability of $225 million reported in the 2005
tax provision which resulted from a technical correction to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. This was partially offset by a benefit reported in 2006 for the reversal of tax allowances of $134 million
associated with the Tibotec business.

9. International Currency Translation
For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in
highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are
not in the local currency.
In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. This equity account includes the results of translating all
balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies that are reflected in operating results.
An analysis of the changes during 2006, 2005 and 2004 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 12.
Net currency transaction and translation gains and losses included in other (income) expense were losses of $18 million, $32 million, and $38 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
10. Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements
Stock Options
At December 31, 2006 the Company had 17 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company’s 1995 and 2000 Stock Option Plans, the 2005 Long-Term Incentive
Plan, the 2000 Stock Compensation Plan, the 1997 Non-Employee Director’s Plan and the Centocor, Innovasive Devices, ALZA, Inverness and Scios Stock Option Plans. During 2006, no options or restricted
stock were granted under any of these plans except the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The compensation cost recorded under SFAS No. 123(R) that has been charged against income for these plans was $659 million for 2006, $540 million for 2005, and $507 million for 2004. The total income
tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share based compensation costs was $228 million for 2006, $189 million for 2005, and $178 million for 2004. Share based compensation costs capitalized as part
of inventory were insignificant in all periods.
Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from six months to five years. All options are granted at current market price on the date of grant. Under the 2005
Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 260 million shares of common stock. Shares available for future grants under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 224.7 million at the end of 2006.
The Company settles employee stock option exercises with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee stock option exercises.
59Table of Contents
The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. Starting in 2006, expected
volatility represents a blended rate of 4 year daily historical average volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. Prior
to 2006, expected volatility was based on 5-year weekly historical volatility rate. Historical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
effect at the time of grant.
The average fair value of options granted was $12.22 in 2006, $15.48 in 2005, and $13.11 in 2004. The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of:
2006 2005 2004
Risk-free rate 4.60% 3.72% 3.15%
Expected volatility 19.6% 25.0% 27.0%
Expected life 6.0 yrs 5.0 yrs 5.0 yrs

Total other comprehensive income for 2006 includes reclassification adjustment gains of $13 million realized from the sale of equity securities and the associated tax expense of $4 million. Total other
comprehensive income for 2005 includes reclassification adjustment gains of $23 million realized from the sale of equity securities and the associated tax expense of $8 million. Total other comprehensive income
for 2004 includes reclassification adjustment gains of $16 million realized from the sale of equity securities and the associated tax expense of $6 million.
The tax effect on the unrealized gains/(losses) on the equity securities balance is an expense of $33 million, $38 million and $47 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The tax effect related to
employee benefit plans was $891 million in 2006 and $160 million in 2005. The tax effect on the gains/(losses) on derivatives and hedges are losses of $4 million and $11 million in 2006 and 2005 and a benefit of
$81 million in 2004. See Note 15 for additional information relating to derivatives and hedging.
The currency translation adjustments are not currently adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in international subsidiaries.13. Pensions and Other Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also
provides postretirement benefits, primarily health care insurance, to all U.S. retired employees and their dependents.
Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs for which the direct cost to the Company is not significant.
Retirement plan benefits are primarily based on the employee’s compensation during the last three to five years before retirement and the number of years of service. International subsidiaries have plans
under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts or reserves are provided.
The Company does not fund retiree health care benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the future.
The Company uses the date of its consolidated financial statements (December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively) as the measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit
plans.
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) which requires an employer to fully recognize the over-funded or under-funded status of its pension and other postretirement benefit plans as an asset or liability in its
financial statements. In addition, the Company is required to recognize as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during
the period but are not immediately recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. The incremental effect of applying SFAS No. 158 is a $1.7 billion reduction in shareholder’s equity, net of deferred taxes.

Rate of increase in compensation levels 3.75 3.75 3.75 4.50 4.25 4.25The Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of
plan liabilities.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions is determined using a building block approach, considering historical averages and real returns of each asset class. In certain countries, where
historical returns are not meaningful, consideration is given to local market expectations of long-term returns.

Strategic asset allocations are determined by country, based on the nature of the liabilities and considering the demographic composition of the plan participants (average age, years of service and active versus
retiree status). The Company’s plans are considered non-mature plans and the long-term strategic asset allocations are consistent with these types of plans. Emphasis is placed on diversifying equities on a broad
basis combined with currency matching of the fixed income assets.

The Company was not required to fund its U.S. retirement plans in 2006 and is not required, nor does it anticipate funding, in 2007 to meet minimum statutory funding requirements. International plans are
funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans. In certain countries other than the United
States, the funding of pension plans is not a common practice as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans which are not funded.
The following table displays the projected future minimum contributions to the Company’s U.S. and international unfunded retirement plans. These amounts do not include any discretionary contributions that
the Company may elect to make in the future.

15. Financial Instruments
The Company follows the provisions of SFAS 133 requiring that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
As of December 31, 2006, the balance of deferred net gains on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $9 million after-tax. The Company expects that substantially all of this
amount will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction
exposure is 18 months. The amount ultimately realized in earnings will differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the
derivative. Derivative gains/(losses), initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income, are reclassified to earnings in the period when the forecasted transaction affects earnings.
For the years ended December 31, 2006, January 1, 2006, and January 2, 2005, the net impact of hedge ineffectiveness, transactions not qualifying for hedge accounting and discontinuance of hedges, to the
Company’s financial statements was insignificant.
Refer to Note 12 for disclosures of movements in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company invests its excess cash in both deposits with major banks throughout the world and other high quality money market instruments. The Company has a policy of making investments only with
commercial institutions that have at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. On average these investments mature within six months, and the Company has not incurred any related losses.
16. Savings PlanThe Company has voluntary 401(k) savings plans designed to enhance the existing retirement programs covering eligible employees. The Company matches a percentage of each employee’s contributions
consistent with the provisions of the plan for which he/she is eligible.
In the U.S. salaried plan, through 2004, one-third of the Company match was paid in Company stock under an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) unless the employee chose to redirect his or her
investment. In 1990, to establish the ESOP, the Company loaned $100 million to the ESOP Trust to purchase shares of the Company stock on the open market. In exchange, the Company received a note, the
balance of which was recorded as a reduction of shareholders’ equity. The remaining shares held by the ESOP trust were allocated to participant accounts by the end of February 2005. From March 2005, and going
forward, the Company match is made in cash and follows the individual employee’s investment elections.
Total Company contributions to the plans were $158 million in 2006, $148 million in 2005 and $143 million in 2004.

17. Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures
Certain businesses were acquired for $18.0 billion in cash and $1.3 billion of liabilities assumed during 2006. These acquisitions were accounted for by the purchase method and, accordingly, results of
operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisitions except as noted below.
On December 20, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. for a purchase price of $16.6 billion in cash. The operating results of the Consumer
Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. will be reported in the Company’s financial statements beginning in 2007, as 2006 results subsequent to the acquisition date were not significant.
In order to obtain regulatory approval of the transaction, the Company agreed to divest certain overlapping businesses. The Company completed the divestiture of the ZANTAC® product on December 20,
2006 and the divestitures of KAOPECTATE®, UNISOM®, CORTIZONE®, BALMEX® and ACT® products on January 2, 2007.
The following table provides pro forma results of operations for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2006 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, as if the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. had
been acquired as of the beginning of each period presented. The pro forma results include the effect of divestitures and certain purchase accounting adjustments such as the estimated changes in depreciation and
amortization expense on the acquired tangible and intangible assets. However, pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of the planned integration of the Consumer Healthcare
business of Pfizer Inc. Accordingly, such amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results if the acquisition had occurred on the dates indicated or which may occur in the future.

The Company is in the process of finalizing the allocation of the purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price included in the current
period balance sheet is based on the best estimates of management. The completion of the purchase price allocation may result in adjustments to the carrying value of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer
Inc.’s recorded assets and liabilities, revisions of the useful lives of intangible assets and the determination of any residual amount that will be allocated to goodwill. The related depreciation and amortization from
the acquired assets is also subject to revision based on the final allocation.
The following table presents the preliminary allocation of the purchase price related to the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. as of the date of acquisition:

Total liabilities assumed $ 1,986
Net assets acquired $16,277
The acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. resulted in $6.6 billion in goodwill, which is allocated to the Consumer segment.
The preliminary purchase price allocation to the identifiable intangible assets included in the current period balance sheet is as follows:
(Dollars in
Millions)
Intangible assets with determinable lives:
Brands $ 302
Patents and technology 321
Customer relationships 3,067
Total amortizable intangibles 3,690
Brands with indefinite lives 5,205
Total intangible assets $8,895
The weighted average life of the $3,690 million of total amortizable intangibles is approximately 31 years.
The majority of the intangible asset valuation relates to brands. The assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life was based on a number of factors, including the
competitive environment, market share, brand history, product life cycles, operating plan and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. The indefinite-life brands that account
for over 90% of the total value of all indefinite-life brands include LISTERINE®, NICORETTE®, NEOSPORIN®, SUDAFED®, BENADRYL®, VISINE® and BENYLIN®. The determinable-life brands include
PURELL®, ACTIFED®, EFFERDENT® and other regional or country specific brands. The determinable-life brands have asset lives ranging from 5 to 40 years. The patents and technology intangibles are
concentrated in the upper respiratory, oral care, medicated skin care, tobacco dependence and hair growth businesses and have asset lives ranging from 5 to 20 years. The estimated customer relationship intangible
asset useful lives, ranging from 30 to 40 years, reflect the very low historical and projected customer attrition rates among the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc.’s major retailer and distributor
customers.
The IPR&D charge related to the acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. was $320 million on a pre-tax basis and $217 million on an after-tax basis and is primarily associated with
rights obtained to the pending switch of ZYRTEC® from U.S. prescription to over the counter status.

The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. A probability of success factor of 95% was used to reflect inherent regulatory risk and the
discount rate applied was 11%.
The Company is in the process of completing the analysis of integration plans, pursuant to which the Company will incur costs primarily related to the elimination of certain duplicate selling, general and
administrative functions between the two companies in areas such as global business services, corporate staff and go-to-market support, as well as excess manufacturing capacity.
In addition to the acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc., 2006 acquisitions included: Animas Corporation, a leading maker of insulin infusion pumps and related products; Hand
Innovations LLC, a privately held manufacturer of fracture fixation products for the upper extremities; Future Medical Systems S.A., a privately held company that primarily develops, manufactures and markets
arthroscopic fluid management systems; Vascular Control Systems, Inc., a privately held company focused on developing medical devices to treat fibroids and to control bleeding in obstetric and gynecologic
applications; Groupe Vendôme S.A., a privately held French marketer of adult and baby skin care products; ColBar Lifescience Ltd., a privately held company specializing in reconstructive medicine and tissue
engineering and Ensure Medical, Inc., a privately held company that develops devices for post-catheterization closure of the femoral artery.
Excluding the acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc., the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $1,209 million and has been
assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Approximately $239 million has been identified as the value of IPR&D primarily associated with the acquisitions of Hand
Innovations LLC, Future Medical Systems S.A., Vascular Control Systems, Inc., ColBar Lifescience Ltd. and Ensure Medical, Inc.
The IPR&D charge related to the acquisition of Hand Innovations LLC was $22 million and is associated with fracture repair technologies. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections
discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. A probability of success factor ranging from 38-95% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk and the discount rate applied was 17%.
The IPR&D charge related to the acquisition of Future Medical Systems S.A. was $15 million and is associated with the NEXTRA and DUO PUMP product technologies. The value of the IPR&D was
calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. A probability of success factor of 90% for both technologies was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk and the
discount rate applied was 22%.
The IPR&D charge related to the acquisition of Vascular Control Systems, Inc. was $87 million and is associated with the FLOSTAT system technology. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash
flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. A probability of success factor of 75% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk and the discount rate applied was 21%.
The IPR&D charge related to the acquisition of ColBar Lifescience Ltd. was $49 million and is associated with the EVOLENCE family of products, which are biodegradable dermal fillers. The value of the
IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. A probability of success factor ranging from 70-80% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk and
the discount rate applied was 21%.
The IPR&D charge related to the acquisition of Ensure Medical, Inc. was $66 million and is associated with the femoral artery closure device. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow
projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. A probability of success factor of 75% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk and the discount rate applied was 22%.
Certain businesses were acquired for $987 million in cash and $141 million of liabilities assumed during 2005. These acquisitions were accounted for by the purchase method and, accordingly, results of
operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisitions.
The 2005 acquisitions included: TransForm Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a company specializing in the discovery of superior formulations and novel crystalline forms of drug molecules; Closure Medical
Corporation, a company with expertise and intellectual property in the biosurgicals market; Peninsula Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing antibiotics
to treat life-threatening infections; and rights to all consumer and professionally dispensed REMBRANDT® Brand of oral care products, such as whitening toothpastes, strips, systems and mouth rinses.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $720 million and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.
Approximately $362 million has been identified as the value of IPR&D primarily associated with the acquisitions of TransForm Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Closure Medical Corporation and Peninsula Pharmaceuticals,
Inc.The IPR&D charge related to the acquisition of TransForm Pharmaceuticals Inc. was $50 million and is associated with research related to the discovery and application of superior formulations. The value of
the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate applied was 10%.
The IPR&D charge related to the acquisition of Closure Medical Corporation was $51 million and is associated with the OMNEXTM Surgical Sealant in vascular indications outside Europe and in other
potential indications worldwide. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. A probability of success factor of 90% for vascular indications
and 60% for all other indications was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied to both vascular and other indications was 15%.
The IPR&D charge related to the acquisition of Peninsula Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was $252 million and is associated with the development of doripenem, which is in Phase III clinical trials. The value of the
IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. A probability of success factor of 80% was used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk and the discount
rate applied was 14%.
The remaining $9 million in IPR&D was associated with the acquisition of international commercial rights to certain patents and know-how in the field of sedation and analgesia from Scott Lab, Inc. The
value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow
68Table of Contents
projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate was 17%.
Certain businesses were acquired for $455 million in cash and $15 million of liabilities assumed during 2004. These acquisitions were accounted for by the purchase method and, accordingly, results of
operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
In addition, per the terms of the 2003 acquisition agreement with the Link Spine Group, Inc., $125 million in cash was paid to the owners of the Link Spine Group, Inc. in 2004 based on the date the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the CHARITÉTM Artificial Disc. Thus, the 2004 total cash expenditures related to acquisitions were $580 million.
The 2004 acquisitions included: Merck’s 50% interest in the Johnson & Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co. European non-prescription pharmaceutical joint venture including all of the
infrastructure and brand assets managed by the European joint venture; Egea Biosciences, Inc. through the exercise of the option to acquire the remaining outstanding stock not owned by Johnson & Johnson,
which has developed a proprietary technology platform called GENE WRITER, that allows for the rapid and highly accurate synthesis of DNA sequences, gene assembly, and construction of large synthetic gene
libraries; Artemis Medical, Inc., a privately held company with ultrasound and x-ray visible biopsy site breast markers as well as hybrid markers; U.S. commercial rights to certain patents and know-how in the
field of sedation and analgesia from Scott Lab, Inc.; Biapharm SAS, a privately held French producer and marketer of skin care products centered around the leading brand BIAFINE®; the assets of Micomed, a
privately owned manufacturer of spinal implants primarily focused on supplying the German market; and the acquisition of the AMBI® skin care brand for women of color.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $425 million and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.
The $125 million related to the U.S. FDA approval of the CHARITÉTM Artificial Disc was recorded as additional goodwill associated with the 2003 Link Spine Group, Inc. acquisition. Thus, total additions to
intangibles and goodwill in 2004 were $550 million. Approximately $18 million has been identified as the value of IPR&D associated with the Scott Lab acquisition. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using
cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate was 25%.
Supplemental pro forma information for 2005 and 2004 per SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, is not provided, as the impact of the
aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
Divestitures in 2006, 2005 and 2004 did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
18. Legal Proceedings
Product Liability
The Company is involved in numerous product liability cases in the United States, many of which concern adverse reactions to drugs and medical devices. The damages claimed are substantial, and while the
Company is confident of the adequacy of the warnings and instructions for use that accompany such products, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. However, the Company believes that if
any liability results from such cases, it will be substantially covered by existing amounts accrued in the Company’s balance sheet and, where available, by third-party product liability insurance.
Multiple products of Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries are subject to numerous product liability claims and lawsuits, including ORTHO EVRA®, RISPERDAL®, DURAGESIC® and the CHARITÉTM
Artificial Disc. As of December 31, 2006, there were approximately 1,500 claimants who have filed lawsuits or made claims regarding injuries allegedly due to ORTHO EVRA®, 700 claimants with respect to
RISPERDAL®, 100 with respect to DURAGESIC® and 100 with respect to CHARITÉTM. These claimants seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. Numerous claims and lawsuits
in the United States relating to the drug PROPULSID®, withdrawn from general sale by the Company’s Janssen Pharmaceutica Inc. subsidiary in 2000, have been resolved or are currently enrolled in settlement
programs with an aggregate cap below $100 million in payments by the Company. Litigation concerning PROPULSID® is pending in Canada, where a class action of persons alleging adverse reactions to the drug
was recently certified. The Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries responsible for marketing the above products are vigorously defending against these claims except where settlement is deemed appropriate.
Affirmative Stent Patent LitigationIn patent infringement actions tried in Delaware Federal District Court in late 2000, Cordis Corporation (Cordis), a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, obtained verdicts of infringement and patent validity, and
damage awards against Boston Scientific Corporation (Boston Scientific) and Medtronic AVE, Inc. (Medtronic) based on a number of Cordis vascular stent patents. In December 2000, the jury in the damage
action against Boston Scientific returned a verdict of $324 million and the jury in the Medtronic action returned a verdict of $271 million. Multiple post-trial proceedings and appeals have ensued with respect to
these verdicts, with the ultimate outcome still subject to uncertainty.
Cordis also has an arbitration claim against Medtronic accusing Medtronic of infringement by sale of stent products introduced by Medtronic subsequent to its products subject to the earlier action referenced
above. Those subsequent products were found to have been licensed to Medtronic pursuant to a 1997 license by an arbitration panel in March 2005. Further arbitration proceedings will determine whether royalties
are owed for those products.
In January 2003, Cordis filed a patent infringement action against Boston Scientific in Delaware Federal District Court accusing its Express2TM, Taxus® and Liberte® stents of infringing the Palmaz patent
that expired in November 2005. The Liberte® stent was also accused of infringing Cordis’ Gray patent that expires in 2016. In June 2005, a jury found that the Express2TM, Taxus® and Liberte® stents infringed
the Palmaz patent and that the Liberte® stent also infringed the Gray patent. Motions filed by Boston Scientific seeking to vacate the verdict or obtain a new trial were denied in June 2006. Cordis expects Boston
Scientific will appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Patent Litigation Against Various Johnson & Johnson Subsidiaries
The products of various Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries are the subject of various patent lawsuits, the outcomes of which
69Table of Contents
could potentially adversely affect the ability of those subsidiaries to sell those products, or require the payment of past damages and future royalties. With respect to all of these matters, the Johnson & Johnson
subsidiary involved is vigorously defending against the claims of infringement and disputing, where appropriate, the validity and enforceability of the patent claims asserted against it.
In July 2005, a jury in Federal District Court in Delaware found that the Cordis CYPHER® stent infringed Boston Scientific’s Ding ’536 patent and that the Cordis CYPHER® and BX VELOCITY® stents
also infringed Boston Scientific’s Jang ’021 patent. The jury also found both of those patents valid. Boston Scientific seeks substantial damages and an injunction in that action. In June 2006, the District Court
denied motions by Cordis to overturn the jury verdicts or grant a new trial. Cordis has moved for re-consideration of those decisions. If reconsideration is denied, Cordis will appeal to the Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit. The District Court indicated it will consider damages, willfulness and injunctive relief after the appeals have been decided.
Trial of Boston Scientific’s case asserting infringement by the CYPHER® stent of Boston Scientific’s Grainger patent, which had been scheduled for March 2006, has been adjourned pending a decision on
Cordis’ motion for summary judgment. In that case as well, Boston Scientific seeks an injunction and substantial damages.
Boston Scientific has brought actions in Belgium and the Netherlands under its Kastenhofer patent to enjoin the manufacture and sale of allegedly infringing catheters in those countries, and to recover
damages. The Belgian case is pending and no hearing date has been set. A decision by the lower court in the Netherlands in Boston Scientific’s favor is on appeal.
In Germany, Boston Scientific has several actions based on its Ding patents pending against the Cordis CYPHER® stent. Cordis was successful in these actions at the trial level, but Boston Scientific has
appealed.

Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)
The following chart indicates lawsuits pending against generic firms that filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of the Company
prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of these patents. In the event the subsidiary of
the Company involved is not successful in these actions, or the statutory 30-month stay expires before a ruling from the district court is obtained, the firms involved will have the ability, upon FDA approval, to
introduce generic versions of the product at issue resulting in very substantial market share and revenue losses for the product of the Company’s subsidiary.
As noted in the following chart, 30-month stays expired during 2006 and will expire in 2007 or 2008 with respect to ANDA challenges regarding various products:Patent/NDA Generic Trial Date 30-Month

In the action against Mylan and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories regarding RISPERDAL® (risperidone) tablets and M-Tabs, the District Court in New Jersey ruled, on October 13, 2006, that the RISPERDAL®
patent was valid, enforceable, and infringed by the generic products at issue, and entered an injunction prohibiting Mylan and Dr. Reddy’s from marketing their generic risperidone products until a date no earlier
than patent expiration in December 2007. Mylan has appealed that ruling.
In the action against Mylan with respect to the patent on TOPAMAX®, the District Court in New Jersey, on October 24, 2006, granted the Company’s subsidiary Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc.’s (Ortho-
McNeil) motion for a preliminary injunction barring launch by Mylan of its generic version of TOPAMAX®. On February 2, 2007, the district court granted Ortho-McNeil’s motion for summary judgment
dismissing Mylan’s claim the patent was obvious, the only remaining issue in the case. The Company expects judgment in the case will shortly be entered for Ortho-McNeil, and that Mylan will then appeal.
In the action against Mylan involving Ortho-McNeil’s product, DITROPAN XL® (oxybutynin chloride), the court in September 2005 found the DITROPAN XL® patent invalid and not infringed by Mylan’s
generic product. Those rulings were affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on September 6, 2006. Mylan and Impax received final FDA approval and launched their products in November 2006.
In the weeks following the adverse ruling in the DITROPAN XL® ANDA litigation against Mylan in September 2005, Johnson & Johnson and ALZA received seven antitrust class action complaints filed by
purchasers of the product. They allege that Johnson & Johnson and ALZA violated the antitrust laws of the various states by knowingly pursuing baseless patent litigation, and thereby delaying entry into the
market by Mylan and Impax.71Table of Contents
In the action against Impax involving its ANDA referencing McNeil-PPC’s product CONCERTA®, McNeil and ALZA Corporation, both subsidiaries of the Company, dismissed with prejudice their claim of
infringement against Impax with respect to its ANDA.
With respect to all of the above matters, the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary involved is vigorously defending the validity and enforceability and asserting the infringement of its own or its licensor’s patents.
Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation
Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries, along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, are defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations
that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average
Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Most of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a Multi-District Litigation (MDL)
in Federal District Court in Boston, Massachusetts. The plaintiffs in these cases include classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state
government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. In the MDL proceeding in Boston, plaintiffs moved for class certification of all or some portion of their claims. On
August 16, 2005, the trial judge certified Massachusetts-only classes of private insurers providing “Medi-gap” insurance coverage and private payers for physician-administered drugs where payments were based
on AWP. The judge also allowed plaintiffs to file a new complaint seeking to name proper parties to represent a national class of individuals who made co-payments for physician-administered drugs covered by
Medicare. The Court of Appeals declined to allow an appeal of those issues and in January 2006, the court certified the national class as noted above. A trial of the two Massachusetts-only class actions concluded
before the Massachusetts District Court in December 2006. A decision is expected in the first quarter of 2007. The trial judge has scheduled jury trials to begin in April 2007 in the national class action on behalf of
individuals who paid co-payments for Medicare Part B drugs. Trial in the action brought by the Attorney General of the State of Alabama making allegations related to AWP is set for November 2007. Additional
AWP cases brought by various Attorney Generals are expected to be set for trial in 2008.
Other

are believed to have made improper payments in connection with the sale of medical devices in two small-market countries, which payments may fall within the jurisdiction of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
The Company will provide additional information to DOJ and SEC, and will cooperate with the agencies’ reviews of these matters.
In September 2004, plaintiffs in an employment discrimination litigation initiated against the Company in 2001 in Federal District Court in New Jersey moved to certify a class of all African American and
Hispanic salaried employees of the Company and its affiliates in the U.S., who were employed at any time from November 1997 to the present. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages for the period 1997 through the
present (including punitive damages) and equitable relief. The Court denied plaintiffs’ class certification motion in December 2006. The plaintiffs have sought reconsideration of that decision. The Company
disputes the allegations in the lawsuit and is vigorously defending against them.The Company, along with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Ethicon, Inc., Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. and HCS are defendants in a federal antitrust action challenging suture and endo-mechanical contracts with
group purchasing organizations and hospitals in which discounts are predicated on a hospital achieving specified market share targets for both categories of products. Trial in that action, Conmed v. Johnson &
Johnson et al. (S.D.N.Y., filed November 6, 2003), is currently scheduled for April 2007. Conmed alleges damages up to $1.8 billion, which damages would be trebled under the antitrust laws if such damages, and
liability, are successfully established at trial. In late December 2005 and early 2006, three purported class actions were filed on behalf of purchasers of endo-mechanical instruments. These actions have been filed
in the Federal District Court for the Central District of California.
In November 2005, Amgen filed suit against Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a declaration that the Roche product CERA, which Roche has
indicated it will seek to introduce into the United States, infringes a number of Amgen patents concerning EPO. Amgen licenses and manufactures EPO for sale in the
73Table of Contents
United States by the Company’s Ortho Biotech Inc. subsidiary for non-dialysis indications. The suit is in its preliminary stages.
In October 2006, Wyeth, Inc. initiated litigation in Delaware against Cordis Corporation alleging that Cordis breached the license and supply agreement pursuant to which Wyeth supplies Cordis the drug
Rapamycin which is used in connection with Cordis’ CYPHER® Sirolimus-eluting Stent. Cordis has commenced its own action in Delaware seeking a declaration that no breach has occurred.
The Company is also involved in a number of other patent, trademark and other lawsuits incidental to its business. The ultimate legal and financial liability of the Company in respect to all claims, lawsuits
and proceedings referred to above cannot be estimated with any certainty. However, in the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the
ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, although the resolution in
any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.
19. Earnings Per Share
The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2006, January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005:
2006 2005 2004
(Shares in Millions Except
Per Share Data)
Basic net earnings per share $ 3.76 3.38 2.76
Average shares outstanding — basic 2,936.4 2,973.9 2,968.4
Potential shares exercisable under stock option plans 207.0 203.1 186.5
Less: shares repurchased under treasury stock method (186.3) (178.6) (174.6)
Convertible debt shares 3.9 4.4 12.4
Adjusted average shares outstanding — diluted 2,961.0 3,002.8 2,992.7
Diluted net earnings per share $ 3.73 3.35 2.74
The diluted net earnings per share calculation includes the dilutive effect of convertible debt: a decrease in interest expense of $4 million, $11 million and $14 million after tax for years 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.
Diluted net earnings per share excludes 43 million, 45 million and 42 million shares underlying stock options for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, as the exercise price of these options was greater than their
average market value, which would result in an anti-dilutive effect on diluted earnings per share.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Under Section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and
report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria
established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework.” These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk
assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its
internal controls over financial reporting.
On December 20, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. Due to the close proximity of the completion date of the acquisition to the date of
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, management excluded the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. from its assessment of internal
control over financial reporting.
The total assets of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc., which were primarily intangible assets and goodwill, represented 26% of the Company’s total assets for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2006.
The operating results of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. acquired on December 20, 2006 will be reported in the Company’s financial statements beginning in 2007, as 2006 results subsequent
to the acquisition date were not significant.
Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2006, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Johnson & Johnson:
We have completed integrated audits of Johnson & Johnson’s consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of earnings, statements of equity, and statements of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Johnson & Johnson and its Subsidiaries (“the Company”) at December 31, 2006, and January 1, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial
statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 13, due to the implementation of SFAS No. 158 the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for pensions and other benefits as of December 31, 2006.
Internal control over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in the accompanying, “Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting,” that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated,
in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of
internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As described in “Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting,” management has excluded the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. from its assessment of internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, because it was acquired by the Company on December 20, 2006. We have also excluded the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. from our audit of internal
control over financial reporting. Total assets of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. represent 26% of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of December 31, 2006./s/ PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTEXHIBIT 99
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM
ACT OF 1995 — “SAFE HARBOR” FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The Company may from time to time make certain forward-looking statements in publicly-released materials, both written and oral. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current
facts and anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words like “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates”
and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations, financial performance, the Company’s strategy for growth, product development, regulatory
approvals, market position and expenditures.
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events. The Company cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be accurate, although the Company believes that it has
been reasonable in its expectations and assumptions. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from
the Company’s expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Furthermore, the Company does not undertake to update any forward-
looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.
Some important factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ from the Company’s expectations in any forward-looking statements are as follows:
Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins;
Competitive factors, including technological advances achieved and patents attained by competitors as well as new products introduced by competitors;
Challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors or allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties, which could potentially affect the Company’s competitive position
and ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of past damages and future royalties. In particular, generic drug firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking to market
generic forms of most of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products, prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event that the Company is not successful in defending the
resulting lawsuits, generic versions of the product at issue will be introduced, resulting in very substantial market share and revenue losses;
Financial distress and bankruptcies experienced by significant customers and suppliers that could impair their ability, as the case may be, to purchase the Company’s products, pay for products
previously purchased or meet their obligations to the Company under supply arrangements;
The impact on political and economic conditions due to terrorist attacks in the U.S. and other parts of the world or U.S. military action overseas, as well as instability in the financial markets which
could result from such terrorism or military actions;
Interruptions of computer and communication systems, including computer viruses, that could impair the Company’s ability to conduct business and communicate internally and with its customers;
Health care changes in the U.S. and other countries resulting in pricing pressures, including the continued consolidation among health care providers, trends toward managed care and health care cost
containment, the shift towards governments becoming the primary payers of health care expenses and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion, reimbursement and pricing generally;
Government laws and regulations, affecting U.S. and foreign operations, including those relating to securities laws compliance, trade, monetary and fiscal policies, taxes, price controls, regulatory
approval of new products, licensing and patent rights, and including, in particular, proposed amendments to theHatch-Waxman Act, implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and possible drug reimportation legislation;
Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant and results from time to time in product and process
obsolescence. The development of new and improved products is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business;
Challenges and difficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals in the
United States and abroad, gain and maintain market approval of products and the possibility of encountering infringement claims by competitors with respect to patent or other intellectual property rights
which can preclude or delay commercialization of a product;
Significant litigation adverse to the Company including product liability claims, patent infringement claims and antitrust claims;
The health care industry has come under increased scrutiny by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and
criminal penalties, including debarment from government business;
Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the FDA (or foreign counterparts) or declining
sales;
The impact of business combinations, including acquisitions and divestitures, both internally for the Company and externally in the pharmaceutical, medical device and health care industries; and
Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact upon the Company’s ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is
not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company has identified the factors on this list as permitted
by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. GRAPHIC 12 y29901y2990109.gif GRAPHIC begin 644 y29901y2990109.gif

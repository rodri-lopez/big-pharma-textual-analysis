<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size="2">The international business of Johnson &#38;
Johnson is conducted by subsidiaries located in 56 countries

&#147;&#151;&nbsp;Medical Devices and Diagnostics.&#148;
However, the principal markets, products and methods of

abroad.

<FONT size="2">Johnson &#38; Johnson has made a practice of
obtaining patent protection on its products and processes where
possible. Johnson &#38; Johnson owns or is licensed under a
number of patents relating to its products and manufacturing
processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material
importance in the operation of its business. Sales of the
Company&#146;s two largest products,
RISPERDAL<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>
and
PROCRIT<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>/EPREX<SUP style="font-size: 85%;
vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>,
accounted for approximately 6% and 7% of Johnson &#38;
Johnson&#146;s total revenues, respectively, for fiscal 2005.
Accordingly, the patents related to these products are believed
to be material in relation to Johnson &#38; Johnson as a whole.

DURAGESIC<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>
(fentanyl transdermal system) in the United States and certain
international markets and
EPREX<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>
(Epoetin alfa) in international markets have lost or will lose
their basic patent protection and are or will be subject to
generic competition.
DURAGESIC<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>
sales declined by 23.9% to $1.6&nbsp;billion in 2005 as compared
to 2004, due to the negative impact of generic competition
primarily in the United States. Regarding
EPREX<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>,
generic competition will be limited in the near term due to the
lack of approved generic compounds. Combined sales of
DURAGESIC<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>
and
EPREX<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">&#174;</SUP>
accounted for approximately 5% of Johnson&nbsp;&#38;

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant
degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the
fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This
reflects increased spending decisions, principally for
advertising and research grants.

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">In all of their product lines, Johnson &#38;
Johnson companies compete with companies both large and small,
located throughout the world. Competition is strong in all
product lines without regard to the number and size of the
competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving
the development and the improvement of new and existing products
and processes, is particularly significant. The development of
new and improved products is important to Johnson &#38;
Johnson&#146;s success in all areas of its business. This
competitive environment requires substantial investments in
continuing research and multiple sales forces. In addition, the
development and maintenance of customer acceptance of the
products of Johnson &#38; Johnson&#146;s consumer businesses
involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.

<FONT size="2">Research activities are important to all segments
of Johnson &#38; Johnson&#146;s business. Major research
facilities are located not only in the United States but also in
Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany,
Japan, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The costs of
worldwide Company-sponsored research activities relating to the
development of new products, improvement of existing products,
technical support of products and compliance with governmental
regulations for the protection of consumers and patients,
excluding in-process research and development charges, amounted
to $6,312&nbsp;million, $5,203&nbsp;million and
$4,684&nbsp;million for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. These costs are charged directly to income in the

companies were subject to a variety of federal, state and local
environmental protection measures. Johnson &#38; Johnson
believes that its operations comply in all material respects
with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Johnson

<P align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<FONT size="2">Most of Johnson &#38; Johnson&#146;s business is
subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the
countries in which operations are conducted, and the general
trend is toward regulation of increasing stringency. In the
United States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic
industries have long been subject to regulation by various
federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety,
efficacy, manufacturing, advertising and labeling. The exercise
of broad regulatory powers by the FDA continues to result in
increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required
for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding
increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends
are also evident in major markets outside of the United States.

initiate product recalls.

The Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company&#146;s
management, including its principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. William&nbsp;C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, and Robert&nbsp;J. Darretta, Vice Chairman and Chief
Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation.
Based on this evaluation, Messrs.&nbsp;Weldon and Darretta
concluded that, as of the date of their evaluation, the

establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over

generally accepted accounting principles.

matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,
internal control over financial reporting determined to be
effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect
all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION
ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS
DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company and its subsidiaries have approximately 115,600 employees worldwide
engaged in the manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health
care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the
world and its primary focus has been on products related to human health and
well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer,
Pharmaceutical, and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. The Consumer segment
manufactures and markets a broad range of products used in the baby and child
care, skin care, oral and wound care and women's health care fields, as well as
nutritional and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. These products are
marketed principally to the general public and sold both to wholesalers and
directly to independent and chain retail outlets throughout the world. The
Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following therapeutic areas:
anti-fungal, anti-infective, cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology,
gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management,
psychotropic (central nervous system) and urology areas. These products are
distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for
prescription use by the general public. The Medical Devices and Diagnostics
segment includes a broad range of products used principally in the professional
fields by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and
clinics. These products include Cordis' circulatory disease management products;
DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal care products; Ethicon's
wound care and women's health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery's minimally
invasive surgical products; LifeScan's blood glucose monitoring products;
Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics' professional diagnostic products and Vision Care's
disposable contact lenses.
The Company's structure is based upon the principle of decentralizedmanagement. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal
management group responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources
of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the
Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments.
Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed
by citizens of the country where it is located.
In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both large
and small, located throughout the world. Competition is strong in all product
lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.
Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new
and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The
development of new and improved products is important to the Company's success
in all areas of its business. This also includes protecting the Company's
portfolio of intellectual property. The competitive environment requires
substantial investments in continuing research and multiple sales forces. In
addition, the development and maintenance of customer acceptance of the
Company's consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising
and promotion.
MANAGEMENT'S OBJECTIVES
The Company's objective is to achieve superior levels of capital efficient
profitable growth. To accomplish this, the Company's management operates the
business consistent with certain strategic principles that have proven
successful over time. To this end, the Company participates in growth areas in
human health care and is committed to attaining leadership positions in these
growth segments through the development of innovative products and services.
New products introduced within the past five years accounted for over 33% of
2005 sales. In 2005, $6.3 billion, or 12.5% of sales were invested in research
and development, an increase of $1.1 billion over 2004. This significant
increase reflects management's commitment to the importance of on-going
development of new and differentiated products and services, and to sustain long
term growth.
With more than 230 operating companies located in 57 countries, the Company
views its principle of decentralized management as an asset and fundamental to
the success of a broadly based business. It also fosters an entrepreneurial
spirit, combining the extensive resources of a large organization with the
ability to react quickly to local market changes and challenges.
The Company is committed to developing global business leaders who can
drive growth objectives. Businesses are managed for the long term in order to
sustain leadership positions and achieve growth that provides an enduring source
of value to our shareholders.
Unifying the management team and the Company's dedicated employees in
achieving these objectives is the Johnson & Johnson Credo. The Credo provides a
common set of values and serves as a constant reminder of the Company's
responsibilities to its customers, employees, communities and shareholders. The
Company believes that these basic principles, along with its overall mission of
improving the quality of life for people everywhere, will enable Johnson &
Johnson to continue to be among the leaders in the health care industry.

and 12.6% in 2003. Sales by international companies were $22.1 billion in 2005,
$19.6 billion in 2004 and $16.6 billion in 2003. This represents an increase of
13.1% in 2005, 18.0% in 2004 and 19.8% in 2003.
PAGE 28 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2005 ANNUAL REPORT
<PAGE>
The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and
international sales were 11.6%, 10.4% and 13.3%, respectively. The ten-year
compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were10.5%, 12.1% and 8.9%, respectively.
All international geographic regions experienced sales growth during 2005,
consisting of 9.3% in Europe, 19.2% in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the
U.S.) and 17.6% in the Asia-Pacific, Africa regions. These sales gains include a
positive impact of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign
currencies in Europe of 0.5%, in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) of
9.2% and in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region of 0.8%.
In 2005, the Company did not have a customer that represented 10% of total
revenues. In 2004, sales to Cardinal Distribution and McKesson HBOC accounted
for 10.2% and 10.0% of total revenues. In 2003, sales to McKesson HBOC accounted
for 10.5% of total revenues.
2004 results benefited from the inclusion of a 53rd week. (See Note 1 for
Annual Closing Date details.) The Company estimated that the fiscal fourth
quarter growth rate in 2004 was enhanced by approximately 2% and the year by
approximately 0.5%. The net earnings impact of the additional week in 2004 was
negligible.
ANALYSIS OF SALES BY BUSINESS SEGMENTS
CONSUMER SEGMENT
Consumer segment sales in 2005 were $9.1 billion, an increase of 9.2%, over 2004
with operational growth accounting for 7.8% of the total growth and 1.4% due to
positive currency fluctuations. U.S. Consumer segment sales were $4.4 billion,
an increase of 4.3%. International sales were $4.7 billion, an increase of
14.2%, with 11.3% as a result of operations and 2.9% due to currency
fluctuations over 2004.
Consumer segment sales growth in 2005 was attributable to strong sales
performance in the major franchises including Over-the-Counter (OTC)
Pharmaceuticals and Nutritionals products, Skin Care, Women's Health and Baby &
Kids Care. OTC franchise sales were $2.7 billion, an increase of 11.8% over
2004. Overall growth in this franchise primarily resulted from the rapid growth
of SPLENDA(R) No Calorie Sweetener in the tabletop category and adult and
pediatric analgesics. This sales growth was partially offset by the negative
impact of retail restrictions implemented on products containing
pseudoephedrine. This will continue to negatively impact the business until
products containing pseudoephedrine are reformulated.
The Skin Care franchise sales in 2005 were $2.4 billion, representing a
12.2% increase over 2004. This was attributable to sales growth in RoC(R),
AVEENO(R), CLEAN & CLEAR(R) and NEUTROGENA(R) brand products. The Women's Health
franchise grew by 6.7% to $1.6 billion in 2005, with strong contributions from
the K-Y(R) and STAYFREE(R) product lines. The Baby & Kids Care franchise grew by
7.9% to $1.6 billion in 2005. Growth in this franchise was led by the success of
the JOHNSON'S(R) SOFTWASH(R) and SOFTLOTION(TM) product lines and
BabyCenter.com(R).

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION PAGE 29
<PAGE>
Consumer segment sales in 2004 were $8.3 billion, an increase of 12.1% over
2003, with operational growth accounting for 8.8% of the total growth, and 3.3%
due to a positive currency impact. U.S. sales increased by 6.5% while
international sales increased by 18.7%, with 11.5% due to operational gains and
a positive currency impact of 7.2% over 2003. Consumer segment sales in 2003
were $7.4 billion, an increase of 13.2% over 2002, with 9.4% of the increase due
to operational growth and 3.8% due to a positive currency impact. U.S. sales
increased by 10.1% while international sales gains were 17.0%, with 8.6% due to
operational gains and a positive currency impact of 8.4%.PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT
Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2005 were $22.3 billion, an increase of 0.9%
over 2004, with 0.4% of this change due to operational growth and the remaining
0.5% increase related to the positive impact of currency. U.S. Pharmaceutical
segment sales decreased 3.2% while international Pharmaceutical segment sales
increased 9.4%, which included 7.8% of operational growth and 1.6% related to
the positive impact of currency.
Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2005 included a benefit from adjustments
related to previously estimated performance based rebate allowances and managed
care contracts. These adjustments were less than 1.0% of sales in both 2005 and
2004.
Sales growth within the segment was led by strong performances from
RISPERDAL(R) (risperidone), REMICADE(R) (infliximab), TOPAMAX(R) (topiramate)
and LEVAQUIN(R) (levofloxacin). However, this growth was offset by generic
competition related to DURAGESIC(R) (fentanyl transdermal system), ULTRACET(R)
(tramadol hydrochloride/acetaminophen), SPORANOX(R) (itraconazole) and hormonal
contraceptives.
A key driver of growth for the segment in 2005 was the continued success of
RISPERDAL(R) (risperidone), and RISPERDAL(R) CONSTA(R) (risperidone), a long
acting injection medication that treats the symptoms of schizophrenia. These
products achieved $3.6 billion in sales, an increase of 16.5% over the prior
year. Ongoing country approvals for the use of RISPERDAL(R) for additional
indications have been a key factor in product growth.
PROCRIT(R) (Epoetin alfa) and EPREX(R) (Epoetin alfa) performance continued
to be adversely affected by competition. Combined, these two products had sales
of $3.3 billion in 2005, a decline of 7.4% as compared to 2004. Volume
associated with share loss to competitive products was the primary driver of the
decline.
REMICADE(R) (infliximab), a biologic approved for the treatment of Crohn's
disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and use in the treatment of rheumatoid and
psoriatic arthritis experienced sales of $2.5 billion, with strong growth of
18.2% over the prior year. The U.S. FDA granted approval for REMICADE(R) to be
used in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, during the fiscal second quarter
of 2005. REMICADE(R) received approval for the treatment of ulcerative colitis
by the FDA in the fiscal third quarter of 2005 and by the European Commission in
the fiscal first quarter of 2006. Additionally, the European Commission granted
approval for use in the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis during the fiscal
fourth quarter of 2005. These approvals contributed to strong growth of
REMICADE(R) in 2005.
Sales of TOPAMAX(R) (topiramate), which has been approved for adjunctive
use in epilepsy, as well as for the prophylactic treatment of migraines,
accounted for $1.7 billion in sales, achieving strong growth of 19.1% over the
prior year. In June of 2005, TOPAMAX(R) was also approved by the FDA for use as
an initial monotherapy in the treatment of epilepsy.
DURAGESIC(R) (fentanyl transdermal system) sales declined to $1.6 billion
in 2005, a 23.9% reduction over 2004, primarily driven by the negative impact of
generic competition in the U.S. beginning in January 2005. Additionally, generic
versions of DURAGESIC(R) have been launched in Europe. An authorized generic
version of DURAGESIC(R), being marketed for the Company in the U.S., was
launched in the fiscal first quarter of 2005.
LEVAQUIN(R) (levofloxacin) and FLOXIN(R) (ofloxacin) achieved combined
sales of $1.5 billion in 2005, representing growth of 15.2% over the prior year,
benefiting from strong market growth. During the fiscal third quarter of 2005,
LEVAQUIN(R) obtained FDA approval for short course treatment of acute bacterial
sinusitis.
The hormonal contraceptive franchise accounted for $1.1 billion in sales,
declining by 11.1% over the prior year. Reduced sales of ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN(R)
(norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol), resulting from generic competition, were
partially offset by strong growth in ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN(R) LO
(norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol), a low dose oral contraceptive. While there was
an overall sales increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 in ORTHO EVRA(R)
(norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol), the first contraceptive patch approved by
the FDA, labeling changes and negative media coverage concerning product safety
are expected to impact sales in 2006.

CONCERTA(R) (methylphenidate HCl), a product for the treatment of attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, achieved sales of $0.8 billion in 2005,
representing an increase of 11.4% over 2004. At present, the FDA has not
approved any generic version that is substitutable for CONCERTA(R). Abbreviated
New Drug Applications (ANDAs) for generic versions of CONCERTA(R) are pending
and may be approved at any time. Recent negative publicity and FDA activities
concerning attention deficit hyperactivity products may impact CONCERTA(R)
sales in 2006.
NATRECOR(R) (nesiritide), a product for the treatment of patients with
acutely decompensated congestive heart failure who have dyspnea at rest or with
minimal activity, has experienced a significant decline in demand due to recent
negative media coverage regarding a meta analysis of selected historical
clinical trials. The Company believes that there are no new data supporting the
conclusions of these medical and consumer publications and the currently
approved label for NATRECOR(R) reflects all available data to date. In response,
the Company assembled an expert panel to review the available data and clinical
development plans for the product and engaged in dialogue with the FDA. Both the
panel and the FDA support the continued appropriate use of NATRECOR(R).
NATRECOR(R), a Scios Inc. product, was purchased by the Company in 2003 and
resulted in the recording of an intangible asset, which is being amortized over
15 years. The remaining unamortized intangible value associated with NATRECOR(R)
was $1.1 billion at the end of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2005, and based on
the current estimate of projected future cash flows, no adjustment to this
intangible asset is required.
Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2004 included the benefit from adjustments
related to previously estimated performance-based rebate allowances in managed
care contracts. These adjustments were made based on a review of actual
performance levels as achieved by customers, compared to expected performance
levels. These favorable adjustments amounted to less than one percentage point
of the Pharmaceutical segment's operational growth in 2004. The vast majority of
the impact of this adjustment was in the hormonal contraceptive franchise.
Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2004 were $22.1 billion, an increase of
13.4% over 2003, with 10.7% of this change due to operational growth and the
remaining 2.7% increase related to the positive impact of currency. U.S.
Pharmaceutical segment sales increased 12.7% while international Pharmaceutical
segment sales increased 14.8%, which included 6.4% growth operationally and 8.4%
related to the positive impact of currency. Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2003
were $19.5 billion, an increase of 13.8% over 2002, with 9.7% due to operational
growth and 4.1% due to positive currency fluctuations. U.S. sales increased by
11.3% while international sales grew 19.4% over 2002. This included operational
growth of 6.0% and a 13.4% positive impact from currency.
MEDICAL DEVICES AND DIAGNOSTICS SEGMENT
The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment achieved sales of $19.1 billion in
2005, representing an increase over the prior year of 13.1%, with operational
growth of 12.5% and a positive impact from currency of 0.6%. U.S. sales
increased 10.6% while international sales increased 15.7%, with 14.5% from
operations and 1.2% from currency.
Strong sales growth in the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment was
achieved by multiple franchises.
The Cordis franchise was a key contributor to the segment results with
reported sales of $4.0 billion, an increase of 24.0% over the prior year. The
primary growth driver of the Cordis franchise was the CYPHER(R)
Sirolimus-eluting Stent in both U.S. and international markets, with excellent
growth in Japan. Biosense Webster also contributed to the success of the Cordis
franchise, with continued solid double-digit growth. During the fiscal fourth
quarter of 2005, Biosense Webster received approval for the use of the
CELSIUS(TM) RMT diagnostic ablation steerable tip catheter.In April and July of 2004, the Cordis Cardiology Division of Cordis
Corporation received warning letters from the FDA regarding Good Manufacturing
Practice regulations and Good Clinical Practice regulations. These observations
followed post-approval site inspections completed in 2003 and early 2004,
including sites involved in the production of the CYPHER(R) Sirolimus-eluting
Stent. In response to the warning letters, Cordis has made improvements to its
quality systems and anticipates follow-up site inspections in the fiscal first
and second quarters of 2006.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION PAGE 31
<PAGE>
The DePuy franchise reported $3.8 billion in sales, which represents 12.5%
growth over the prior year. Double-digit growth in DePuy's orthopaedic joint
reconstruction unit led the increase for this franchise. Strong sales growth was
also achieved in DePuy's spine unit and Mitek sports medicine products.
The Ethicon worldwide franchise achieved $3.1 billion of sales in 2005,
representing 9.3% growth over the prior year. Contributing to the strong results
was the continued growth of suture and mesh products, including VICRYL(R)
(polyglactin 910) Plus, an anti-bacterial coated suture, MULTIPASS(R) Needles
and PROCEED(R) tissue separating mesh.
The Ethicon Endo-Surgery franchise reported $3.1 billion of sales in 2005,
representing 8.7% growth over the prior year. This growth was mainly driven by
endocutter sales that include products used in performing bariatric procedures
for the treatment of obesity, an important focus area for the franchise.
Double-digit sales increases in the Advanced Sterilization Products line were
also a key contributor to the overall sales growth of the franchise.
The LifeScan franchise reported $1.9 billion of sales in 2005, a growth
rate of 12.3% over the prior year. The ONETOUCH(R) ULTRA(R) product line
achieved strong growth in 2005.
The Vision Care franchise achieved $1.7 billion of sales in 2005, which was
a growth rate of 10.7% over the prior year, led by the continued success of
ACUVUE(R) ADVANCE(TM) Brand Contact Lenses with HYDRACLEAR(TM) and 1-DAY
ACUVUE(R). An additional contributor was ACUVUE(R) OASYS(TM) with
HYDRACLEAR(TM), for tired and dry eyes, which was launched in the fiscal third
quarter of 2005.
The Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics franchise reported $1.4 billion of sales in
2005, representing 10.6% growth over the prior year. This growth was mainly
driven by the continued market penetration of automated blood typing products,
ongoing growth of the ECI product line and the success of the VITROS(R) 5, 1 FS
Clinical Chemistry system.
The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment achieved sales of $16.9 billion
in 2004, representing an increase over the prior year of 13.2%, with operational
growth of 9.0% and a positive impact from currency of 4.2%. U.S. sales increased
6.9% while international sales increased 20.7%, with 11.4% from operations and
9.3% from currency. In 2003, the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment
achieved sales of $14.9 billion, representing an increase over the prior year of
18.5% with operational growth of 12.8% and a positive impact from currency of
5.7%. U.S. sales increased 15.9% while international sales increased 21.7%, with
9.0% from operations and 12.7% from currency.
ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS BEFORE PROVISION FOR TAXES ON INCOME
Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income increased to $13.7
billion, or 6.4%, over the $12.8 billion earned in 2004. The increase in 2004
was 24.5% over the $10.3 billion in 2003. As a percent to sales, consolidated
earnings before provision for taxes on income in 2005 was 27.0%, representing a
decrease of 0.1% over the 27.1% in 2004. For 2004, the improvement was 2.5% over
the 24.6% in 2003, and the decline in 2003 was 1.0% over 2002. The sections thatfollow highlight the significant components of the changes in consolidated
earnings before provision for taxes on income.
COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD AND SELLING, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES: Cost
of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent

-----
</TABLE>
In 2005, there was a decrease in the percent to sales of cost of products sold.
This was due to lower manufacturing costs primarily related to the CYPHER(R)
Sirolimus-eluting Stent, as well as ongoing cost containment activity across the
organization, partially offset by the negative impact of pharmaceutical product
mix. There was also a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and
administrative expenses. This was due to cost containment initiatives in the
Pharmaceutical segment partially offset by increases in investment spending in
the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment.
In 2004, there was a decrease in the percent to sales of cost of products
sold. This was due to favorable mix, as well as cost improvement initiatives.
There was also a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and
administrative expenses. This was due to the Company's focus on managing
expenses, partially offset by an increase in investment spending across a number
of businesses focused on driving future growth. In 2003, there was no change in
the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses and an
increase in the percent to sales of cost of products sold. This was due to the
changes in the mix of products with varying cost structures, as well as the cost
of the retirement enhancement program of $95 million expensed in the fiscal
fourth quarter of 2003.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT: Research activities represent a significant part of
the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the development of new
products, improvement of existing products, technical support of products and
compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of consumers and
patients. Worldwide costs of research activities, excluding in process research
and development charges, were as follows:

Research activities accelerated in the Pharmaceutical segment, increasing
to $4.4 billion, or 22.3%, over 2004. The compound annual growth rate was
approximately 16.4% for the five-year period since 2000.
The increased investment in research and development in all segments
demonstrates the Company's focus on knowledge based products, and reflects a
significant number of projects in late stage development.

related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities
held by Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation, gains and losses on the
disposal of property, plant and equipment, currency gains and losses, minority
interests, litigation settlement (income) expense and royalty income. The change
in net other (income) expense from 2004 to 2005 was an increase in income of
$229 million.
For 2005, the other income balance of $214 million included royalty income
partially offset by several expense items, none of which were individually
significant.
For 2004, the other expense balance of $15 million included several expense
items, none of which were individually significant, partially offset by royalty

segment operating profit. Also included in the Medical Devices and Diagnostics
segment operating profit was the gain on the sale of various product lines that
were no longer compatible with this segment's strategic goals. Other income for
2003 also included the recovery of a $40 million loan, previously written off,
included in the Pharmaceutical segment operating profit.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION PAGE 33
<PAGE>
CONSUMER SEGMENT: Consumer segment operating profit in 2005 increased 10.1% over
the prior year. As a percent to sales, 2005 increased slightly to 18.3%, despite
increases in investment spending in advertising and research and development.
Consumer segment operating profit in 2004 increased 8.7% over the prior year. As
a percent to sales, 2004 experienced a decrease of 0.5% from 2003, primarily due
to additional investment in consumer promotions and advertising in the
Over-the-Counter Pharmaceuticals and Nutritionals franchise.
PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT: In 2005, Pharmaceutical segment operating profit
decreased 13.1%, and as a percent to sales declined 4.8% from 2004 to 29.6%.
This change was primarily due to increased investment in research and
development spending, as well as the impact of $302 million of IPR&D expenses in
2005. In 2004, Pharmaceutical segment operating profit increased 29.0% and
reflected an operating profit as a percent to sales improvement of 4.2% over
2003 to 34.4%. This change was primarily due to the impact of $737 million of
IPR&D expenses in 2003.
MEDICAL DEVICES AND DIAGNOSTICS SEGMENT: In 2005, the Medical Devices and
Diagnostics segment operating profit increased 32.4%, and as a percent to sales
increased 4.2% from 2004 to 28.4%. This increase was driven by improved gross
margins due to cost reduction programs and product mix, primarily related to the
CYPHER(R) Sirolimus-eluting Stent. This was partially offset by an increased
investment in research and development spending. In 2004, the Medical Devices
and Diagnostics segment operating profit increased 21.4%. The increase over the
prior year was achieved through improved gross margins, resulting from cost
reduction programs and product mix, and the impact of $181 million of IPR&D
expenses related to acquisitions in 2003.
INTEREST (INCOME) EXPENSE: Interest income in 2005 increased by $292 million due
primarily to higher rates of interest, as well as a higher average cash balance.
The cash balance, including current marketable securities, was $16.1 billion at
the end of 2005 and averaged $14.3 billion, as compared to the $11.3 billion
average cash balance in 2004.
Interest expense in 2005 decreased as compared to 2004 due in part to a
decrease in the average debt balance, from $3.5 billion in 2004 to $2.6 billion
in 2005.
Interest income in 2004 increased by $18 million due primarily to a higher
cash balance. The cash and marketable securities combined balance at the end of
2004 was $12.9 billion and averaged $11.3 billion, which is significantly higher
than the $8.6 billion average cash balance in 2003.
Interest expense in 2004 decreased by $20 million as compared to 2003
primarily due to a decrease in the average debt balance, from $5.0 billion in
2003 to $3.5 billion in 2004.
PROVISION FOR TAXES ON INCOME: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 23.8%
in 2005, 33.7% in 2004 and 30.2% in 2003. The decrease in the tax rate was
attributable to a tax benefit of $225 million, recorded in 2005, related to a
technical correction associated with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
Also contributing to the decrease in the 2005 tax rate was the increase in
taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to taxable income in higher
tax jurisdictions, as a result of increased expenditures in higher tax
jurisdictions and a shift in sales mix. These benefits were partially offset by
non-deductible IPR&D charges. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2004 was
primarily due to the $789 million tax cost on the intended repatriation of
undistributed international earnings associated with the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004, which added 6.1% to the effective income tax rate.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
CASH FLOWS
Cash generated from operations and selected borrowings provide the major
sources of funds for the growth of the business, including working capital,
capital expenditures and acquisitions. Other uses of cash include share
repurchases, dividends and debt repayments.
In 2005, cash flow from operations was $11.9 billion, an increase of $0.7
billion over 2004. The increase in cash generated from operations was a result
of a net income increase of $2.2 billion, net of the non-cash impact of IPR&D
charges. A $1.0 billion decrease in other current and non-current assets alsocontributed to this increase. This was partially offset by a $1.5 billion
decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Additionally, cash
payments of approximately $0.5 billion were made for previously accrued taxes on
the repatriation of undistributed international earnings in accordance with the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. There was also an increase of approximately
$0.2 billion in pension funding in 2005 as compared to 2004.
Net cash used for investing activities decreased by $2.1 billion in 2005
due to a $3.1 billion net increase in the sales of investments. This was
partially offset by a $0.5 billion increase in capital expenditures and a $0.4
billion increase in acquisition activity. For a more detailed discussion on
mergers and acquisitions, see Note 17.
Net cash used for financing activities decreased by $0.6 billion in 2005
due to a net issuance of debt partially offset by an increase in dividends and
increased levels of common stock repurchases.
Cash and current marketable securities were $16.1 billion at the end of
2005 as compared with $12.9 billion at the end of 2004.
Cash generated from operations amounted to $11.1 billion in 2004, which was
$0.5 billion more than the cash generated from operations in 2003 of $10.6
billion. The major factor contributing to the increase was a net income increase
of $0.4 billion, net of the non-cash impact of IPR&D charges.

FINANCING AND MARKET RISK
The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange
rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign
exchange contracts to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and
liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency product costs. Gains or losses
on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying
transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 1, 2006
market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company's forward
contracts by $267 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar
from the January 1, 2006 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the
Company's forward contracts by $326 million. In either scenario, the gain or
loss on the forward contract would be offset by the change in value of the
forecasted transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future earnings
and cash flows.
The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates,
and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by
entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S.
and foreign interest rates on the Company's interest rate sensitive financial
instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the
Company's swap contracts by approximately $60 million. In either scenario, at
maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or
loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future
earnings or cash flows.
The Company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with
parties that have at least an "A" (or equivalent) credit rating. The
counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is
no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Management
believes the risk of loss is remote.
Total unused credit available to the Company approximates $3.6 billion,
including $1.5 billion of credit commitments, of which $0.75 billion expire
September 28, 2006 and $0.75 billion expire September 29, 2010. Also included
are $0.8 billion of uncommitted lines with various banks worldwide that expire
during 2006.
Total borrowings at the end of 2005 and 2004 were $2.7 billion and $2.8
billion, respectively. In 2005, net cash (cash and current marketable
securities, net of debt) was $13.5 billion compared to net cash of $10.0 billion
in 2004. Total debt represented 6.6% of total capital (shareholders' equity and
total debt) in 2005 and 8.2% of total capital in 2004. Shareholders' equity per
share at the end of 2005 was $12.73 compared with $10.71 at year-end 2004, an
increase of 18.9%.
On August 19, 2005, Scios Inc. exercised its right to redeem all of its
outstanding $150 million original principal amount of 5.50% Convertible
Subordinated Notes due in 2009. The redemption price was 103.143% of the
principal amount or $1,031.43 per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures, with
accrued interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption.
For the period ended January 1, 2006, there were no material cash
commitments. Johnson & Johnson continues to be one of a few industrial companies
with a Triple A credit rating. A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 6.
LONG-TERM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS
The Company has long-term contractual obligations, primarily lease, debt
obligations and unfunded retirement plans, with no other significant
obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from
operations. The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations
and their aggregate maturities as of January 1, 2006 (see Notes 4, 6 and 13 forfurther details):

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION PAGE 35
<PAGE>
OTHER INFORMATION
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial
condition are based on the Company's consolidated financial statements that have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues,
expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may
or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the
understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in
achieving more insight into the Company's operating results and financial
condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income
taxes, legal and self insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets
and assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other
employee benefit plans and accounting for stock options.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when
goods are shipped or delivered and title and risk of loss pass to the customer.
Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons,
product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in
sales in the same period the related sales are recorded.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with
direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions,
including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, the largest being the Medicaid
rebate provision, are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience,
trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served.
The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products
primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third party sell-through
and market research data, as well as internally generated information.
Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded basedon historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales
or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are
specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales
return accruals.
The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain
products. For all years presented, service revenues were less than 2% of total
revenues and are included in sales to customers.
INCOME TAXES: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable
for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP
accounting and U.S. tax reporting that are recorded as deferred tax assets or
liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on
current tax regulations and rates. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect
recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management believes
that changes in these estimates would not result in a material effect on the
Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In 2005, the Company repatriated the previously disclosed $10.8 billion of
undistributed international earnings in accordance with the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA), and recorded a tax charge of $789 million during
the fiscal fourth quarter of 2004. During the fiscal second quarter of 2005, the
Company recorded a tax benefit of $225 million, due to the reversal of the tax
liability previously recorded during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2004,
associated with a technical correction made to the AJCA in May 2005. At January
1, 2006 and January 2, 2005, the cumulative amount of undistributed
international earnings were approximately $12.0 billion and $18.6 billion,
respectively. The Company intends to continue to reinvest its undistributed
international earnings to expand its international operations; therefore, no
U.S. tax expense has been recorded to cover the undistributed portion not
intended for repatriation.
LEGAL AND SELF INSURANCE CONTINGENCIES: The Company records accruals for various
contingencies including legal proceedings and product liability cases as these
arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management's
judgment as to the probability of losses, opinions of legal counsel and, where
applicable, actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records
insurance receivable amounts from third party insurers when recovery is
probable. As appropriate, reserves against these receivables are recorded for
estimated amounts that may not be collected from third party insurers.
LONG-LIVED AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS: The Company assesses changes in economic
conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in
evaluating the value of the Company's property, plant and equipment, goodwill
and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time,
it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges. In
fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, certain tangible and intangible assets were
written down to fair value with the resulting charge recorded in cost of
products sold, which was insignificant.
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension
plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity
plans, that cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions
for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, expected salary increases
and health care cost trend rates. See Note 13 for further detail on these rates
and the effect a rate change would have on the Company's results of operations.
PAGE 36 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2005 ANNUAL REPORT
<PAGE>
STOCK OPTIONS: The Company has elected to use Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), that does not
require compensation costs related to stock options to be charged against net
income, as all options granted under the various stock options plans had an
exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock at grant
date. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 148 Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure-an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123, requires pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per
share determined as if the fair value method of accounting for stock options had
been applied in measuring compensation cost. See Notes 1 and 10 for further
information regarding stock options.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. This
statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an
entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services. It focuses
primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee
services in share-based payment transactions (such as employee stock options and
restricted stock units). The statement requires the measurement of the cost of
employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments (such
as employee stock options and restricted stock units) at fair value on the grant
date. That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee isrequired to provide services in exchange for the award (the requisite service
period). On April 14, 2005 the SEC approved a new rule that delayed the
effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) for annual, rather than interim, periods that
begin after June 15, 2005. As a result, the Company will adopt this statement in
the fiscal first quarter of 2006.
Upon adoption of this standard, the Company currently intends to apply the
modified retrospective transition method. Previously reported financial
statements will be restated to reflect SFAS No. 123 disclosure amounts. As
required by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation-Transition
and Disclosure-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, the Company has
disclosed the net income and earnings per share effect had the Company applied
the fair value recognition provision of SFAS No. 123. The disclosure impact in
2005 and 2004 was compensation expense, net of tax, of $351 million and $329
million and earnings per share of $0.12 and $0.11, respectively.
The Company will implement SFAS 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB
No. 43 in the fiscal first quarter of 2006. The Company believes the adoption of
this statement will not have a material effect on its results of operations,
cash flows or financial position.
The Company implemented FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, during the fiscal
fourth quarter of 2005. The implementation of this Standard did not have a
material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
The Company implemented SFAS 153, Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets, an
amendment of APB 29 during the fiscal third quarter of 2005, which did not have
a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
The following accounting pronouncements became effective in 2004 and did
not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or
financial position.
- - EITF Issue 02-14: Whether an Investor should apply the Equity Method of
Accounting to Investments other than Common Stock.
- - EITF Issue 04-1: Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the
Parties to a Business Combination.
The following accounting pronouncements became effective in 2003 and did
not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or
financial position.
- - FSP FAS No. 106-1: Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
- - SFAS No. 149: Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.
- - FIN 46 and FIN 46(R): Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - an
interpretation of ARB No. 51.
ECONOMIC AND MARKET FACTORS
Johnson & Johnson is aware that its products are used in an environment where,
for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed
concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns,
Johnson & Johnson has a long standing policy of pricing products responsibly.
For the period 1995-2005, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual
growth rate of Johnson & Johnson net price increases for health care products
(prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products)
was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).
Inflation rates, even though moderate in many parts of the world during
2005, continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on
the way companies operate. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives
to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity
improvements and periodic price increases. The Company faces various worldwide
health care changes that may result in pricing pressures that include health
care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions
and reimbursement.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION PAGE 37
<PAGE>
The Company also operates in an environment which has become increasingly
hostile to intellectual property rights. Generic drug firms have filed
Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking to market generic forms of most of the
Company's key pharmaceutical products, prior to expiration of the applicable
patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in
defending the patent claims challenged in Abbreviated New Drug Application
filings, the generic firms will then introduce generic versions of the product
at issue, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue
losses for that product. For further information see the discussion on
"Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications" in Note 18.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company is involved in numerous product liability cases in the U.S., many of
which concern adverse reactions to drugs and medical devices. The damagesclaimed are substantial, and while the Company is confident of the adequacy of
the warnings and instructions for use which accompany such products, it is not
feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. However, the Company
believes that if any liability results from such cases, it will be substantially
covered by existing amounts accrued in the Company's balance sheet, and where
available by third-party product liability insurance.
The Company is also involved in a number of patent, trademark and other
lawsuits incidental to its business. The ultimate legal and financial liability
of the Company in respect to all claims, lawsuits and proceedings referred to
above cannot be estimated with any certainty. However, in the Company's opinion,
based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and
discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of
liabilities already accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, although the
resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a
significant impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for
that period.
See Note 18 for further information regarding legal proceedings.

CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS
This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and anticipate
results based on management's plans that are subject to uncertainty.
Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words like "plans,"
"expects," "will," "anticipates," "estimates" and other words of similar meaning
in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations,
financial performance, the Company's strategy for growth, product development,
regulatory approval, market position and expenditures.
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future
events. The Company cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be
accurate, although the Company believes that it has been reasonable in its
expectations and assumptions. Investors should realize that if underlying
assumptions prove inaccurate or that unknown risks or uncertainties materialize,
actual results could vary materially from the Company's expectations and
projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on
any forward-looking statements. The Company assumes no obligation to update any
forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or
developments.
Risks and uncertainties include general industry conditions and
competition; economic conditions, such as interest rate and currency exchange
rate fluctuations; technological advances, new products and patents attained by
competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining
regulatory approvals; challenges to patents; U.S. and foreign health care
reforms and governmental laws and regulations; trends toward health care cost
containment; increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government
agencies; product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls or
regulatory action.
The Company's report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 1, 2006
includes Exhibit 99(b), a discussion of additional factors that could cause
actual results to differ from expectations. The Company notes these factors as
permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson
and subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company and its subsidiaries have approximately 115,600 employees worldwide
engaged in the manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health
care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the
world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and
well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer,
Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. The Consumer segment
manufactures and markets a broad range of products used in the baby and child
care, skin care, oral and wound care and women's health care fields, as well as
nutritional and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. These products are
marketed principally to the general public and sold both to wholesalers and
directly to independent and chain retail outlets throughout the world. The
Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following therapeutic areas:
anti-fungal, anti-infective, cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology,
gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management,
psychotropic (central nervous system) and urology areas. These products are
distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for
prescription use by the general public. The Medical Devices and Diagnostics
segment includes a broad range of products used principally in the professional
fields by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and
clinics. These products include Cordis' circulatory disease management products;
DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal care products; Ethicon's
wound care and women's health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery's minimally
invasive surgical products; LifeScan's blood glucose monitoring products;
Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics' professional diagnostic products and Vision Care's
disposable contact lenses.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. This
statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an
entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services. It focuses
primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee
services in share-based payment transactions (such as employee stock options and
restricted stock units). The statement requires the measurement of the cost of
employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments (such
as employee stock options and restricted stock units) at fair value on the grant
date. That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is
required to provide services in exchange for the award (the requisite service
period). On April 14, 2005 the SEC approved a new rule that delayed the
effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) for annual, rather than interim, periods that
begin after June 15, 2005. As a result, the Company will adopt this statement in
the fiscal first quarter of 2006.
Upon adoption of this standard, the Company currently intends to apply the
modified retrospective transition method. Previously reported financial
statements will be restated to reflect SFAS No. 123 disclosure amounts. As
required by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation-Transition
and Disclosure-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, the Company has disclosed
the net earnings and earnings per share effect had the Company applied the fair
value recognition provision of SFAS No. 123. The disclosure impact in 2005 and
2004 was compensation expense, net of tax, of $351 million and $329 million and
earnings per share of $0.12 and $0.11, respectively.
The Company will implement SFAS 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB
No. 43 in the fiscal first quarter of 2006. The Company believes the adoption of
this statement will not have a material effect on its results of operations,
cash flows or financial position.
The Company implemented FIN 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, during the fiscal
fourth quarter of 2005. The implementation of this Standard did not have a
material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
The Company implemented SFAS 153, Exchanges of Non-monetary Assets, an
amendment of APB 29 during the fiscal third quarter of 2005, which did not have
a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financialposition.
The following accounting pronouncements became effective in 2004 and did
not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or
financial position.
- - EITF Issue 02-14: Whether an Investor should apply the Equity Method of
Accounting to Investments other than
Common Stock.
- - EITF Issue 04-1: Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the
Parties to a Business Combination.
The following accounting pronouncements became effective in 2003 and did
not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or
financial position.
- - FSP FAS No. 106-1: Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
- - SFAS No. 149: Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.
- - FIN 46 and FIN 46(R): Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities-an
interpretation of ARB No. 51.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers securities with maturities of three months or less, when
purchased, to be cash equivalents.
INVESTMENTS
Short-term marketable securities are carried at cost, which approximates fair
value. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated
fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. Long-term debt securities that the
Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity are carried at
amortized cost, which also approximates fair value.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PAGE 43
<PAGE>
Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt
and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such
determination at each balance sheet date. The Company periodically reviews its
investments in equity securities for impairment and adjusts these investments to
their fair value when a decline in market value is deemed to be other than
temporary.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the
straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the
assets:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
<S> <C>
Building and building equipment 20-40 years
Land and leasehold improvements 10-20 years
Machinery and equipment 2-13 years
</TABLE>
The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs,
included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with developing
or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are
amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range
from 3 to 5 years.
The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using
undiscounted cash flows. When necessary, charges for impairments of long-lived
assets are recorded for the amount by which the present value of future cash
flows is less than the carrying value of these assets.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the goods are shipped or
delivered and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for
certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns
and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same
period the related sales are recorded.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with
direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions,
including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, the largest being the Medicaid
rebate provision, are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience,
trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served.
The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products
primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third party sell-through
and market research data, as well as internally generated information.
Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historicalsales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return
patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically
investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.
The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products and
includes it in sales to customers.
SHIPPING AND HANDLING
Shipping and handling costs incurred were $736 million, $679 million and $604
million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are included in selling,
marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for
shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods
presented.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined by the
first-in, first-out method.
GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2002 in accordance with SFAS No. 142,
the Company discontinued the amortization relating to all existing goodwill and
indefinite lived intangible assets, which are non-amortizable. SFAS No. 142
requires that goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets be assessed
annually for impairment. The Company completed the annual impairment test for
2005 in the fiscal fourth quarter and no impairment was determined. Future
impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or
sooner if a triggering event occurs.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized
over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by
economic conditions. See Note 7 for further details on Intangible Assets.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for
Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, and SFAS No. 149,
Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 133 requires that all
derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes
in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or
other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as
part of a hedge transaction, and if so, what type of hedge transaction.
The Company uses forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the
variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate
changes of future intercompany product and third party purchases of raw
materials denominated in foreign currency. The Company also uses currency swaps
to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both of these types of
derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company uses
forward exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency
assets and liabilities. These forward exchange contracts are not designated as
hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are
recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the
related foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date into the
derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly
effective. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a
cash flow hedge and is highly effective are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are
then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. The
fair value of a derivative instrument (i.e. Forward Foreign Exchange Contract,
Currency Swap) is the aggregation, by currency, of all
PAGE 44 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2005 ANNUAL REPORT
<PAGE>
future cash flows discounted to its present value at prevailing market interest
rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. dollar at the current spot foreign
exchange rate.
On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues
to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items.
If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge
accounting is discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in
current period earnings, and was insignificant in 2005, 2004 and 2003.
The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and
derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for
undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of
this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure's impact on the
Company's financial performance; (2) protect the Company's cash flow from
adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness offinancial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with
financial institutions.
PRODUCT LIABILITY
Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis,
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. The
accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available.
As a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the
Company ceased purchasing third party product liability insurance. Based on the
availability of prior coverage, receivables for insurance recoveries related to
product liability claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis, when it is
probable that a recovery will be realized.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Upfront and
milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and
development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of
regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory
approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the
related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other
intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.
ADVERTISING
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are
included in the selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising
expenses worldwide, which are comprised of television, radio, print media and
Internet advertising, were $2.1 billion in 2005, $1.9 billion in 2004 and $1.7
billion in 2003.
INCOME TAXES
The Company intends to continue to reinvest its undistributed international
earnings to expand its international operations; therefore, no U.S. tax expense
has been recorded to cover the undistributed portion not intended for
repatriation. At January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005, the cumulative amount of
undistributed international earnings were approximately $12.0 billion and $18.6
billion, respectively.
Deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences of temporary
differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates, applicable to future years,
to differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of existing
assets and liabilities.
NET EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic net earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period. Diluted net earnings per share reflects the potential dilution
that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock
using the treasury stock method.
STOCK OPTIONS
At January 1, 2006, the Company had 17 stock-based employee compensation plans
that are described in Note 10. The Company accounts for those plans under the
recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principle Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and its related
Interpretations. Compensation costs are not recorded in net earnings for stock
options as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to
the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.
As required by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123,
the following table shows the estimated effect on net income and earnings per
share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provision of SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee
compensation.

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used
when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product
liabilities, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits,
contingencies and asset and liability valuations. For instance, in determining
annual pension and post-employment benefit costs, the Company estimates the rate
of return on plan assets, and the cost of future health care benefits. Actual
results may or may not differ from those estimates.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PAGE 45
<PAGE>
ANNUAL CLOSING DATE
The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year which ends on the Sunday
nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists
of 52 weeks, but every five or six years, the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks,
as was the case in 2004.
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year
presentation.

written down to fair value during fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, with the
resulting charge included in amortization expense. The estimated amortization
expense for the five succeeding years approximates $565 million before tax, per

During 2005, the Company had subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico under various
tax incentive grants. Also, the U.S. possessions tax credit, which expires in
2006, applies to certain operations in Puerto Rico. In addition, the Company had
subsidiaries manufacturing in Ireland under an incentive tax rate. During the
second quarter of 2005, a tax benefit of $225 million was recorded due to the
reversal of a tax liability related to a technical correction associated with
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The decrease in the 2005 tax rate was
attributed to increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to
taxable income in higher tax jurisdictions, as a result of increased
expenditures in higher tax jurisdictions and a shift in sales mix.

9. INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY TRANSLATION
For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. dollar currencies, the
Company has determined that the local currencies of its international
subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary
economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates
of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial
portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency.
In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects
are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. This
equity account includes the results of translating all balance sheet assets and
liabilities at current exchange rates, except for those located in highly
inflationary economies that are reflected in operating results.
An analysis of the changes during 2005 and 2004 for foreign currency
translation adjustments is included in Note 12.
Net currency transaction and translation gains and losses included in other
(income) expense were losses of $32 million, $38 million, and $22 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
10. COMMON STOCK, STOCK OPTION PLANS AND STOCK COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS

these plans except the 2000 Stock Option Plan and 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan.
The 2000 Stock Option Plan expired April 19, 2005. All options granted
subsequent to that date were under the 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan.
Stock options expire 10 years from the date they are granted and vest over
service periods that range from one to five years. All options are granted at
current market price on the date of grant. Under the 2005 Long Term Incentive
Plan, the Company may issue up to 260 million shares of common stock. Shares
available for future grants under the 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan were 259.2
million at the end of 2005.

was $160 million in 2005. The tax effect on the gains/(losses) on derivatives
and hedges are a loss of $11 million in 2005 and benefits of $81 million and
$99 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. See Note 15 for additional
information relating to derivatives and hedging.
The currency translation adjustments are not currently adjusted for income
taxes as they relate to permanent investments in international subsidiaries.
13. PENSIONS AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS
The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined
benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most
employees worldwide. The Company also provides postretirement benefits,
primarily health care, to all U.S. retired employees and their dependents.
Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs
for which the direct cost to the Company is not significant.
Retirement plan benefits are primarily based on the employee's compensation
during the last three to five years before retirement and the number of years of
service. International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited
with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts or reserves are
provided.
The Company does not fund retiree health care benefits in advance and has
the right to modify these plans in the future.
The Company uses the date of its consolidated financial statements (January
1, 2006 and January 2, 2005, respectively) as the measurement date for all U.S.
and international retirement and other benefit plans.
Net periodic benefit cost for the Company's defined benefit retirement
plans and other benefit plans for 2005, 2004 and 2003 included the following
components:<TABLE>

The net periodic benefit cost attributable to U.S. retirement plans was $370
million in 2005, $329 million in 2004 and $309 million in 2003.
During 2003, the Company offered a voluntary retirement program with
enhanced benefits called the Retirement Enhancement Program (REP) to eligible
U.S. regular, full-time employees who have attained age 55 with at least 10
years of pension credited service by June 30, 2004. The program enhancements
included the elimination of the early retirement reduction for pension benefit
purposes (normally 4% per year prior to age 62) and a special termination
benefit (one week of pay per year of credited service). The program resulted in
a one-time increase in U.S. pension expense of $95 million in 2003 to reflect
the value of the retirement enhancement.
The weighted-average assumptions in the following table represent the rates
used to develop the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligation for
the year listed and also the net periodic benefit cost for the following year.

The Company's discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves
representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting
discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions is
determined using a building block approach, considering historical averages and
real returns of each asset class. In certain countries, where historical returns
are not meaningful, consideration is given to local market expectations of
long-term returns.

Strategic asset allocations are determined by country, based on the nature of
the liabilities and consideration of the demographic composition of the plan
participants (average age, years of service and active versus retiree status).
The Company's plans are considered non-mature plans and the long-term strategic
asset allocations are consistent with these types of plans. Emphasis is placed
on diversifying equities on a broad basis combined with currency matching of the
fixed income assets.

The Company is not required to fund its U.S. retirement plans in 2006 in order
to meet minimum statutory funding requirements. International plans will be
funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary
contributions will be made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term
obligations of the plans. In certain countries other than the U.S., the funding
of pension plans is not a common practice as funding provides no economic
benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans which are not
funded.
The following table displays the projected future minimum contributions to the
Company's U.S. and international unfunded retirement plans. These amounts do not

On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 was enacted that introduces a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare as well as a subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care
benefit plans. The Company's application to the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services attesting to the plan's "actuarial equivalence" to Medicare
has been accepted, and subsidy reimbursements are expected beginning in 2006.
There is no change in estimated participation rates or per capita claims costs
as a result of the Act. The Company has recognized the effect of the subsidy on
a prospective basis from June 28, 2004. The recognition reduces before-tax and
after-tax expense by $16 million and the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by $163 million.

15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company follows the provisions of SFAS 133 requiring that all derivative
instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
As of January 1, 2006, the balance of deferred net gains on derivatives
included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $15 million after-tax.
For additional information, see Note 12. The Company expects that substantially
all of this amount will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as
a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The
maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is
18 months. The amount ultimately realized in earnings will differ as foreign
exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by
actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative. Derivative gains/(losses),
initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income, are
reclassified to earnings in the period when the forecasted transaction affects
earnings.
For the years ended January 1, 2006, January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003,
the net impact of hedge ineffectiveness, transactions not qualifying for hedge
accounting and discontinuance of hedges, to the Company's financial statements
was insignificant.
Refer to Note 12 for disclosures of movements in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company invests its excess cash in both deposits with major banks
throughout the world and other high quality money market instruments. The
Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions
that have at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. On average, these
investments mature within six months, and the Company has not incurred any
related losses.
16. SAVINGS PLAN
The Company has voluntary 401(k) savings plans designed to enhance the existing
retirement programs covering eligible employees. The Company matches a
percentage of each employee's contributions consistent with the provisions of
the plan for which he/she is eligible.
In the U.S. salaried plan, through 2004, one-third of the Company match was
paid in Company stock under an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) unless the
employee chose to
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PAGE 55
<PAGE>
redirect his or her investment. In 1990, to establish the ESOP, the Company
loaned $100 million to the ESOP Trust to purchase shares of the Company stock on
the open market. In exchange, the Company received a note, the balance of which
was recorded as a reduction of shareholders' equity. The remaining shares held
by the ESOP trust were allocated to participant accounts by the end of February2005. From March 2005, and going forward, all company match will be made in cash
and will follow the individual employee's investment elections.
Total Company contributions to the plans were $148 million in 2005, $143
million in 2004 and $128 million in 2003.
17. MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
Certain businesses were acquired for $987 million in cash and $141 million of
liabilities assumed during 2005. These acquisitions were accounted for by the
purchase method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in
the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
The 2005 acquisitions included: TransForm Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a company
specializing in the discovery of superior formulations and novel crystalline
forms of drug molecules; Closure Medical Corporation, a company with expertise
and intellectual property in the biosurgicals market; Peninsula Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing
antibiotics to treat life-threatening infections; and rights to all consumer and
professionally dispensed REMBRANDT(R) Brand of oral care products, such as
whitening toothpastes, strips, systems and mouth rinses.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible
assets acquired amounted to $720 million and has been assigned to identifiable
intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Approximately $362
million has been identified as the value of in-process research and development
(IPR&D) primarily associated with the acquisitions of TransForm Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., Closure Medical Corporation and Peninsula Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
The IPR&D charge related to the acquisition of TransForm Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. was $50 million and is associated with research related to the discovery
and application of superior formulations. The value of the IPR&D was calculated
using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects.
The discount rate applied was 10%.
The IPR&D charge related to the acquisition of Closure Medical Corporation
was $51 million and is associated with the OMNEX(TM) Surgical Sealant in
vascular indications outside Europe and in other potential indications
worldwide. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections
discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. A probability of success
factor of 90% for vascular indications and 60% for all other indications was
used to reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate applied
to both vascular and other indications was 15%.
The IPR&D charge related to the acquisition of Peninsula Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. was $252 million and is associated with the development of doripenem, which
is in Phase III clinical trials. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using
cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. A
probability of success factor of 80% was used to reflect inherent clinical and
regulatory risk and the discount rate applied was 14%.
The remaining $9 million in IPR&D was associated with the acquisition of
international commercial rights to certain patents and know-how in the field of
sedation and analgesia from Scott Lab, Inc. The value of the IPR&D was
calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such
projects. The discount rate was 17%.
Certain businesses were acquired for $455 million in cash and $15 million
of liabilities assumed during 2004. These acquisitions were accounted for by the
purchase method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in
the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
In addition, per the terms of the 2003 acquisition agreement with the Link
Spine Group, Inc., $125 million in cash was paid to the owners of the Link Spine
Group, Inc. in 2004 based on the date the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved the CHARITE (TM) Artificial Disc. Thus, the 2004 total cash
expenditures related to acquisitions were $580 million.
The 2004 acquisitions included: Merck's 50% interest in the Johnson &
Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co. European non-prescription
pharmaceutical joint venture including all of the infrastructure and brand
assets managed by the European joint venture; Egea Biosciences, Inc. through the
exercise of the option to acquire the remaining outstanding stock not owned by
Johnson & Johnson, which has developed a proprietary technology platform called
Gene Writer, that allows for the rapid and highly accurate synthesis of DNA
sequences, gene assembly, and construction of large synthetic gene libraries;
Artemis Medical, Inc., a privately held company with ultrasound and x-ray
visible biopsy site breast markers as well as hybrid markers; U.S. commercial
rights to certain patents and know-how in the field of sedation and analgesia
from Scott Lab, Inc.; Biapharm SAS, a privately held French producer and
marketer of skin care products centered around the leading brand BIAFINE(R); the
assets of Micomed, a privately owned manufacturer of spinal implants primarily
focused on supplying the German market; and the acquisition of the AMBI(R) skin
care brand for women of color.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible
assets acquired amounted to $425 million and has been assigned to identifiable
intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. The $125 million
related to the U.S. FDA approval of the CHARITE (TM) Artificial Disc was
recorded as additional goodwill associated with the 2003 Link Spine Group, Inc.
acquisition. Thus, total additions to intangibles and goodwill in 2004 were $550
million. Approximately $18 million has been identified as the value of IPR&Dassociated with the Scott Lab, Inc. acquisition. The value of the IPR&D was
calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such
projects. The discount rate was 25%.
Certain businesses were acquired for $2.8 billion in cash and $323 million
of liabilities assumed during 2003. These acquisitions were accounted for by the
purchase method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in
the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
The 2003 acquisitions included: Link Spine Group, Inc., a privately owned
corporation with exclusive worldwide rights
PAGE 56 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2005 ANNUAL REPORT
<PAGE>
to the CHARITE(TM) Artificial Disc; Scios Inc., a biopharmaceutical company with
a marketed product for cardiovascular disease and research projects focused on
auto-immune diseases; 3-Dimensional Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a company with a
technology platform focused on the discovery and development of therapeutic
small molecules; OraPharma, Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on
the development and commercialization of unique oral therapeutics; and certain
assets of Orquest, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company focused on
developing biologically-based implants for orthopaedics and spine surgery.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible
assets acquired amounted to $1.8 billion and has been assigned to identifiable
intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Approximately $918
million has been identified as the value of IPR&D primarily associated with the
acquisition of Link Spine Group, Inc. and Scios Inc.
The IPR&D charge related to the Link Spine Group, Inc. acquisition was $170
million and is associated with the CHARITE(TM) Artificial Disc. The value of the
IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk
inherent in such projects. A probability of success factor of 95% was used to
reflect inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate was 19%. The
purchase price for the Link Spine Group, Inc. acquisition was allocated to the
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the
purchase price over the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired was
approximately $84 million and was allocated to goodwill. Substantially all of
the amount allocated to goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes.
The IPR&D charge related to Scios Inc. was $730 million and is largely
associated with its p-38 kinase inhibitor program. The value of the IPR&D was
calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such
projects using a 16% probability of success factor and a 9% discount rate. The
purchase price for the Scios Inc. acquisition was allocated to the tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their
estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Identifiable intangible assets
included patents and trademarks valued at approximately $1.5 billion. The excess
of the purchase price over the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired
was approximately $440 million and was allocated to goodwill. Substantially all
of the amount allocated to goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes.
The remaining IPR&D was associated with Orquest, Inc., and 3-Dimensional
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with charges of $11 million and $7 million, respectively.
Supplemental pro forma information for 2005, 2004 and 2003 per SFAS No.
141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did
not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or
financial position.
Divestitures in 2005, 2004 and 2003 did not have a material effect on the
Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
18. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
PRODUCT LIABILITY
The Company is involved in numerous product liability cases in the United
States, many of which concern adverse reactions to drugs and medical devices.
The damages claimed are substantial, and while the Company is confident of the
adequacy of the warnings and instructions for use that accompany such products,
it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. However, the
Company believes that if any liability results from such cases, it will be
substantially covered by existing amounts accrued in the Company's balance
sheet, and where available by third-party product liability insurance.
One group of cases against the Company concerns a product of the Company's
subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceutica Inc. (Janssen), PROPULSID(R) (cisapride),
which was withdrawn from general sale and restricted to limited use in 2000. In
the wake of publicity about those events, numerous lawsuits were filed against
Janssen and the Company regarding PROPULSID(R) in state and federal courts
across the country.
These actions seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and accuse
Janssen and the Company of inadequately testing for and warning about the drug's
side effects, of promoting it for off-label use and over promotion. In addition,
Janssen and the Company have entered into tolling agreements with various
plaintiffs' counsel halting the running of the statutes of limitations with
respect to the potential claims of a significant number of individuals whilethose attorneys evaluate whether or not to sue Janssen and the Company on their
behalf.
On February 5, 2004, Janssen announced that it had reached an agreement in
principle with the Plaintiffs Steering Committee (PSC) of the PROPULSID(R)
Federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL), to resolve federal lawsuits related to
PROPULSID(R). The agreement was to become effective once 85% of the death
claimants, and 75% of the remainder, agreed to the terms of the settlement. In
addition, 12,000 individuals who had not filed lawsuits, but whose claims were
the subject of tolling agreements suspending the running of the statutes of
limitations against those claims, also had to agree to participate in the
settlement before it became effective.
On March 24, 2005, it was confirmed that the PSC of the MDL had enrolled
enough plaintiffs and claimants in the settlement program to make the agreement
effective. Of the 282 death plaintiffs subject to the program, 267 (94%) are
confirmed enrolled. Of the 3,538 other plaintiffs subject to the program,
3,189 (90%) are confirmed enrolled. In addition, 19,865 "tolled" claimants are
confirmed as enrolled. Those participating in the settlement will submit medical
records to an independent panel of physicians who will determine whether the
claimed injuries were caused by PROPULSID(R) and otherwise meet the standards
for compensation. If those standards are met, a court-appointed special master
will determine compensatory damages. Janssen has paid into a compensation escrow
account $82.6 million, established an administrative fund of $15 million, and
paid legal fees to the PSC of $22.5 million, which amount was approved by the
court.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PAGE 57
<PAGE>
Not participating in the settlement program are 2,407 plaintiffs and 7,723
tolled claimants. Of those, 329 plaintiffs are potentially subject to the MDL
settlement but did not enroll in it; 1,529 plaintiffs filed cases in federal
court subsequent to February 1, 2004, and thus are not subject to the MDL
settlement; and 529 have state court actions and thus are not subject to the
settlement. Of those not participating in or subject to the MDL settlement, 133
plaintiffs are alleged to have died from use of the drug and 2,274 assert other
personal injury claims. The nature of the claims of the tolled claimants are
unknown. Of the remaining federal and state plaintiffs, 2,264 cases (94%) are
venued in Mississippi.
On December 15, 2005, Janssen reached agreement with the MDL PSC and the
plaintiffs' State Liaison Committee (SLC) to create a second settlement program
for resolving the remaining state and federal lawsuits filed before November 15,
2005, as well as remaining unfiled claims subject to tolling agreements. The new
program becomes effective once 90% of the plaintiffs representing decedents and
95% of the other plaintiffs agree to the terms of the settlement. The new
program allows enrollment by any claimant who was eligible for the prior
settlement program but chose not to enroll, plus state court plaintiffs and
federal court plaintiffs filing after February 1, 2004, and thus not eligible.
Janssen will pay as compensation a minimum of $14.5 million and a maximum of $15
million into the new settlement program, depending upon the percentage of
enrollment above the 90% and 95% thresholds. Janssen will also establish an
administrative fund not to exceed $3 million and pay legal fees not to exceed $4
million subject to court approval.
Janssen and the Company believe they have adequate self-insurance accruals
and third-party product liability insurance with respect to these cases. In
communications to the Company, the excess insurance carriers have raised certain
defenses to their liability under the policies and to date have declined
voluntarily to reimburse Janssen and the Company for PROPULSID(R)-related costs
despite demand for payment. In May 2005, hearings were held in London in the
arbitration proceeding commenced by Janssen and the Company against Allianz
Underwriters Insurance Company, which issued the first layer of applicable
excess insurance coverage, to obtain reimbursement of PROPULSID(R)-related
costs. That proceeding was resolved in a fashion satisfactory to Janssen and the
Company in November 2005. In May 2005, the Company commenced arbitration against
Lexington Insurance Company, which issued the second layer of excess insurance
coverage. In the opinion of the Company, the excess carriers remain legally
obligated to provide coverage for the PROPULSID(R)-related losses at issue.
AFFIRMATIVE STENT PATENT LITIGATION
In patent infringement actions tried in Delaware Federal District Court in late
2000, Cordis Corporation (Cordis), a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, obtained
verdicts of infringement and patent validity, and damage awards against Boston
Scientific Corporation (Boston Scientific) and Medtronic AVE, Inc. (Medtronic)
based on a number of Cordis vascular stent patents. On December 15, 2000, the
jury in the damage action against Boston Scientific returned a verdict of $324
million and on December 21, 2000, the jury in the Medtronic action returned a
verdict of $271 million. These sums represent lost profit and reasonable royalty
damages to compensate Cordis for infringement but do not include pre or post
judgment interest.
In March and May 2002, the district judge granted Boston Scientific a new
trial on liability and damages and vacated the verdict against Medtronic onlegal grounds. On August 12, 2003, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
found the trial judge erred in vacating the verdict against Medtronic and
remanded the case to the trial judge for further proceedings. In March 2005, the
remaining issues were tried in the remanded case against Medtronic and the
retrial proceeded against Boston Scientific. Juries returned verdicts of
infringement and patent validity in favor of Cordis in both retrials. Cordis has
requested the trial court to reinstate with interest the verdicts obtained
against those entities in 2000. Defendants in both cases have filed post-trial
motions seeking to vacate the jury verdicts or, alternatively, grant them a new
trial on damages. Cordis also has pending in Delaware Federal District Court a
second action against Medtronic AVE accusing Medtronic of infringement by sale
of stent products introduced by Medtronic subsequent to its GFX(R) and
MicroStent(R) products, the subject of the earlier action referenced above. That
second action was stayed in April 2005 pending the outcome of an arbitration
held in late 2005 concerning Medtronic's claim that the products at issue in
that case are licensed pursuant to a 1997 license.
In January 2003, Cordis filed a patent infringement action against Boston
Scientific in Delaware Federal District Court accusing its Express2(TM),Taxus(R)
and Liberte stents of infringing the Palmaz patent that expired in November
2005. The Liberte stent was also accused of infringing Cordis' Gray patent that
expires in 2016. In June 2005, a jury found that the Express2(TM), Taxus(R) and
Liberte stents infringed the Palmaz patent and that the Liberte stent also
infringed the Gray patent. Boston Scientific has filed post-trial motions
seeking to vacate the verdict or obtain a new trial. If those motions are
denied, there will be a trial on damages and willfulness in the future.

<PAGE>
PATENT LITIGATION AGAINST VARIOUS
JOHNSON & JOHNSON SUBSIDIARIES
The products of various Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries are the subject of
various patent lawsuits, the outcomes of which could potentially adversely
affect the ability of those subsidiaries to sell those products, or require the
payment of past damages and future royalties. With respect to all of these
matters, the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary involved is vigorously defending
against the claims of infringement and disputing, where appropriate, the
validity and enforceability of the patent claims asserted against it. On July 1,
2005, a jury in Federal District Court in Delaware found that the Cordis
CYPHER(R) stent infringed Boston Scientific's Ding `536 patent and that the
Cordis CYPHER(R) and BX VELOCITY(R) stents also infringed Boston Scientific
Corporation's Jang `021 patent. The jury also found both those patents valid.
Cordis has asked the judge to overturn the jury verdicts or grant a new trial.
If the judge does not overturn the jury verdicts, there will be a damage and
willfulness trial in 2006 and Boston Scientific will seek an injunction against
CYPHER(R). If upheld by the trial court, Cordis will appeal the jury verdicts to
the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
In March 2006, Boston Scientific's case asserting infringement by the
CYPHER(R) stent of another Boston Scientific patent is scheduled for trial in
Delaware Federal District Court. In that case as well, Boston Scientific seeks
an injunction and substantial damages.
On January 26, 2005, the Federal District Court for the Southern District
of Florida granted Cordis summary judgment dismissing a breach of contract and
patent infringement suit filed against Cordis by Arlaine and Gina Rockey seeking
royalties on the sales of all Cordis balloon expandable stents. Plaintiffs
have filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
In an action filed in Belgium by Boston Scientific under its Kastenhofer
patent, Boston Scientific is seeking a pan-European injunction against the sale
of infringing catheters, i.e., an injunction that would be effective not just in
Belgium but in all of the countries served by the European Patent Office. Trial
has not been scheduled but could occur during 2006.
The following chart summarizes various patent lawsuits concerning products
of Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries.

LITIGATION AGAINST FILERS OF ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG
APPLICATIONS (ANDAS)
The following chart indicates lawsuits pending against generic firms that filed
Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking to market generic forms of products
sold by various subsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the
applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include
allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of these
patents. In the event the subsidiary of the Company involved is not successful
in these actions, or the 30-month stay expires before a ruling from the district
court is obtained, the firms involved will have the ability to introduce generic
versions of the product at issue resulting in very substantial market share and
revenue losses for the product of the Company's subsidiary.
As previously communicated and noted from the following chart, 30-month
stays are scheduled to expire during 2006 with respect to ANDA challenges
regarding ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN(R) LO, RISPERDAL(R) and TOPAMAX(R). Trial did not
occur before the expiration of the stays with respect to ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN(R) LO,
is unlikely to occur with respect to RISPERDAL(R), but could occur in the case
of TOPAMAX(R). Unless 30-month stays are extended or preliminary injunctions
granted, outcomes which are uncertain, final FDA approval to market will occur
shortly after expiration of the 30-month stays. Because a firm that launches an
ANDA product before trial would be liable potentially for lost profits if found
at trial to infringe a valid patent, typically ANDA products are not launched
under such circumstances. Nonetheless, such "at risk" launches have occurred in
cases involving drugs of Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries, and the risk of such a
launch cannot be ruled out.

In the action against Mylan Pharmaceuticals USA (Mylan) involving the Company's
subsidiary Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc.'s (Ortho-McNeil) product, DITROPAN
XL(R) (oxybutynin chloride), the court on September 27, 2005, found the DITROPAN
XL(R) patent invalid and not infringed by Mylan's ANDA product. Ortho-McNeil and
ALZA Corporation (ALZA), a subsidiary of the Company, have appealed. In the
action against Impax, Impax also received judgment of invalidity based on the
decision in the Mylan suit and Ortho-McNeil and ALZA have appealed that
decision. Both appeals have been consolidated. Neither Mylan nor Impax has
received final FDA approval to launch its ANDA product, but such approval could
come at any point.
PAGE 60 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2005 ANNUAL REPORT
<PAGE>
On December 20, 2005, Mylan announced that it had entered into two
agreements with Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc. regarding oxybutynin chloride
extended release tablets. One agreement relates to Ortho-McNeil's supply of
certain dosages of oxybutynin chloride extended release tablets and the second
relates to a patent license to ALZA intellectual property regarding DITROPAN
XL(R). The terms of the agreements, which are confidential, depend on the
outcome of the appeal of the West Virginia court's decision and are subject to
review by the Federal Trade Commission.
In the weeks following the adverse ruling in the DITROPAN XL(R) ANDA
litigation against Mylan in September 2005, Ortho-McNeil and ALZA received five
antitrust class action complaints filed by indirect purchasers of the product.
The complaints were filed in various federal courts, but all claim damages based
on the laws of over 25 states. They allege that Ortho-McNeil and ALZA violated
the antitrust laws of the various states by knowingly pursuing baseless patent
litigation, and thereby delaying entry in the market by Mylan and Impax.
In the action against Mylan involving Ortho-McNeil for LEVAQUIN(R)
(levofloxacin), the trial judge on December 23, 2004 found the patent at issue
valid, enforceable and infringed by Mylan's ANDA product and issued an
injunction precluding sale of the product until patent expiration in late 2010.
On December 19, 2005, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, affirmed the
judgment of validity, enforceability and infringement. Mylan has filed a motion
for rehearing by the Court of Appeals.
In the consolidated actions against Teva, Sicor, Hi-Tech Pharmacal, and
American Pharmaceutical Partners involving the ANDAs for various Levofloxacin
preparations, a trial is tentatively scheduled to begin in April 2006 on the
claim that the Levaquin patent was obtained by inequitable conduct and is
therefore unenforceable.
In the action against Kali involving Ortho-McNeil's ULTRACET(R) (tramadol
hydrochloride/acetaminophen), Kali moved for summary judgment on the issues of
infringement and invalidity. The briefing on that motion was completed in
October 2004 and a decision is expected anytime. With respect to claims other
than that at issue in the litigation against Kali, Ortho-McNeil has filed a
reissue application in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking to narrow
the scope of the claims. Notice of allowance of that patent was received on
October 21, 2005. Kali obtained final approval of its ANDA at expiration of the
30-month stay on April 21, 2005, and launched its generic product the same day.
If Ortho-McNeil ultimately prevails in its patent infringement action against
Kali, Kali will be subject to an injunction and damages.
In the action against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA (Teva) involvingOrtho-McNeil's ULTRACET(R) (tramadol hydrocholoride/acetaminophen), Teva has
moved for summary judgment on the issues of infringement and validity. The
briefing on that motion was completed in March 2005. A ruling could issue at any
point.
In the action against Caraco involving Ortho-McNeil's ULTRACET(R) (tramadol
hydrocholoride/acetaminophen), Caraco's motion for summary judgment of
non-infringement was granted on October 20, 2005. Ortho-McNeil has appealed that
decision. Caraco launched its generic ULTRACET(R) "at risk" in December 2005.
With respect to all of the above matters, the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary
involved is vigorously defending the validity and enforceability and asserting
the infringement of its own or its licensor's patents.
AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICE (AWP) LITIGATION
Johnson & Johnson and its pharmaceutical subsidiaries, along with numerous other
pharmaceutical companies, are defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and
federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain
pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct
because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated
Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Most of these cases, both
federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, have been
consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) in
federal district court in Boston, Massachusetts. The plaintiffs in these cases
include classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the
purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that
made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. In the MDL
proceeding in Boston, plaintiffs moved for class certification of all or some
portion of their claims. On August 16, 2005, the trial judge certified
Massachusetts only classes of private insurers providing "Medi-gap" insurance
coverage and private payers for physician-administered drugs where payments were
based on AWP. The judge also allowed plaintiffs to file a new complaint seeking
to name proper parties to represent a national class of individuals who made
co-payments for physician-administered drugs covered by Medicare. The Court of
Appeals declined to allow an appeal of those issues and on January 19, 2006, at
a hearing on class certification issues, the court indicated its intent to
certify the national class as noted above.
OTHER
The New York State Attorney General's office (N.Y. AG) and the Federal Trade
Commission issued subpoenas in January and February 2003 seeking documents
relating to the marketing of sutures and endoscopic instruments by the Company's
Ethicon and Ethicon Endo-Surgery subsidiaries. In February 2005, the N.Y. AG
advised that it had closed its investigation. The Connecticut State Attorney
General's office also issued a subpoena for the same documents. These subpoenas
focus on the bundling of sutures and endoscopic instruments in contracts offered
to group purchasing organizations and individual hospitals in which discounts
are predicated on the hospital achieving specified market share targets for both
categories of products. The operating companies involved have responded to the
subpoenas.
In June 2003, the Company received a request for records and information
from the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Energy and Commerce in
connection with its investigation into pharmaceutical reimbursements and rebates
under Medicaid. The Committee's request focuses on the drug REMICADE(R)
(infliximab), marketed by the Company's Centocor, Inc. (Centocor) subsidiary. In
July 2003, Centocor received a
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PAGE 61
<PAGE>
request that it voluntarily provide documents and information to the criminal
division of the U.S. Attorney's Office, District of New Jersey, in connection
with its investigation into various Centocor marketing practices. Subsequent
requests for documents have been received from the U.S. Attorney's Office. Both
the Company and Centocor responded, or are in the process of responding, to
these requests for documents and information.
In August 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) advised the
Company of its informal investigation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
allegations of payments to Polish governmental officials by U.S. pharmaceutical
companies. In November 2003, the SEC advised the Company that the investigation
had become formal and issued a subpoena for the information previously requested
in an informal fashion, in addition to other background documents. The Company
and its operating units in Poland have responded to these requests.
In December 2003, Ortho-McNeil received a subpoena from the United States
Attorney's Office in Boston, Massachusetts seeking documents relating to the
marketing, including alleged off-label marketing, of the drug TOPAMAX(R)
(topiramate). Ortho-McNeil is cooperating in responding to the subpoena. In
October 2004, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston asked attorneys for
Ortho-McNeil to cooperate in facilitating the subpoenaed testimony of several
present and former Ortho-McNeil employees before a grand jury in Boston.
Cooperation in securing the testimony of additional witnesses before the grandjury has been requested and is being provided.
In January 2004, Janssen received a subpoena from the Office of the
Inspector General of the United States Office of Personnel Management seeking
documents concerning sales and marketing of, any and all payments to physicians
in connection with sales and marketing of, and clinical trials for, RISPERDAL(R)
(risperidone) from 1997 to 2002. Documents subsequent to 2002 have also been
requested. An additional subpoena seeking information about marketing of and
adverse reactions to RISPERDAL(R) was received from the United States Attorney's
Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in November 2005. Janssen is
cooperating in responding to these subpoenas.
In April 2004, the Company's pharmaceutical companies were requested to
submit information to the U.S. Senate Finance Committee on their use of the
"nominal pricing exception" in calculating Best Price under the Medicaid Rebate
Program. This request was sent to manufacturers for the top twenty drugs
reimbursed under the Medicaid Program. The Company's pharmaceutical companies
have responded to the request. In February 2005 a request for supplemental
information was received from the Senate Finance Committee, which has been
responded to by the Company's pharmaceutical companies.
In July 2004, the Company received a letter request from the New York State
Attorney General's Office for documents pertaining to marketing, off-label sales
and clinical trials for TOPAMAX(R) (topiramate), RISPERDAL(R) (risperidone),
PROCRIT(R) (Epoetin alfa), RAZADYNE(TM) (galantamine HBr), REMICADE(R)
(infliximab) and ACIPHEX(R) (rabeprazole sodium). The Company has responded to
the request.
In August 2004, Johnson & Johnson Health Care Systems, Inc. (HCS), a

Committee for additional information in January 2006. The Company is in the
process of responding to the most recent request.
In July 2005, Scios Inc. (Scios), a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary, received
a subpoena from the United States Attorney's Office, District of Massachusetts,
seeking documents related to the sales and marketing of NATRECOR(R). Scios is
responding to the subpoena. In early August 2005, Scios was advised that the
investigation will be handled by the United States Attorney's Office for the

In September 2005, Johnson & Johnson received a subpoena from the United
States Attorney's Office, District of Massachusetts, seeking documents related

moved to certify a class of all African American and Hispanic salaried employees
of the Company and its affiliates in the U.S., who were employed at any time
from November 1997 to the present. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages for the
period 1997 through the present (including punitive damages) and equitable
relief. The Company filed its response to plaintiffs' class certification motion
in
PAGE 62 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2005 ANNUAL REPORT
<PAGE>
May 2005. The Company disputes the allegations in the lawsuit and is vigorously
defending against them.
The Company, along with its wholly owned Ethicon and Ethicon Endo-Surgery
subsidiaries, are defendants in three federal antitrust actions challenging
suture and endo-mechanical contracts with group purchasing organizations andhospitals in which discounts are predicated on a hospital achieving specified
market share targets for both categories of products. In each case, plaintiffs
seek substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief. These actions are:
Applied Medical v. Ethicon Inc. et al. (C.D.CA, filed September 5, 2003); Conmed
v. Johnson & Johnson et al. (S.D.N.Y., filed November 6, 2003); and Genico v.
Ethicon, Inc. et al. (E.D. TX, filed October 15, 2004). In December 2005, two
purported class actions were filed on behalf of purchasers of endo-mechanical
instruments. These actions, captioned Delaware Valley Surgical Supply Co., Inc.
v. Johnson & Johnson et al. and Niagara Falls Memorial Medical Center v. Johnson
& Johnson et al., were both filed in the federal district court for the Central
District of California.
After a remand from the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in January 2003, a
partial retrial was commenced in October and concluded in November 2003 in
Federal District Court in Boston, Massachusetts in the action Amgen, Inc.
(Amgen) v. Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. (TKT) and Aventis Pharmaceutical, Inc.
(Aventis). The matter is a patent infringement action brought by Amgen against
TKT, the developer of a gene-activated EPO product, and Aventis, which held
marketing rights to the TKT product, asserting that TKT's product infringes
various Amgen patent claims. TKT and Aventis dispute infringement and are
seeking to invalidate the Amgen patents asserted against them. On October 15,
2004, the district court issued rulings that upheld its initial findings in 2001
that Amgen's patent claims were valid and infringed. An appeal to the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit was argued on December 7, 2005. The Amgen
patents at issue in the case are exclusively licensed to Ortho Biotech in the
U.S. for non-dialysis indications. Ortho Biotech is not a party to the action.
In November 2005, Amgen filed suit against Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc. in the
United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a
declaration that the Roche product CERA, which Roche has indicated it will seek
to introduce into the United States, infringes a number of Amgen patents
concerning EPO. The suit is in its preliminary stages.
The Company is also involved in a number of other patent, trademark and
other lawsuits incidental to its business. The ultimate legal and financial
liability of the Company in respect to all claims, lawsuits and proceedings
referred to above cannot be estimated with any certainty. However, in the
Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to
date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings,
net of liabilities already accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position,
although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters
could have a significant impact on the Company's results of operations and cash
flows for that period.
19. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net
earnings per share for the years ended January 1, 2006, January 2, 2005 and
December 28, 2003:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
(Shares in Millions) 2005 2004 2003
- --------------------------------------------------------------
<S> <C> <C> <C>
Basic net earnings per share $ 3.50 2.87 2.42
Average shares
outstanding-basic 2,973.9 2,968.4 2,968.1
Potential shares exercisable
under stock option plans 203.1 186.5 166.6
Less: shares repurchased
under treasury stock method (168.9) (163.8) (141.4)
Convertible debt shares 4.4 12.4 14.8
-----------------------------
Adjusted average shares
outstanding-diluted 3,012.5 3,003.5 3,008.1
Diluted net earnings per share $ 3.46 2.84 2.40
=============================
</TABLE>
The diluted net earnings per share calculation includes the dilutive effect of
convertible debt: a decrease in interest expense of $11 million, $14 million and
$15 million after tax for years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Diluted net earnings per share excludes 45 million, 42 million and 47
million shares underlying stock options for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
as the exercise price of these options was greater than their average market
value, which would result in an anti-dilutive effect on diluted earnings per
share.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Under Section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to
assess the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that
assessment, whether the Company's internal control over financial reporting is
effective.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as
to the reliability of the Company's financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.
Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed,
have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements.
Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
The Company's management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2006. In making this
assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in "Internal
Control-Integrated Framework." These criteria are in the areas of control
environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication,
and monitoring. The Company's assessment included extensive documenting,
evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal
controls over financial reporting.
Based on the Company's processes and assessment, as described above,
management has concluded that, as of January 1, 2006, the Company's internal
control over financial reporting was effective.
Management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2006 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which appears herein.
PAGE 64 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2005 ANNUAL REPORT
<PAGE>
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Johnson & Johnson:
We have completed integrated audits of Johnson & Johnson's consolidated
financial statements as of and for the years ended January 1, 2006 and January
2, 2005, and of its internal control over financial reporting as of January 1,2006, and an audit of its consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 28, 2003, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits,
are presented below.
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, statements of equity and statements of cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Johnson & Johnson and Subsidiaries (the "Company") at January 1, 2006 and
January 2, 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended January 1, 2006 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Also, in our opinion, management's assessment included in the accompanying,
"Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting," that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
January 1, 2006 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those
criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 1,
2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management's assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial
reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

<FONT size="2">Forward-looking statements are based on current
expectations of future events. The Company cannot guarantee that
any forward-looking statement will be accurate, although the
Company believes that it has been reasonable in its expectations
and assumptions. Investors should realize that if underlying
assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties
materialize, actual results could vary materially from the
Company&#146;s expectations and projections. Investors are
therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any
forward-looking statements. Furthermore, the Company assumes no

damages and future royalties. In particular, generic drug firms
have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking to market
generic forms of most of the Company&#146;s key pharmaceutical
products, prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering
those products. In the event that the Company is not successful
in defending the resulting lawsuits, generic versions of the

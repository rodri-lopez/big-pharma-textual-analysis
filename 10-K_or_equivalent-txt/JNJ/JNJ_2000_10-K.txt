1REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Pension and Benefits Committees of Johnson & Johnson
In our opinion, the accompanying statements of net assets available for benefits and the related statements of changes in net assets available for
benefits present fairly, in all material respects, the net assets available for benefits of the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan (the "Plan") as of
December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the changes in net assets available for benefits for the years then ended in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan's management; our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The supplemental
schedule of assets held for investment purposes and schedule of reportable transactions are presented for the purpose of additional analysis and
are not a required part of the basic financial statements but are supplementary information required by the Department of Labor's Rules and
Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. These supplemental schedules are the
responsibility of the Plan's management. The fund information in the statements of net assets available for benefits and the statements of
changes in net assets available for benefits is presented for the purposes of additional analysis rather than to present the net assets available for
benefits and changes in net assets available for benefits of each fund. The supplemental schedules and fund information have been subjected to
the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

6JOHNSON & JOHNSON SAVINGS PLAN
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Organization:
The Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan (the "Plan") is a defined contribution plan which was established on June 1, 1982 for eligible salaried and
non-union hourly employees of Johnson & Johnson ("J&J" or the "Company") and certain domestic subsidiaries. The Plan was designed to
enhance the existing retirement program of eligible employees. The funding of the Plan is made through employee and Company contributions.
The assets of the Plan are maintained in two Master Trust accounts ("Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan Trust" and "Johnson & Johnson Pension
Trust Fund") and transactions therein are executed by the trustee, Bankers Trust Company. The Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan Trust and the
Johnson & Johnson Pension Trust Fund are allocated based upon the total of each individual participant's share of the Johnson & Johnson
Savings Plan Trust and the Johnson & Johnson Pension Trust Fund.
Effective January 1, 1991, the Company implemented a Leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") to supplement its existing 401
(k) plan. The ESOP is a leveraged employee stock ownership plan and is designed to comply with Section 4975(e)(7) and the regulations
thereunder of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and is subject to the applicable provisions of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended. The ESOP is used to fund an additional 25% match of employee contributions ("ESOP contribution").
Additionally, the Company may elect to fund the employer 50% match of employee directed contributions with ESOP leveraged shares.
Initial funding for the ESOP was made through an advance from Johnson & Johnson of $100 million, which was used to purchase 1,554,800
shares of J&J common stock on the open market (which equates to 6,219,200 shares when adjusted for subsequent stock splits). Of these
shares, 2,206,210 (adjusted for stock splits) remain unallocated as of December 31, 1999. These shares are allocated to Plan participants under
a formula set forth in the note agreement relating to the advance from J&J. Accordingly, the financial statements of the Plan for the years 1999
and 1998 present separately the assets and liabilities and changes therein pertaining to:
(a) the accounts of employees with vested rights in allocated stock (Allocated) and
(b) stock not yet allocated to employees (Unallocated).
Each participant is entitled to exercise voting rights attributable to the shares allocated to their account. The Company is entitled to exercise
voting rights attributable to unallocated shares.
7JOHNSON & JOHNSON SAVINGS PLAN
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued
1. Organization (Continued):
In the third quarter of 1998, Johnson & Johnson incorporated a "dividend pass-through" feature into the Plan. This feature allows a participant
to receive cash for dividends paid on certain shares owned through the plan. To receive a dividend pass-through, it is contingent on the
ownership of shares in the Johnson & Johnson Stock Fund and it does not apply to any share owned in Employee Stock Ownership Plan Trust
Fund. In order to receive dividend pass-through amounts, participant eligibility is based on the lesser of (a) 20% of the eligible compensation
(annual base pay rate for the year plus 50% of prior calendar year commissions) and (b) IRS Pre-tax compensation limit ($10,000 in 1999)
reduced by the estimated pre-tax contribution for the year (current pre-tax percentage multiplied by the eligible compensation for the year). For
the 1999 and 1998 plan years, the dividend pass-through amounts recorded in the Plan statement of changes in net assets available for benefits
as dividend income and payments to participants were $8,407,284 and $4,259,619 respectively.
On October 1, 1999, the assets of the Innotech 401(k) Retirement Plan were transferred into the Plan. On October 1, 1998 and December 1,
1998, the assets of the Clinical Diagnostics 401(k) Retirement Plan were transferred into the Plan; and on July 1, 1998, the assets of the
UltraCision 401(k) Retirement Plan were transferred into the Plan.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
Valuation of Investments:
Equity investments in the Johnson & Johnson Stock Fund and the ESOP, administered by Bankers Trust Company, are valued at the average of
the high and low market price on the last business day of the year. The cost of equity investments in the Johnson & Johnson Stock Fund are
recorded at the average market price of the stock transactions for the month during which the contribution is made.
The investments in the US Government Securities (the "USGS Fund"), Fixed Interest, and Diversified Equity funds represent the Plan's share
of assets in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan Trust ("Savings Plan Trust"). The USGS Fund consists of short-term obligations that are
issued or guaranteed by the US Government. Investments are valued at cost which approximates market value. Deposits in group annuity
contracts in the Fixed Interest Fund are recorded at their contract values which approximates fair value because these investments have fully
benefit-responsive features. Contract value represents contributions and reinvested income, less any withdrawals plus accrued interest.
Participants may direct the withdrawal or transfer of all or a portion of their investment at contract value. However, withdrawals influenced by
employer initiated events such as in connection with the sale of a business, may result in a distribution at other than contract value. There are
no reserves against contract values for credit risk of contract issuers or otherwise.
8JOHNSON & JOHNSON SAVINGS PLAN
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued):
The average yield of the Fixed Interest Fund was approximately 6.56% for 1999 and 6.71% for 1998. The crediting interest rate of the Fixed
Interest Fund was approximately 6.63% for 1999 and 6.77% for 1998. The difference between the average yield and crediting interest rate is
due to administrative charges paid by the Plan. The crediting interest rate for the investment contracts is either agreed-to in advance with the
issuer or varies based on an agreed-to formula, but cannot be less than zero.
Equity investments and corporate obligations in the Diversified Equity Fund, managed by Capital Guardian Trust Company and J.P. Morgan
Investment Management, Inc., are traded on a national securities exchange and are valued at the last reported market sales price on the last
business day of the year. Investments in the Diversified Equity Fund are purchased periodically by Capital Guardian Trust Company and J.P.
Morgan Investment Management, Inc. based on the prevailing market values of the underlying investments.
The Intermediate Bond Fund invests in various kinds of bonds, primarily corporate and U.S. government bonds. The Balanced Fund is invested
in a mix of stocks, bonds, and real estate. The investment in these funds represents the Plan's share of the assets in the Johnson & Johnson
Pension Trust Fund ("Pension Trust Fund"). These investments are stated at fair value. Generally, they represent securities traded on a national
securities exchange which are valued at the last reported sales price on the last business day of the year.
In the first quarter of 1999, the Company incorporated an additional fund to the Plan, the International Equity Fund. The International Equity
Fund, managed by American Express Management and Capital Guardian Trust Company, invests primarily in equities sold on foreign
exchange markets. These investments are valued at the last reported market sales price on the last business day of the year. The investment in
the fund represents the Plan's share of the assets in the Pension Trust Fund.
Participant loans are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
Temporary cash investments are stated at redemption value which approximates fair value.
Transfers:
Transfers among funds, which are made at the participant's election, have been presented as assets transferred in the Statement of Changes in
Net Assets Available for Benefits. With respect to the ESOP, transfers represent shares allocated to the participants.
9JOHNSON & JOHNSON SAVINGS PLAN
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued):
Use of Estimates:
The preparation of the Plan's financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the
plan administrator to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of net assets available for benefits at the date of the
financial statements and the changes in net assets available for benefits during the reporting period and, when applicable, disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Risks and Uncertainties:
The Plan provides for various participant investment options in funds which can invest in any combination of stocks, bonds, fixed income
securities, mutual funds, and other investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market and
credit. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of
investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in risks in the near term would materially affect participants' account
balances and the amounts reported in the statements of net assets available for benefits and the statements of changes in net assets available for
benefits.
Other:
Interest and dividend income is recorded as earned on the accrual basis. Purchases and sales of investment securities are reflected on a trade-
date basis. Gains and losses on sales of investment securities are determined on the average cost method. Administrative charges are allocated
monthly bases on the quarterly percentage of assets in each of the six investment funds.
All third party administrative expenses are paid by the Plan, except cost of entering new investment vehicles which are paid primarily by
Johnson & Johnson.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued
3. Contributions:
Participating employees may contribute a minimum of 3% up to a maximum of 20% of their base salary plus 50 percent of eligible
commissions in combinations of pre- and post-tax contributions. Pre-tax contributions may not exceed the smaller of 20% of their base salary
including 50 percent of eligible commissions or $10,000 in 1999 and 16% of their base salary including 50 percent of eligible commissions or
$10,000 in 1998. The Company contributes to the Plan an amount equal to 75% of the employee directed contributions of the participants up to
a maximum of 6% of the employee's base salary and 50 percent of eligible commissions.
Contributions are made to the Plan by participants through payroll deductions and by the Company on behalf of participants. Such
contributions, with the exception of the ESOP contribution, are invested in any of the seven investment funds at the direction of the
participating employees. The 25% ESOP contribution is invested in J&J stock, except for employees over 55 years of age who may choose the
alternative investments. ESOP shares are released from the unallocated portion of the ESOP each February following the payment of the loan
(see Note 9), in accordance with the ESOP Trust Agreement. Shares released, in accordance with the ESOP note agreement, may be more or
less than shares earned by participants. In the accompanying statements of net assets available for benefits, shares earned by participants in
excess of those allocated have been reflected in the accompanying financial statements as assets designated for transfer.
The number of participants invested in each fund at December 31, 1999 and 1998 was:
1999 1998
--------- ---------
U.S. Government Securities Fund 3,066 3,063

Participants may elect to invest in more than one fund and can change investment direction once every three months. A total of 38,162 and
36,704 active and former employees had investments in the Plan for 1999 and 1998, respectively.

4. Participant Accounts and Benefits:
All participants are fully vested in their contributions and the Company match. The benefit to which a Plan participant is entitled is the amount
provided by contributions (Company and participant) and investment earnings thereon (including net realized and unrealized investment gains
and losses) which have been allocated to such participant's account balance. Allocations are based on participant earnings on account balance,
as defined.
Participants are allowed to withdraw their after-tax contributions and earnings thereon, at any time. Participants may withdraw before-tax
contributions only upon meeting certain hardship conditions.
5. Loans to Participants:
Participants may borrow up to a maximum of 50% of their account balance or $50,000, whichever is less. Loans bear a market rate of interest
plus 1% and are repayable within five years. Loans are secured by the balance in the participant accounts.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued
7. Tax Status:
The Internal Revenue Service has determined and informed the Company by a letter dated April 25, 1996, that the Plan and related trust are
designed in accordance with applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The Plan has been amended since receiving the
determination letter. However, the Plan administrator believes that the Plan is designed and is currently being operated in compliance with
applicable requirements of the IRC.
8. Termination Priorities:
The Company has the right to terminate the Plan at any time, and in the event the Plan is terminated, subject to conditions set forth in ERISA,
the amount of each participant's account balance in the Plan is fully vested.
9. Indebtedness
In connection with the formation of the Plan's ESOP feature, the Plan borrowed $100 million from Johnson & Johnson for the purpose of
purchasing J&J common stock. The note bears interest at 9% and is payable through February 15, 2005. The Company is obligated to make
contributions in cash to the ESOP which, when aggregated with the ESOP's dividends and interest earnings, equal the amount necessary to
enable the ESOP to make its regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest due on the term loan.
Aggregate maturities for the next five years are as follows:
2000 $ 7,289,791
2001 7,664,462
2002 8,082,746
2003 8,548,156
2004 9,064,538
Thereafter 5,919,055
-----------
$46,568,748
In the event of Plan termination or of termination of the ESOP portion of the Plan, any unallocated shares shall be sold to the Company or on
the open market. The proceeds of such sale shall be used to satisfy the outstanding principal and interest. The Company has no rights against
shares once they are allocated under the ESOP.
10. Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Plan to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of the Fixed Interest Fund holdings
in fully benefit-responsive group annuity contracts with insurance and other financial institutions.
17JOHNSON & JOHNSON SAVINGS PLAN
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued
10. Concentrations of Credit Risk, (Continued):
The Fixed Interest Fund places its fully benefit-responsive group annuity contracts with high-credit quality institutions and, by policy, limits
the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution. If any of the insurance companies that the group annuity contracts are invested
with fail to perform according to the contract, the asset value of the Plan could be impaired.

1REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Pension and Benefits Committees of Johnson & Johnson
In our opinion, the accompanying statements of net assets available for benefits and the related statements of changes in net assets available for
benefits present fairly, in all material respects, the net assets available for benefits of the Johnson & Johnson Retirement Savings Plan (the
"Plan") as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the changes in net assets available for benefits for the years then ended in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above.
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The supplemental
schedule of assets held for investment purposes and schedule of reportable transactions are presented for the purpose of additional analysis and
are not a required part of the basic financial statements but are supplementary information required by the Department of Labor's Rules and
Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. These supplemental schedules are the
responsibility of the Plan's management. The fund information in the statements of net assets available for benefits and the statement of
changes in net assets available for benefits is presented for the purposes of additional analysis rather than to present the net assets available for
benefits and changes in net assets available for benefits of each fund. The supplemental schedules and fund information have been subjected to
the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

4JOHNSON & JOHNSON RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Organization:
The Johnson & Johnson Retirement Savings Plan (the "Plan") is a defined contribution plan which was established on March 1, 1990 for
eligible employees of certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson ("J&J" or the "Company") located in Puerto Rico which have adopted the
Plan. The Plan was designed to provide eligible employees with an opportunity to strengthen their financial security at retirement by providing
an incentive to save and invest regularly. The funding of the Plan is made through employee and Company contributions. The assets of the Plan
are maintained and transactions therein are executed by the trustee, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
Valuation of Investments:
Equity investments in the Johnson & Johnson Stock Fund, administered by Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, are valued at the closing market
price on the last business day of the year. Equity investments in the Equity Fund, managed by the Capital Research and Management Company,
represent shares of a registered investment company and are valued at quoted market price which represents the net asset value of shares held
by the Plan at year-end.
The cost of equity investments in the Johnson & Johnson Stock Fund is recorded at the average market price of the stock transactions for the
month during which the contribution is made. Units in the Equity Fund are purchased throughout the month at the prevailing quoted market
price on those dates.
Deposits in short-term investments in the Short-Term Investment Fund are principally purchases of shares of the Prime Portfolio of Vanguard
Money Market Reserves, Inc. The Portfolio invests in securities which mature in less than one year. The value of this portfolio is the market
value on the last business day of the year.
Temporary cash investments are stated at redemption value which approximates fair value.
Transfers:
Transfers among funds, which are made at the participant's election, have been presented as assets transferred in the Statement of Changes in
Net Assets Available for Benefits.
5JOHNSON & JOHNSON RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued):
Use of Estimates:
The preparation of the Plan's financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the
plan administrator to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of net assets available for benefits at the date of the
financial statements and the changes in net assets available for benefits during the reporting period and, when applicable, disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Risks and Uncertainties:
The Plan provides for various participant investment options in funds which can invest in any combination of stocks, bonds, fixed income
securities, mutual funds, and other investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market and
credit. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of
investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in risks in the near term would materially affect participants' account
balances and the amounts reported in the statements of net assets available for benefits and the statements of changes in net assets available for
benefits.
Other:
Interest and dividend income are recorded as earned on the accrual basis. Purchases and sales of investment securities are reflected on a trade-
date basis. Gains and losses on sales of investment securities are determined on the average cost method.
All third party administrative expenses are paid by the Plan, except costs of entering new investment vehicles which are paid primarily by
Johnson & Johnson.
3. Contributions:
Participating employees may contribute a minimum of 3% up to a maximum of 10% pre-tax and/or 1% to 10% post-tax of their base salary.
Annual pre-tax contributions may not exceed $8,000 in 1999 or 1998 under Puerto Rico law. The Company contributes to the Plan, out of
current or accumulated profits, an amount equal to 66-2/3% of the employee's pre-tax contributions for the Plan year.
Contributions are made to the Plan by participants through payroll deductions and by the Company on behalf of participants. Employee
contributions are to be invested in any of the three investment funds at the direction of the participating employees. All Company contributions
are made to the J&J Stock Fund, except for participants over the age of 50, who may choose the alternative investments.
6JOHNSON & JOHNSON RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued
3. Contributions (Continued):
The number of participants invested in each fund at December 31, 1999 and 1998 was:
1999 1998
---- ----
Johnson & Johnson Stock Fund 3,206 3,295
Equity Fund 1,024 1,115
Short-Term Investments Fund 1,117 1,285
Participants may elect to invest in more than one fund and can change their investment direction twice a year. A total of 3,223 and 3,316 active
and former employees had investments in the Plan for 1999 and 1998, respectively.
4. Participant Accounts and Benefits:
All participants are fully vested in their contributions and the Company match. The benefit to which a Plan participant is entitled is the amount
provided by contributions (Company and participant) and investment earnings thereon (including net realized and unrealized investment gains
and losses) which have been allocated to such participant's account balance. Allocations are based on participant's earnings or account balance,
as defined.
Participants are allowed to withdraw their after-tax contributions and earnings thereon, at any time. Participants may withdraw before-tax
contributions only upon meeting certain hardship conditions.

6. Tax Status:
The Plan constitutes as a qualified plan under Section 165(a) of the Puerto Rico Income Tax Act of 1954 as amended, (the "ITA"), and the Plan
and related Trust accounts are exempt from Puerto Rico income taxes under
Section 165(a) and 165(e) of the ITA.
The Plan has been amended since receiving the determination letter. However, the Plan administrator and the Plan's tax counsel believe that the
Plan is currently designed and operated in compliance with the applicable requirements of the Puerto Rico tax code. Therefore, no provision for
income taxes has been included in the Plan's financial statements.
7. Termination Priorities:
The Company has the right to terminate the Plan at any time and in the event the Plan is terminated, subject to conditions set forth in ERISA,
the amount of each participant's account balance in the Plan is fully vested.

1REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Pension and Benefits Committees of Johnson & Johnson
In our opinion, the accompanying statements of net assets available for benefits and the related statements of changes in net assets available for
benefits present fairly, in all material respects, the net assets available for benefits of the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan for Union
Represented Employees (the "Plan") as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the changes in net assets available for benefits for the years then
ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Plan's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The supplemental
schedule of assets held for investment purposes and schedule of reportable transactions are presented for the purpose of additional analysis and
are not a required part of the basic financial statements but are supplementary information required by the Department of Labor's Rules and
Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. These supplemental schedules are the
responsibility of the Plan's management. The fund information in the statements of net assets available for benefits and the statements of
changes in net assets available for benefits is presented for the purposes of additional analysis rather than to present the net assets available for
benefits and changes in net assets available for benefits of each fund. The supplemental schedules and fund information have been subjected to
the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

6JOHNSON & JOHNSON SAVINGS PLAN
FOR UNION REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Organization:
The Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan for Union Represented Employees (the "Plan") is a defined contribution plan which was established on
January 1, 1993 by Johnson & Johnson ("J&J" or the "Company"). The Plan was designed to enhance the existing retirement program of
eligible employees covered under collective bargaining agreements with the Company. The funding of the Plan is made through employee and
Company contributions. The assets of the Plan are maintained in a Master Trust account ("Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan Trust") and
transactions therein are executed by the trustee, Bankers Trust Company. The Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan Trust is allocated based upon
the total of each individual participant's share of the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan Trust.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
Valuation of Investments:
Equity investments in the Johnson & Johnson Stock Fund, administered by Bankers Trust Company, are valued at the average of the high and
low market price on the last business day of the year. The cost of equity investments in the Johnson & Johnson Stock Fund are recorded at the
average market price of the stock transactions for the month during which the contribution is made.
The investments in the US Government Securities ("USGS"), Fixed Interest and Diversified Equity Funds represent the Plan's share of assets in
the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan Trust. The USGS Fund consists of short-term obligations that are issued or guaranteed by the US
Government. Investments are valued at cost, which approximates market value. Deposits in group annuity contracts in the Fixed Interest Fund
are recorded at their contract value, which approximates fair value, because these investments have fully benefit-responsive features. Contract
value represents contributions and reinvested income, less any withdrawals plus accrued interest. Participants may direct the withdrawal or
transfer of all or a portion of their investment at contract value. However, withdrawals influenced by employer initiated events, such as in
connection with the sale of a business, may result in a distribution at other than contract value. There are no reserves against contract values for
credit risk of contract issuers or otherwise. The average yield and crediting interest rate of the Fixed Interest Fund was 5.99% for 1999 and
6.62% for 1998. The crediting interest rate for the investment contracts is either agreed-to in advance with the issuer or varies based on an
agreed-to formula, but cannot be less than zero.
7JOHNSON & JOHNSON SAVINGS PLAN
FOR UNION REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued):
Equity investments and corporate obligations in the Diversified Equity Fund, managed by the Capital Guardian Trust Company and J.P.
Morgan Investment Management, Inc., are traded on a national securities exchange and are valued at the last reported market sales price on the
last business day of the year. Investments in the Diversified Equity Fund are purchased periodically by Capital Guardian Trust Company and
J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc. based on the prevailing market values of the underlying investments.
Temporary cash investments are stated at redemption value which approximates fair value.
Transfers:
Transfers among funds, which are made at the participant's election, have been presented as assets transferred in the Statement of Changes in
Net Assets Available for Benefits.
Use of Estimates:
The preparation of the Plan's financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the
plan administrator to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of net assets available for benefits at the date of the
financial statements and the changes in net assets available for benefits during the reporting period and, when applicable, disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Risks and Uncertainties:
The Plan provides for various participant investment options in funds which can invest in any combination of stocks, bonds, fixed income
securities, mutual funds, and other investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market and
credit. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of
investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in risks in the near term would materially affect participants' account
balances and the amounts reported in the statements of net assets available for benefits and the statements of changes in net assets available for
benefits.
Other:
Interest and dividend income is recorded as earned on the accrual basis. Purchases and sales of investment securities are reflected on a trade-
date basis. Gains and losses on sales of investment securities are determined on the average cost method. Third party administrative expenses
are paid by the Plan, except costs of entering new investment vehicles which will be paid primarily by Johnson & Johnson.
8JOHNSON & JOHNSON SAVINGS PLAN
FOR UNION REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued
3. Contributions:
Participating employees may contribute a minimum of $0.16 per hour up to a maximum of $1.60 per hour, depending on the negotiated
contract rate, of the first forty hours worked in each payroll week. All contributions are on a pre-tax basis. Annual pre-tax contributions may
not exceed $10,000 in 1999 or 1998. The Company contributes to the Plan, out of current or accumulated profits, an amount equal to 25% or
40% (depending on the negotiated collective bargaining agreement) of the employee directed contributions on the first $0.16 to $0.80 per hour
directly into J&J common stock.
Contributions are made to the Plan by participants through payroll deductions and by the Company on behalf of the participants. Employee
contributions are to be invested in any of the four investment funds at the direction of the participating employees. All Company contributions
are made to the J&J Stock Fund.
The number of participants invested in each fund at December 31, 1999 and 1998 was:
1999 1998
---- ----
U.S. Government Securities Fund 506 542
Fixed Interest Fund 719 767
Johnson & Johnson Stock Fund 2,152 2,166
Diversified Equity Fund 1,172 1,171
Participants may elect to invest in more than one fund and can change their investment direction twice a year. A total of 2,154 and 2,167 active
and former employees had investments in the Plan for 1999 and 1998, respectively.
4. Participant Accounts and Benefits:
All participants are fully vested in their contributions and the Company match. The benefit to which a Plan participant is entitled is the amount
provided by contributions (Company and participant) and investment earnings thereon (including net realized and unrealized investment gains
and losses) which have been allocated to such participant's account balance. Allocations are based on participant's earnings or account balances,
as defined.
Participants may withdraw their after-tax contributions and earnings thereon, at any time. Participants may withdraw before-tax contributions
only upon meeting certain hardship conditions.

6. Tax Status:
The Internal Revenue Service has determined and informed the Company by a letter dated April 26, 1996, that the Plan and related trust are
designed in accordance with applicable sections of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The Plan has been amended since receiving the
determination letter. However, the Plan administrator believes that the Plan is designed and is currently being operated in compliance with
applicable requirements of the IRC.
7. Termination Priorities:
The Company has the right to terminate the Plan at any time and in the event the Plan is terminated, subject to conditions set forth in ERISA,
the amount of each participant's account balance in the Plan is fully vested.
8. Concentrations of Credit Risk:
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Plan to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of the Fixed Interest Fund holdings
in fully benefit-responsive group annuity contracts with insurance and other financial institutions.
The Fund places its fully benefit-responsive group annuity contracts with high-credit quality institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of
credit exposure to any one financial institution. If any of the insurance companies that the group annuity contracts are invested with fail to
perform according to the contract, the asset value of the Plan could be impaired.

2Report of Independent Accountants
To the 401(k) Administrative Committee of Centocor, Inc.:
In our opinion, the accompanying statements of net assets available for plan benefits and the related statements of changes in net assets
available for plan benefits present fairly, in all material respects, the net assets available for plan benefits of the Centocor Qualified Savings and
Retirement Plan (the "Plan") as of December 31, 1999, and the changes in net assets available for plan benefits for the year then ended, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plan's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis
for the opinion expressed above. The statement of net assets available for plan benefits and the related statement of changes in net assets
available for plan benefits of the Plan as of December 31, 1998 and for the year then ended were audited by other independent accountants
whose report dated June 18, 1999 expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The supplemental schedule
of assets held for investment purposes is presented for the purpose of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial
statements but is supplemental information required by the Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. This supplemental schedule is the responsibility of the Plan's management. The
supplemental schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, is
fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Accounting
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting.
Investments
The Centocor Qualified Savings and Retirement Plan's (the "Plan") Investments, administered by The Vanguard Group, Inc. (the "Trustee"),
are stated at fair value based on the market value of the underlying securities on the last business day of the year.
Johnson & Johnson common shares are carried at market value which is determined by quoted market prices. Participant loans are valued at
cost which approximates fair value.
Purchases and sales of investment securities are reflected on a trade date basis. Gains and losses on sales of investment securities are
determined on the average cost method.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and changes therein, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of additions and deductions during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from estimates.
Risks and Uncertainties
The Plan provides for various participant investment options in funds which can invest in any combination of stocks, bonds, fixed income
securities, mutual funds and other investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market and
credit. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of
investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in risks in the near term would materially affect participants' account
balances and the amounts reported in the statements of net assets available for plan benefits and the statements of changes in net assets
available for plan benefits.
6CENTOCOR QUALIFIED SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLAN
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Related Party Transactions
Certain Plan investments are shares of mutual funds managed by the Trustee. Therefore, these transactions qualify as party-in-interest.
Payment of benefits
Benefit payments are recorded when paid.
NOTE 2 DESCRIPTION OF PLAN
The following description of the Plan provides only general information. Participants should refer to the Plan document for a more complete
description of the Plan's provisions.
General
Effective January 1, 1985, Centocor, Inc. (the "Company") established the Plan, a defined contribution savings plan subject to the provisions of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"). Substantially all U.S. employees of the Company, or any of its subsidiaries
or affiliates, are eligible to participate in the Plan. Employees may participate as of the first date of his/her employment. Substantially all of the
legal, accounting and administrative expenses associated with Plan operations are currently paid by the Company. On October 6, 1999, the
Company and Johnson & Johnson completed a merger between the two companies.
Contributions
Eligible employees may make voluntary tax-deferred contributions of 1 to 15 percent of their eligible cash compensation up to certain annual
limits as prescribed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Maximum annual contributions may be limited at the discretion of the Company.
Employee contributions are invested as directed by the employee in any of the eight investment programs available under an investment
contract with the Trustee (see Note 3). Company contributions are made principally in the Johnson & Johnson Common Stock Fund.
The Company may elect, but is not required, to make contributions to the Plan for the benefit of the participating employees. To date,
contributions have been made as a percentage of the participants' contributions for the year, as determined by the Company's Board of
Directors. In 1999 and 1998, the Company elected to contribute an amount equal to 50 percent of the contributions of each employee. The
Company's contribution is based upon annual employee contributions up to a level of 6 percent of their cash compensation. Additionally, in
1999 and 1998, the Company committed to make a contribution equal to 1% of each employee's compensation. At December 31, 1999, 26,224
shares of the Johnson & Johnson
7CENTOCOR QUALIFIED SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLAN
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Common Stock Fund with a fair value of $94.016 per share determined by the average trade price for the last twenty days in December and
$66.33 in cash was due to the Plan from the Company for its 1999 contribution.
Participants' Accounts
Separate accounts are maintained by the Trustee for each participant. Each participant's account reflects the participant's contribution, the
Company's contribution, interest, dividends, other income, and gains or losses earned by each of the investment programs. Investment income
is reinvested in the same programs.
Participants may transfer all or a portion of their accounts among the eight investment programs available under the Plan by directly contacting
the Trustee. The transfer would take effect immediately upon the participant's notification of the change.
Vesting
Employee contributions are fully (100%) vested and non-forfeitable. Employer contributions are fully vested upon death, total and permanent
disability, or attainment of age 65; otherwise, employer contributions are subject to vesting percentages based on years of service, as defined by
the Plan documents. Employee non-vested forfeitures are used by the Company to offset employer contributions. The amount of forfeitures for
1999 and 1998 were $89,241 and $19,011, respectively. The employer contributions vesting percentages are as follows:
Less than one year of service 0%
One year of service 20%
Two years of service 40%
Three years of service 60%
Four years of service 80%
Five or more years of service 100%
Payment of Benefits
Benefits from the participants' vested accounts are normally payable to Plan participants upon retirement, death, termination of Company
employment or total and permanent disability. There are no benefits payable to former employees at December 31, 1999 and 1998.
A participant, while still an employee, may generally withdraw all or a portion of his vested, non-forfeitable tax-deferred contribution account
if such amount is needed to defray the cost of a medical emergency, enable the participant to acquire or improve his principal residence, or
assist the participant in preventing eviction or foreclosure proceedings. Such a withdrawal must first be taken as a loan as noted below.
8CENTOCOR QUALIFIED SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLAN
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Any additional funds required will be distributed as a hardship withdrawal subject to income tax and penalties. Such loan and withdrawal shall
not exceed the amount required to meet the immediate financial need created by the hardship and shall not be reasonably available from other
sources of the participant.
Loan Provisions
Participants may borrow from their accounts a minimum of $1,000 up to a maximum equal to the lesser of $50,000 or 50% of their account
balance and may have only one loan outstanding at any point of time. All such loans bear interest at prevailing market rates. Loans must be
repaid within five years in approximately equal installments or up to 15 years if used for the purchase of a primary residence. Loans are secured
by the balance in participant accounts.
Transfer of Net Assets
In November 1998 the Company sold its oncology diagnostics business. Immediately following the closing of the sale, $3,958,022 of the Plan's
net assets related to diagnostic oncology employees were transferred from the Company's Plan to the plan sponsored by the acquiring company.

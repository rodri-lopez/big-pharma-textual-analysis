PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
Johnson & Johnson, employing approximately 109,900 people worldwide, is
engaged in the manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health
care field. Johnson & Johnson has over 200 subsidiaries that conduct business in
virtually all countries of the world. Johnson & Johnson's primary interest, both
historically and currently, has been in products related to human health and
well-being. Johnson & Johnson was organized in the State of New Jersey in 1887.
Johnson & Johnson is organized on the principle of decentralized
management. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal
management group responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources
of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the
Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments.
Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed
by citizens of the country in which it is located.
SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS
Johnson & Johnson's worldwide business is divided into three segments:
Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Additional
information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the
narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of segments and
operating results under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
Operations and Financial Condition" on pages 28 through 38 and 64 of Johnson &
Johnson's Annual Report to Shareholders for fiscal year 2004 which is filed as
Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.
CONSUMER
The Consumer segment manufactures and markets a broad range of products
used in the baby and child care, skin care, oral and wound care and women's
health care fields, as well as over-the-counter pharmaceutical and nutritional
products. Major brands include AVEENO skin care products; BAND-AID Brand
Adhesive Bandages; CAREFREE Pantiliners; CLEAN & CLEAR teen skin care products;
JOHNSON'S Baby line of products; MOTRIN IB ibuprofen products; PEPCID AC Acid
Controller from Johnson & Johnson - Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co.;
NEUTROGENA skin and hair care products; RoC skin care products; SPLENDA, a no
calorie sweetener; STAYFREE sanitary protection products; and the broad family
of TYLENOL acetaminophen products. These products are marketed principally to
the general public and sold both to wholesalers and directly to independent and
chain retail outlets throughout the world.
PHARMACEUTICAL
The Pharmaceutical segment's principal worldwide franchises are in the
antifungal, anti-infective, cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology,
gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management,
psychotropic (central nervous system) and urology fields. These products are
distributed both directly and through wholesalers and health care professionals
for use by prescription by the general public. Key products in the
Pharmaceutical segment include: PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as
EPREX), a biotechnology derived product that stimulates red blood cell
production; DURAGESIC (fentanyl transdermal system, sold abroad as DUROGESIC), atreatment for chronic pain that offers a novel delivery system; RISPERDAL
(risperidone) and RISPERDAL CONSTA (risperidone long-acting injection), for
treatment of the symptoms of schizophrenia; REMICADE (infliximab), a novel
monoclonal antibody therapy indicated to treat the symptoms of Crohn's disease,
rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis; LEVAQUIN (levofloxacin) and
FLOXIN (ofloxacin), both in the anti-infective field; TOPAMAX (topiramate), an
anti-epileptic and migraine prevention treatment; ORTHO EVRA
(norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol transdermal system), the first contraceptive
patch approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN LO
(norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol), a low dose oral contraceptive; DOXIL
(doxorubicin), a cancer treatment; DITROPAN XL (oxybutynin chloride), for
<PAGE>
the treatment of overactive bladder; REMINYL (galantamine HBr), for patients
with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease; NATRECOR (nesiritide), a novel agent
approved for congestive heart failure; VELCADE (bortezomib), an oncology
treatment; and CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) a product for the treatment of
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
MEDICAL DEVICES AND DIAGNOSTICS
The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of
products used by or under the direction of physicians, nurses, therapists,
hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and clinics. These products include Ethicon's
wound care and women's health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery's minimally
invasive surgical products; Cordis' circulatory disease management products;
LifeScan's blood glucose monitoring products; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics'
professional diagnostic products; DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction,
spinal and sports medicine products and Vistakon's disposable contact lenses.
Distribution to these health care professional markets is done both directly and
through surgical supply and other dealers.
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS
The international business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by
subsidiaries located in 56 countries outside the United States, which are
selling products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products
made and sold in the international business include many of those described
above under "Business -- Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and
Diagnostics." However, the principal markets, products and methods of
distribution in the international business vary with the country and the
culture. The products sold in international business include not only those
which were developed in the United States but also those which were developed by
subsidiaries abroad.
Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are
subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment
and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive economic policies and
political uncertainties.
RAW MATERIALS
Raw materials essential to Johnson & Johnson's operating companies'
businesses are generally readily available from multiple sources.
PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of obtaining patent protection on its
products and processes where possible. Johnson & Johnson owns or is licensed
under a number of patents relating to its products and manufacturing processes,
which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the
operation of its business. Sales of the Company's two largest products, PROCRIT
and RISPERDAL, each accounted for over 5% of Johnson & Johnson's total revenues
for 2004. Accordingly, the patents related to these products are believed to be
material in relation to Johnson & Johnson as a whole.
During 2004 and 2005, DURAGESIC (fentanyl transdermal system) in the United
States and EPREX in international markets have lost or will lose their basic
patent protection and will be subject to generic competition. The pediatric
exclusivity for the DURAGESIC patent expired in the U.S. in January 2005. The
first generic version of DURAGESIC has been launched. Foreign patent protection
related to DURAGESIC will expire during 2005. The Company expects that DURAGESIC
sales will decline in 2005 as compared to 2004.
During 2004, patents related to EPREX in certain international markets
expired. Generic competition will be limited in the near term due to the lack of
biologically equivalent compounds. Sales of DURAGESIC and EPREX accounted for
over 7% of Johnson & Johnson's worldwide sales in 2004. There are no other major
product patents that are scheduled to expire during the next 2 years.
Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of selling its products undertrademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available
means. Johnson & Johnson's trademarks are protected by registration in the
United States and other countries where its products are marketed. Johnson &
Johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance
in the operation of its business.
2
<PAGE>
SEASONALITY
Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality;
however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in
other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for
advertising and research grants.
COMPETITION
In all of their product lines, Johnson & Johnson companies compete with
companies both large and small, located in the United States and abroad.
Competition is strong in all lines without regard to the number and size of the
competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development
of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and
processes, is particularly significant and results from time to time in product
and process obsolescence. The development of new and improved products is
important to Johnson & Johnson's success in all areas of its business. This
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research
and in multiple sales forces. In addition, the winning and retention of customer
acceptance of the products of Johnson & Johnson's consumer businesses involve
heavy expenditures for advertising, promotion and selling.
RESEARCH
Research activities are important to all segments of Johnson & Johnson's
business. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States
but also in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada and the United Kingdom. The costs
of Johnson & Johnson's worldwide research activities relating to the development
of new products, the improvement of existing products, technical support of
products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of the
consumer amounted to $5,203, $4,684 and $3,957 million for fiscal years 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. These costs are charged directly to income in the
year in which incurred. All research was sponsored by Johnson & Johnson.
ENVIRONMENT
During the past year Johnson & Johnson companies were subject to a variety
of federal, state and local environmental protection measures. Johnson & Johnson
believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable
environmental laws and regulations. Johnson & Johnson's compliance with these
requirements did not and is not expected to have a material effect upon its
capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.
REGULATION
Most of Johnson & Johnson's business is subject to varying degrees of
governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and
the general trend is toward regulation of increasing stringency. In the United
States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been
subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies, primarily as
to product safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling. The exercise of broad
regulatory powers by the Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") continues to
result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA
clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense
of product introduction. Similar trends toward product and process regulation
are also evident in a number of major countries outside of the United States,
especially in the European Economic Community where efforts are continuing to
harmonize the internal regulatory systems.
The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of
study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative
bodies in the United States and other countries. In the United States, attention
has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors
to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend particular medical
devices. Managed care has become a more potent force in the market place and it
is likely that increased attention will be paid to drug and medical device
pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality of
health care. There is also
3
<PAGE>uncertainty as to the impact of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act which was enacted in the latter part of 2003.
The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson & Johnson operates have
administrative powers that may subject Johnson & Johnson to such actions as
product recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In
some cases Johnson & Johnson may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls
voluntarily.
In addition, sales, marketing and other business practices in the health
care industry have come under increased scrutiny by government agencies and
state attorney generals and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the
risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.
While the Company's affiliates do not sell any COX-2 inhibitor medicines,
the recent developments involving those medicines (such as Vioxx and Celebrex)
are likely to have implications throughout the health care industry.

In addition to the manufacturing facilities discussed above, Johnson &
Johnson maintains numerous office and warehouse facilities throughout the world.
Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 under "Business -- Research."
Johnson & Johnson generally seeks to own its manufacturing facilities,
although some, principally in locations abroad, are leased. Office and warehouse
facilities are often leased.
Johnson & Johnson's properties are maintained in good operating condition
and repair and are well utilized.
For information regarding lease obligations see Note 4 "Rental Expense and
Lease Commitments" under "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 46
of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K. Segment
information on Additions to Property, Plant & Equipment is contained on page 64
of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The information set forth in Note 18 "Legal Proceedings" under "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" on pages 56 through 61 of the Annual Report
is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on
Form 10-K.
The Company or its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings
brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state laws, in which
the primary relief sought is the cost of past and future remediation. While it
is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in the
opinion of the Company, such proceedings would not have a material adverse
effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the
Company.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
Not applicable.ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
DISCLOSURE CONTROLS. At the end of the fiscal fourth quarter, the Company
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure
controls and procedures. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that the Company records, processes, summarizes and reports
in a timely manner the information the Company must disclose in its reports
filed under the Securities Exchange Act. William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, and Robert J. Darretta, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial
Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation,
Messrs. Weldon and Darretta concluded that, as of the date of their evaluation,
the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
INTERNAL CONTROL. Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting is included in this Report on Form 10-K in this Item 9A. During the
fiscal quarter ended January 2, 2005, there were no significant changes in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal
control over financial reporting.
MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. Under
Section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess
the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as
of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the
Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as
to the reliability of the Company's financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has
inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
8
<PAGE>
respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all
misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company's management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2005. In making this
assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in "Internal
Control-Integrated Framework." These criteria are in the areas of control
environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication,
and monitoring. The Company's assessment included extensive documenting,
evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal
control over financial reporting.
Based on the Company's processes and assessment, as described above,
management has concluded that, as of January 2, 2005, the Company's internal
control over financial reporting was effective.
Management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2005 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which appears in the "Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm" on page 63 of the Annual Report, which is incorporated
herein by reference.

<DESCRIPTION>DEFERRED FEE PLAN FOR DIRECTORS (AS AMENDED)
<TEXT>
<PAGE>
EXHIBIT 10 (h)
JOHNSON & JOHNSON
DEFERRED FEE PLAN FOR DIRECTORS
(Amended as of February 14, 2005)
1. Purpose. The purpose of the Johnson & Johnson Deferred Fee Plan for
Directors (the "Plan") is to provide outside Directors of Johnson & Johnson (the
"Company") the opportunity to defer receipt of compensation earned as a Director
to a date following termination of such service. The provision of such an
opportunity is designed to aid the Company in attracting and retaining as
members of its Board of Directors persons whose abilities, experience and
judgment can contribute to the well being of the Company.
2. Effective Date. The original effective date of the Plan was January 1,
1983. The Plan was amended in its entirety, effective as of January 1, 1995 and
again as of December 5, 1996.
3. Eligibility. Any Director of the Company who is not also an Employee of
the Company or any related company shall be eligible to participate in the Plan.
4. Deferred Compensation Account. A deferred compensation account shall be
established for each Director.
5. Amount of Deferral. Each participant (effective retroactive to January
1, 2005) may elect to defer receipt of all or a specified part of any cash
compensation payable to the participant for serving on the Board of Directors or
for serving on committees of the Board of Directors of the Company. An amount
equal to all deferred compensation will be credited to the participant's
deferred compensation account on a quarterly basis as of the dividend payment
date in each quarter (the "Payment Date"). In the event that there shall not be
a dividend payment date in any quarter, then the Payment Date shall be deemed to
be the last business day of such quarter.
6. Deferred Compensation Account - Hypothetical Investment Options.
(a) Unless otherwise specified by the participant pursuant to the
terms of paragraph (b) of this Section 6, all amounts elected to be deferred
under this Plan for any calendar year ("Deferrals") shall be credited to the
participant's deferred compensation account, converted into equivalent units of
Johnson & Johnson Common Stock ("Company Stock") and adjusted as if the
compensation deferred had been invested in Company Stock as of the Payment Date,
until the date of final payment pursuant to Section 9 hereof ("Company Stock
Equivalent Units"). The number of Company Stock Equivalent Units shall be
determined by dividing the amount of compensation payable by the average of the
high and low price of the Company Stock as traded on the New York Stock Exchange
on the trading day immediately prior to the Payment Date, as reported by
Bloomberg (or another financial reporting service selected by the Company in its
sole discretion). The number of Company Stock Equivalent Units included in a
participant's deferred compensation account shall be adjusted to reflect
dividends and the value of such account shall be adjusted to reflect increases
or decreases in market value which would have resulted had funds equal to the
balance of the participant's deferred compensation account been invested in
Company Stock. Nothing herein obligates the
<PAGE>
Company to purchase any such Company Stock; and if such Company Stock is
purchased, it shall remain the sole property of the Company.
(b) At the election of each participant, to be made as provided for
in Section 7, each deferred compensation account will be credited with interest
from the Payment Date, until the date of final payment pursuant to Section 9
hereof, at a rate equal to the annual rate of growth of investment in the
Johnson & Johnson Certificate of Extra Compensation Plan (the "CEC Plan"), for
the prior year provided, however, that the computation of said growth rate shall
not include dividend equivalents paid under the CEC Plan. The election permitted
under this Section 6(b) shall not be available to any participant who becomes a
participant in the Plan after December 31, 1995.
(c) With respect to Company Stock Equivalent Units in a deferred
compensation account, the Company shall credit such account on each dividend
payment date declared with respect to the Company's Stock, a number of Company
Stock Equivalent Units equal to: (i) the product of (y) the dividend per shareof the Company's Stock which is payable as of the dividend payment date,
multiplied by (z) the number of Company Stock Equivalent Units credited to such
account as of the applicable dividend record date, divided by (ii) the average
of the high and low price of the Company Stock as traded on the New York Stock
Exchange on the trading day immediately prior to the dividend payment date, as
reported by Bloomberg (or another financial reporting service selected by the
Company in its sole discretion). Fractional Company Stock Equivalent Units shall
be carried forward and fractional dividend equivalent units shall be payable
thereon.
(d) All account balances in Company Stock Equivalent Units from the
Company's Retirement Plan for Nonemployee Directors which have been transferred
to his/her deferred compensation account under this Plan, as of January 1, 1995,
by reason of the termination of such Retirement Plan, shall be treated for
purposes of this Plan as Deferrals.
7. Time of Election of Deferral. A participant may change (i) the amount
of compensation deferred and/or (ii) the option elected under Section 6 with
respect to his/her account and deferrals for subsequent years, once annually in
December by completing forms provided by the Company for that purpose. Any such
change shall become effective on January 1 of the following year. If a
participant elects to change his/her investment option available under Section
6, the participant's account shall be valued as of December 31 with that value
being entered into his/her account under the new investment option as of the
following January 1 (except if such change is to Company Stock Equivalent Units,
the first trading day following such January 1 shall be used).
8. Value of Deferred Compensation Account. The value of each participant's
deferred compensation account shall, as the case may be, include compensation
deferred, interest credited thereon, if any, and any adjustments for dividends,
and increases or decreases in the market value of Company Stock, pursuant to the
option selected under Section 6 or as otherwise required under the Plan. If the
Company Stock does not trade on any date a calculation of Common Stock
Equivalent Units is to be made under the Plan, the next preceding date on which
such stock was traded shall be utilized.
9. Payment of Deferred Compensation. Upon a participant's completion of
service as a member of the Board of Directors (the "Completion Date"), each
participant (or in the event of the participant's death, the named beneficiary
or his/her estate) shall be entitled to receive in cash in a lump sum the value
of his/her deferred compensation
<PAGE>
account as of the Completion Date, unless such participant has elected, pursuant
to the provisions of Section 10 below, to further defer payment of his/her
deferred compensation account beyond such Completion Date. Company Stock
Equivalent Units shall be valued at the average of the high and low price of the
Company's Stock as traded on the New York Stock Exchange on the trading day
immediately prior to such date, as reported by Bloomberg (or another financial
reporting service selected by the Company in its sole discretion). No withdrawal
may be made from the participant's deferred compensation account prior to the
Completion Date. The value of a participant's deferred compensation account
shall, subject to any further election made pursuant to Section 10 below, be
paid as soon as practicable following the Completion Date or death.
10. Further Deferral Election. In addition to the deferral elections
referred to above, a participant may also elect (in the manner provided for
below) to continue to defer the receipt of his/her deferred compensation account
beyond his/her Completion Date. The value of a participant's account on his/her
Completion Date may be deferred for up to 10 taxable years following such
Completion Date. If installments are elected, the first installment payment may
be made immediately at the Completion Date or be deferred for up to 10 taxable
years. Installment payments will be made annually (in the manner described
below) in approximately equal amounts (i.e. the balance of the account). The
minimum number of installments is two and the maximum number is 10 provided,
however, that all payments shall be made within ten (10) years of the Completion
Date. A participant may elect to defer up to 100% of the value of his/her
account at the Completion Date; or any percentage increment less than that. All
deferred or installment payments shall be made in cash. The following additional
rules shall apply:
a) Immediate Lump Sum Payment. The participant will receive the full value
of his/her account in the calendar month of his/her Completion Date.
b) Deferred Lump Sum Payment. The participant will receive the full value
of his/her account on or about January 15 of the year he/she elects to receive
payment in.
c) Immediate Commencement of Installments. The participant will receive
the first installment in the calendar month of his/her Completion Date. Allsubsequent installments on or about January 15 of each year.
d) Deferred Commencement of Installments. The participant will receive the
first and all subsequent installments on or about January 15 of each year.
e) In the event of death of a participant, the Company will make payment
in full of the balance of an account, as soon as administratively practical in a
single lump sum payment to the designated beneficiary or his/her estate.
f) In making any payment due on or about January 15, the value of a
participant's account on the first trading day of such month shall be utilized.
Any and all deferrals following a Completion Date shall be invested in
Company Stock Equivalent Units described in Section 6(a) above. To the extent a
participant's account was credited with the annual growth rate of an investment
in the CEC Plan (as described in Section 6(b) above), such account shall be
converted to Common Stock Equivalent units as of the Completion Date.
An election by a participant to defer payment or elect installments of all
or a part of his/her deferred compensation account beyond the Completion Date
must be made a
<PAGE>
minimum of twelve (12) months prior to such Completion Date. Any such election
may be revised or revoked up to twelve (12) months prior to such Completion
Date; after such time any election may not be revoked or otherwise revised.
Notwithstanding the above and upon implementation of the Plan, an
exception has been made for participants having a Completion Date during 1997.
For such participants, the deferral and or installment election must be made a
minimum of three (3) months and in the calendar year prior to the Completion
Date. For example, a participant having a Completion Date of April 1, 1997, must
make the deferral and/or installment election no later than December 31, 1996.
Any such election to defer and/or receive installment payments may only be
revised or revoked prior to the last permissible date for making such election.
After such time the election may not be revoked or otherwise revised.
An election to defer payment and/or be paid in installments beyond a
Completion Date is effective only when filed with Extra Compensation Services on
the form utilized for such purposes. Any election made after the required
deadline shall be disregarded.
11. Designation of Beneficiary. Each participant may, from time to time,
by writing filed with the Secretary of the Company, designate any legal or
natural person or persons (who may be designated contingently or successively)
to whom payments of a participant's deferred compensation account are to be made
if a participant dies prior to the receipt of payment of such account. A
beneficiary designation will be effective only if the signed form is filed with
the Secretary of the Company while the participant is alive and will cancel all
beneficiary designation forms filed earlier. If a participant fails to designate
a beneficiary as provided above, or if all designated beneficiaries die before
the participant or before complete payment of the deferred compensation account,
such account shall be paid to the estate of the last to die of the participant
and designated beneficiaries as soon as practicable after such death.
12. Participant's Rights Unsecured. The right of any participant to
receive payment under the provisions of the Plan shall be an unsecured claim
against the general assets of the Company, and no provisions contained in the
Plan shall be construed to give any participant or beneficiary at any time a
security interest in any deferred compensation account or any other asset in
trust with the Company for the benefit of any participant or beneficiary.
13. Statement of Account. A statement will be sent to participants as soon
as practical following the end of each year as to the value of his/her deferred
compensation account as of December 31 of such year.
14. Assignability. No right to receive payments hereunder shall be
transferable or assignable by a participant or a beneficiary, except by will or
by the laws of descent and distribution.
15. Administration of the Plan. The Plan shall be administered by a
Committee appointed by and responsible to the Board of Directors. The Committee
shall consist of no less than three Directors of the Company. The Committee
shall act by vote or written consent of a majority of its members.
16. Amendment or Termination of Plan. This Plan may at any time or from
time to time be amended, modified or terminated by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors or the Board of Directors of the Company. No amendment,
modification or<PAGE>
termination shall, without the consent of a participant, adversely affect such
participant's accruals in his deferred compensation accounts.
17. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of New Jersey.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
Condition
Organization and Business Segments
Description of the Company and Business Segments
The Company and its subsidiaries have approximately 109,900 employees worldwide
engaged in the manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health
care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the
world and its primary focus has been in products related to human health and
well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical
and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. The Consumer segment manufactures and
markets a broad range of products used in the baby and child care, skin care,
oral and wound care and women's health care fields, as well as nutritional and
over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. These products are marketed
principally to the general public and sold both to wholesalers and directly to
independent and chain retail outlets throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical
segment includes products in the following therapeutic areas: anti-fungal,
anti-infective, cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology, gastrointestinal,
hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management, psychotropic
(central nervous system) and urology areas. These products are distributed
directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for
prescription use by the general public. The Medical Devices and Diagnostics
segment includes a broad range of products used principally in the professional
fields by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and
clinics. These products include circulatory disease management products; DePuy's
orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal care products; Ethicon's wound care
and women's health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery's minimally invasive surgical
products; LifeScan's blood glucose monitoring products; Ortho-Clinical
Diagnostics' professional diagnostic products and Vision Care's disposable
contact lenses.
The Company's structure is based upon the principle of decentralized management.
The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group
responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources of the Company.
This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer,
Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments. Each
subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by
citizens of the country where it is located.
In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both large and
small, located throughout the world. Competition is strong in all product lines
without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.
Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new
and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The
development of new and improved products is important to the Company's success
in all areas of its business. This competitive environment requires substantial
investments in continuing research and multiple sales forces. In addition, the
development and maintenance of customer acceptance of the Company's consumer
products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
<PAGE>
Management's Objectives
The Company's objective is to achieve superior levels of capital efficient
profitable growth. To accomplish this, the Company's management operates the
business consistent with certain strategic principles that have proven
successful over time. To this end, the Company participates in growth areas in
human health care and is committed to attaining leadership positions in these
growth segments through the development of innovative products and services. New
products introduced within the past five years accounted for over 35% of 2004
sales. In 2004, $5.2 billion or 11.0% of sales were invested in research and
development, recognizing the importance of on-going development of new and
differentiated products and services, and to sustain long term growth.
With more than 200 operating companies located in 57 countries, the Companyviews its principle of decentralized management as an asset and fundamental to
the success of a broadly based business. It also fosters an entrepreneurial
spirit, combining the extensive resources of a large organization with the
ability to react quickly to local market changes and challenges.
The Company is committed to developing global business leaders who can drive our
growth objectives. Businesses are managed for the long term in order to sustain
leadership positions and achieve growth that provides an enduring source of
value to our shareholders.
Unifying the management team and the Company's dedicated employees in achieving
these objectives is the Johnson & Johnson Credo. The Credo provides a common set
of values and serves as a constant reminder of the Company's responsibilities to
its customers, employees, communities and shareholders. The Company believes
that these basic principles, along with its overall mission of improving the
quality of life for people everywhere, will enable Johnson & Johnson to continue
to be among the leaders in the health care industry.
Results of Operations
Analysis of Consolidated Sales
In 2004, worldwide sales increased 13.1% to $47.3 billion, compared to increases
of 15.3% in 2003 and 12.3% in 2002. These sales increases consist of the
following:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

Volume 8.7% 9.4 10.4
Price 1.0 1.3 1.7
Currency 3.4 4.6 0.2
Total 13.1% 15.3 12.3
</TABLE>
Sales by U.S. companies were $27.7 billion in 2004, $25.3 billion in 2003 and
$22.5 billion in 2002. This represents an increase of 9.9% in 2004, 12.6% in
2003 and 13.3% in 2002. Sales by international companies were $19.6 billion in
2004, $16.6 billion in 2003 and $13.8 billion in 2002. This represents an
increase of 18.0% in 2004, 19.8% in 2003 and 10.8% in 2002.

<PAGE>
[graph]
For the last five years, the annual compound growth rates for worldwide, U.S.
and international sales were 11.6%, 12.3% and 10.6%, respectively. The ten-year
annual compound growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were
11.8%, 13.6% and 9.7%, respectively.
[graph]
All international geographic areas experienced double-digit sales growth during
2004, consisting of 17.6% in Europe, 15.8% in the Western Hemisphere (excluding
the U.S.) and 19.9% in the Asia-Pacific, Africa regions. These sales gains
include a positive impact of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and
foreign currencies in Europe of 10.5%, in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the
U.S.) of 4.2% and in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region of 6.6%.
In 2004, sales to our three largest distributors, Cardinal Distribution,
McKesson HBOC and AmerisourceBergen Corp. accounted for 10.2%, 10.0% and 7.5%,
respectively, of total revenues. In 2003 and 2002, sales to those distributors
accounted for 9.1%, 10.5% and 9.0% and 9.2%, 9.8% and 10.3%, respectively, of
total revenues.
2004 results benefited from the inclusion of a 53rd week. (See Note 1 for Annual
Closing Date details.) The Company estimated that the fourth quarter growth rate
was enhanced by approximately 2% and the year by approximately 0.5%. While the
additional week added to sales, it also brought a full week's worth of operating
costs; therefore the net earnings impact was negligible.

Analysis of Sales by Business Segments
Consumer Segment
Consumer segment sales in 2004 were $8.3 billion, an increase of 12.1% over
2003, with operational growth accounting for 8.8% of the total growth and 3.3%due to positive currency fluctuations. U.S. Consumer segment sales were $4.2
billion, an increase of 6.5%. International sales were $4.1 billion, an increase
of 18.7%, with 11.5% as a result of operations and 7.2% due to currency
fluctuations over 2003.
Consumer segment sales growth in 2004 was attributable to strong sales
performance in the major franchises including over-the-counter (OTC)
pharmaceutical and nutritional products, Skin Care and Baby & Kids Care.
Over-the-counter pharmaceutical and nutritional products sales were $2.4
billion, an increase of 17.2% over 2003. Overall growth in this franchise
primarily resulted from the rapid increase of SPLENDA No Calorie Sweetener in
the tabletop category. The acquisition of Merck's equity stake in the European
nonprescription pharmaceutical business was also a contributing factor to this
increase, as it added 7.7% growth to the over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and
nutritionals franchise.

In February 2004, the Company announced an agreement with Tate & Lyle
related to the production of sucralose and the SPLENDA brand. This
transaction was completed on April 2, 2004 and resulted in the Company
being responsible for the worldwide sales and marketing of the tabletop
category of SPLENDA Brand Sweetener and Tate & Lyle being responsible
for the manufacturing of sucralose and the marketing of ingredient
sales. This transaction reduced sales growth by 3.1% for the franchise.
The Skin Care franchise sales in 2004 were $2.1 billion, representing a 19.1%
increase over 2003. This was attributable to double-digit sales growth in RoC,
AVEENO, CLEAN & CLEAR and NEUTROGENA brand products. The ADVANCED SOLUTIONS
product line launched in 2004 was a key contributor in the growth of NEUTROGENA.
The Baby & Kids Care franchise grew by 10.5% to $1.4 billion in 2004. Growth in
this franchise was led by the success of the JOHNSON'S SOFTWASH and SOFTLOTION
product lines and the BALMEX brand products acquired in 2003.
Consumer segment sales in 2003 were $7.4 billion, an increase of 13.2%
over 2002, with operational growth accounting for 9.4% of the total
growth, and 3.8% due to a positive currency impact. U.S. sales
increased by 10.1% while international sales increased by 17.0%, with
8.6% due to operational gains and a positive currency impact of 8.4%
over 2002. Consumer segment sales in 2002 were $6.6 billion, an
increase of 3.9% over 2001, with 4.6% of the increase due to
operational growth offset by 0.7% of a negative currency impact. U.S.
sales increased by 4.5% while international sales gains were 3.1%, with
4.6% operational gains offset by a negative currency impact of 1.5%.
Pharmaceutical Segment
Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2004 were $22.1 billion, an increase of
13.4% over 2003, with 10.7% of this change due to operational growth
and the remaining 2.7% increase related to the positive impact of
currency. U.S. Pharmaceutical segment sales increased 12.7% while
international Pharmaceutical segment sales increased 14.8%, which
included 6.4% of operational growth and 8.4% related to the positive
impact of currency.
Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2004 include the benefit from
adjustments related to previously estimated performance-based rebate
allowances in managed care contracts. These adjustments were made based
on a review of actual performance levels as achieved by customers,
compared to expected performance levels. These favorable adjustments
amounted to less than 1.0% of the Pharmaceutical segment's operational
growth in 2004. The vast majority of the impact of this adjustment was
in the hormonal contraceptive franchise.Pharmaceutical segment sales growth reflects the strong performance in
many of the key pharmaceutical products, partially offset by the sales
decline of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) and EPREX (Epoetin alfa), which were
adversely affected by competition. Combined, PROCRIT and EPREX sales
declined 9.9% in 2004 as compared to 2003. PROCRIT sales declined by
12.2% over 2003. The PROCRIT sales decrease was due to lower pricing
and market share, partially offset by market growth. The Company
continues in its efforts to stabilize market share and expand the
market.
A strong growth driver in the Pharmaceutical segment was RISPERDAL
(risperidone), a medication that treats the symptoms of schizophrenia. RISPERDAL
accounted for $3.1 billion in sales in 2004, with continued success of RISPERDAL
CONSTA (risperidone) long-acting injection. REMICADE (infliximab), a novel
monoclonal antibody therapy indicated to treat the symptoms of Crohn's disease
and rheumatoid arthritis, also had strong growth. REMICADE sales were $2.1
billion in 2004, an increase of 24.1% over 2003.
DURAGESIC (fentanyl transdermal system), with its novel delivery system
for the treatment of chronic pain, continued to achieve outstanding
results, growing 27.7% over 2003. The pediatric exclusivity for the
DURAGESIC patent expired in the U.S. in January 2005. The first generic
version of DURAGESIC has been launched. Additionally, an authorized
generic version of DURAGESIC is currently being marketed for the
Company. The Company expects that DURAGESIC sales will decline in 2005.
See Note 18 for further discussion regarding this matter.
TOPAMAX (topiramate), an antiepileptic that was recently approved for
use in the prevention of migraines, had strong growth of 35.2% over
2003. LEVAQUIN (levofloxacin) and FLOXIN (ofloxacin) grew by 12.8% over
2003. During the fiscal fourth quarter, LEVAQUIN oral solution was
approved as a new once a day formulation for the treatment of adults
for currently approved indications and for anthrax prophylaxis.

estradiol), the first contraceptive patch approved by the FDA, and ORTHO
TRI-CYCLEN LO, (norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol) a low dose oral contraceptive.
These sales increases were partially offset by reduced sales of ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN
(norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol), as a result of generic competition in 2004.
There was also strong growth in various other products, including VELCADE
(bortezomib), an oncology treatment; DITROPAN XL (oxybutynin), for the treatment
of overactive bladder; REMINYL (galantamine HBr), a treatment for patients with
mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease; and NATRECOR (nesiritide), a novel agent
approved for congestive heart failure.
CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl), a product for the treatment of attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, sales continued to grow despite the lack of patent
exclusivity in the U.S. At present, the FDA has not approved any generic version
that is substitutable for CONCERTA. Abbreviated New Drug Applications, (ANDAs),for generic versions of CONCERTA are pending and may be approved at any time.
Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2003 were $19.5 billion, an increase of 13.8%
over 2002, with 9.7% of this change due to operational growth and the remaining
4.1% increase related to the positive impact of currency. U.S. Pharmaceutical
segment sales increased 11.3% while international Pharmaceutical segment sales
increased 19.4%, which included 6.0% growth operationally and 13.4% related to
the positive impact of currency. Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2002 were $17.2
billion, an increase of 15.5% over 2001, with 14.8% due to operational growth
and 0.7% due to currency fluctuations. U.S. sales increased by 16.4% while
international sales grew 13.5% over 2001. This included a 2.4% positive impact
of currency and operational growth of 11.1%.
Medical Devices and Diagnostics Segment
Worldwide, the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment achieved sales of $16.9
billion in 2004, representing an increase over the prior year of 13.2%, with
operational growth of 9.0% and a positive impact from currency of 4.2%. U.S.
sales increased 6.9% while international sales increased 20.7%, with 11.4% from
operations and 9.3% from currency.
Strong sales growth in the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment was led by
multiple franchises.
The DePuy franchise reported $3.4 billion in sales, which represents 13.7%
growth over the prior year. Double-digit growth in DePuy's orthopaedic joint
reconstruction unit led the increase for this franchise. Strong performance was
also reported in DePuy's spine unit and Mitek sports medicine products.
The Cordis franchise was a key contributor to the segment results with reported
sales of $3.2 billion, an increase of 18.7% over the prior year. The primary
driver of the sales growth for 2004 was the CYPHER Sirolimus-eluting Stent in
international markets including its launch in Japan. U.S. CYPHER
Sirolimus-eluting Stent sales remained relatively flat as compared to 2003, due
to the entry of a competing product. Biosense Webster and the Endovascular
business unit also contributed to the success of the Cordis franchise, with
continued solid double-digit growth.
In April and July of 2004, the Cordis Cardiology Division of Cordis Corporation
received warning letters from the FDA regarding Good Manufacturing Practice
regulations and Good Clinical Practice regulations. These observations followed
post-approval site inspections completed in 2003 and early 2004, including sites
involved in the production of the CYPHER Sirolimus-eluting Stent. In response to
the warning letters, Cordis has met periodically with the FDA representatives at
the Center and the Districts advising them of the progress being made in
addressing observations raised in the warning letters.
The Ethicon Endo-Surgery franchise reported $2.8 billion of sales in 2004,
representing 10.1% growth over prior year. This growth was mainly driven by
endocutter sales that include products used in performing bariatric procedures
for the treatment of obesity, an important focus area for the franchise. In
2004, Ethicon Endo-Surgery introduced the new ENDOPATH XCEL trocar platform and
the CONTOUR Curved Cutter Stapler, the only curvilinear cutter stapler for
colorectal surgery that conforms to a patient's natural anatomy. Strong
double-digit sales in the Advanced Sterilization Products line was also a key
contributor to the overall sales growth of the Ethicon Endo-Surgery franchise.
The Ethicon worldwide franchise achieved $2.8 billion of sales in 2004,
representing 7.5% growth over prior year. The Ethicon franchise continues to
grow by introducing new products into the marketplace, such as coated VICRYL
(polyglactin 910) Plus, the first product in a new anti-bacterial suture
platform, and MULTIPASS needles, introduced in the second fiscal quarter of
2004.

The LifeScan franchise reported $1.7 billion of sales in 2004, a growth rate of
19.3% over the prior year. The ONETOUCH ULTRA test strip provided strong growth
to the franchise for 2004.
The Vision Care franchise achieved $1.5 billion of sales in 2004, which was a
growth rate of 18.0% over the prior year, led by the continued success of ACUVUE
ADVANCE Brand Contact Lenses with HYDRACLEAR and 1-DAY ACUVUE.
The Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics franchise reported $1.3 billion of sales in 2004,
representing 8.2% growth over the prior year. This growth was mainly driven by
its market penetration of the automated blood typing products, coupled with
continued growth of the ECI product line.
On December 15, 2004, Johnson & Johnson announced the signing of a definitive
agreement to acquire Guidant Corporation (Guidant), a world leader in the
treatment of cardiac and vascular disease, for $25.4 billion in fully diluted
equity value.
The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment achieved sales of $14.9 billion in
2003, representing an increase over the prior year of 18.5% with operational
growth of 12.8% and a positive impact from currency of 5.7%. U.S. sales
increased 15.9% while international sales increased 21.7%, with 9.0% from
operations and 12.7% from currency. In 2002, the Medical Devices and Diagnostics
segment sales were $12.6 billion, representing a total increase of 12.9% over
2001. The 12.9% total increase also represents the operational sales increase
over the prior year, as there was no currency impact. U.S. sales were up 13.0%
and international sales increased 12.8% over the prior year.
Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income
Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income increased to $12.8
billion, or 24.5%, over the $10.3 billion in 2003. The increase in 2003 was
10.9% over the $9.3 billion in 2002. As a percent to sales, consolidated
earnings before provision for taxes on income in 2004 was 27.1%, representing an
increase of 2.5% over the 24.6% in 2003. For 2003, the decline was 1.0% over the
25.6% in 2002, and the improvement in 2002 was 1.2% over 2001. The sections that
follow highlight the significant components of the changes in consolidated
earnings before provision for taxes on income.
Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost
of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent
to sales were as follows:

</TABLE>
In 2004, there was a decrease in the percent to sales of cost of products sold.
This was due to favorable mix, as well as cost improvement initiatives. There
was also a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and
administrative expenses. This was due to the Company's focus on managing
expenses, partially offset by an increase in investment spending across a number
of businesses focused on driving future growth. In 2003, there was no
improvement in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative
expenses and an increase in the percent to sales of cost of products sold. This
was due to the changes in the mix of products with varying cost structures, as
well as the cost of the retirement enhancement program of $95 million expensed
in the fourth quarter of 2003. In 2002, the decreases were attributable to
expense leveraging on sales increases and productivity improvements.
Research and Development: Research activities represent a significant part of
the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the development of new
products, improvement of existing products, technical support of products and
compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of the consumer.Worldwide costs of research activities, excluding the in-process research and
development charges, were as follows:

</TABLE>
Research and development expense as a percent of sales for the Pharmaceutical
segment was 16.4% for 2004, 16.4% for 2003 and 15.7% for 2002. Combined, the
Consumer and Medical Devices and Diagnostics segments averaged 6.2%, 6.7% and
6.6% in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Significant research activities continued in the Pharmaceutical segment,
increasing to $3.6 billion, or 13.6%, over 2003. The compound annual growth rate
was approximately 15.5% for the five-year period since 1999. Johnson & Johnson
Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C., Centocor, Inc., ALZA Corporation,
Tibotec-Virco N.V. and Scios Inc. are primary research centers for the Company.
In-Process Research and Development: In 2004, the Company recorded in-process
research and development (IPR&D) charges of $18 million before tax as a result
of the acquisition of U.S. commercial rights to certain patents and know-how in
the field of sedation and analgesia from Scott Lab, Inc. This charge was
included in the operating profit of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment.
In 2003, the Company recorded IPR&D charges of $918 million before tax related
to the acquisitions of Scios Inc., Link Spine Group, Inc., certain assets of
Orquest, Inc. and 3-Dimensional Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Scios Inc. is a
biopharmaceutical company with a marketed product for cardiovascular disease and
research projects focused on autoimmune diseases. The acquisition of Scios Inc.
accounted for $730 million before tax of the IPR&D charges and was included in
the operating profit of the Pharmaceutical segment. Link Spine Group, Inc. was
acquired
32
<PAGE>
to provide the Company with exclusive worldwide rights to the CHARITE Artificial
Disc for the treatment of spine disorders. The acquisition of Link Spine Group,
Inc. accounted for $170 million before tax of the IPR&D charges and was included
in the operating profit of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment. Orquest,
Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on developing biologically-based
implants for orthopaedic spine surgery. The acquisition of certain assets of
Orquest, Inc. accounted for $11 million before tax of the IPR&D charges and was
included in the operating profit of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment.
3-Dimensional Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a company with a technology platform
focused on the discovery and development of potential new drugs in early stage
development for inflammation. The acquisition of 3-Dimensional Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. accounted for $7 million before tax of the IPR&D charges and was included
in the operating profit of the Pharmaceutical segment.
In 2002, the Company recorded IPR&D charges of $189 million before tax related
to the acquisitions of Tibotec-Virco N.V., a privately-held biopharmaceutical
company focused on developing anti-viral treatments, and Obtech Medical AG, a
privately held company that markets an adjustable gastric band for the treatment
of morbid obesity. IPR&D of $150 million and $39 million was included in the
Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics segments, respectively.
Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense includes gains and losses
related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities
held by Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation, gains and losses on the
disposal of fixed assets, currency gains and losses, minority interests,
litigation settlement (income) expense and royalty income. The change in net
other (income) expense from 2003 to 2004 was an increase in expense of $400
million.
For 2004, the other expense balance of $15 million included several expense
items, none of which were individually significant, offset by royalty income.
In 2003, other income of $385 million included a favorable ruling from a stent
patent settlement of $230 million. This amount was received during the fourth
quarter of 2003 and was included in the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment
operating profit. Also included in the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment
operating profit was the gain on the sale of various product lines that were no
longer compatible with this segment's strategic goals. Other (income) expensefor 2003 also included the recovery of a $40 million loan, included in the
Pharmaceutical segment operating profit.
In 2002, other expense of $294 million included the impact of the Amgen
arbitration settlement expense and the gain on the sale of the ORTHO PREFEST
product line. On October 18, 2002, an arbitrator in Chicago denied an effort by
Amgen, Inc. to terminate the 1985 license agreement under which Ortho Biotech
Inc. obtained exclusive U.S. rights to Amgen-developed erythropoetin (EPO) for
all indications outside of kidney dialysis. In his decision, the arbitrator
found that sales had been made into markets where Amgen had retained exclusive
rights, but that they did not warrant the extraordinary remedy of terminating
the contract. Instead, he found that Amgen could be adequately compensated with
monetary damages. The arbitrator awarded $150 million in damages. On January 24,
2003, the arbitrator ruled that Amgen was the "prevailing party" in this
arbitration, entitling it to an award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
The Company expensed $85 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 in connection
with this claim. These charges were included in the Pharmaceutical segment
operating profit.

[graph]
Consumer Segment: Consumer segment operating profit in 2004 increased 8.7% over
the previous year. As a percent to sales, 2004 experienced a decrease of 0.5%
from 2003, primarily due to additional investment in consumer promotions and
advertising in the over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and nutritionals franchises.
Operating profit for the Consumer segment as a percent to sales in 2003 remained
unchanged from 2002 at 18.7%. Expense leveraging due to increased sales volumes
was offset by costs incurred for manufacturing programs to gain future
efficiencies and advertising.
Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2004, Pharmaceutical segment operating profit
increased 29.0% and reflects operating profit as a percent to sales improvement
of 4.2% over 2003 to 34.4%. This change is primarily due to the impact of $737
million of IPR&D expenses in 2003. Additionally, Pharmaceutical segment
33
<PAGE>
leveraging is the result of selling and marketing related cost improvements. In
2003, operating profit for the Pharmaceutical segment as a percent to sales was
30.2%,reflecting a decline of 3.5% from 2002 due to the IPR&D charges related to
acquisitions as previously noted. Additionally, operating profit was impacted by
the sales decline of PROCRIT and EPREX, and increased consumer promotional
spending for new products and line extensions.
Medical Devices and Diagnostics Segment: In 2004, the Medical Devices and
Diagnostics segment operating profit increased 21.4%. The increase over the
prior year was achieved through improved gross margins, resulting from cost
reduction programs and product mix, and the impact of $181 million of IPR&D
expenses related to acquisitions in 2003. In 2003, operating profit for the
Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment as a percent to sales was 22.6%,
reflecting an improvement of 2.8% over 2002.Interest (Income) Expense: Interest income in 2004 increased by $18 million due
primarily to a higher cash balance. The cash and marketable securities combined
balance at the end of 2004 was $12.9 billion and averaged $11.3 billion, which
is significantly higher than the $8.6 billion average cash balance in 2003.
Interest expense in 2004 decreased by $20 million as compared to 2003 primarily
due to a decrease in the average debt balance, from $5.0 billion in 2003 to $3.5
billion in 2004.
Provision For Taxes On Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 33.7%
in 2004, 30.2% in 2003 and 29.0% in 2002. The increase in the effective tax rate
in 2004 was primarily due to the $789 million tax cost on the intended
repatriation of undistributed international earnings associated with the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which added 6.1% to the effective income tax
rate. The increase in 2003 and 2002 was primarily due to the Company's
non-deductible IPR&D charges and the increase in income subject to tax in the
U.S. Refer to Note 8 for additional information.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows
Cash generated from operations and selected borrowings provide the major sources
of funds for the growth of the business, including working capital, capital
expenditures and acquisitions. Other uses of cash include share repurchases,
dividends and debt repayments.
In 2004, cash flow from operations was $11.1 billion, an increase of $0.5
billion over 2003. The increase in cash generated from operations was a result
of a net income increase of $0.4 billion, net of the non-cash impact of IPR&D
charges.
Net cash used by investing activities decreased by $2.2 billion in 2004 due to a
decrease in acquisition activity. For a more detailed discussion on mergers and
acquisitions, see Note 17.
Net cash used by financing activities increased by $1.3 billion in 2004
primarily due to an increase in the net repayment of debt and increased
dividends.
Cash and current marketable securities were $12.9 billion at the end of 2004 as
compared with $9.5 billion at the end of 2003.
[graph]
Cash generated from operations amounted to $10.6 billion in 2003, which was $2.4
billion more than the cash generated from operations in 2002 of $8.2 billion.
Major factors contributing to the increase were an increase in net income of
$1.3 billion, net of the non-cash impact of IPR&D charges, an increase in the
change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $0.8 billion, a decrease
in the pension funding from 2002 of $0.5 billion and changes to deferred taxes
of $0.6 billion.
Financing and Market Risk
The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange
rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign
exchange contracts to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and
liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency product costs. Gains or losses
on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying
transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from January 2, 2005 market
rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company's forward contracts by
$258 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. dollar from the January
2, 2005 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company's
forward contracts by $315 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the
forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying
transaction and, therefore, would have no impact on future earnings and cash
flows.
The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and
the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering
into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign
interest rates on the Company's interest rate sensitive financial instruments
would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company's swap
contracts by approximately $64 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the
gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the
underlying assets and liabilities and therefore would have no impact on future
cash flows.
The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts withparties that have at least an "A" (or equivalent) credit rating. The
counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and the
Company does not have significant exposure to any one counterparty. Management
believes the risk of loss related to non-performance by a counterparty is
remote.

<PAGE>
Total unused credit available to the Company approximates $3.9 billion,
including $1.5 billion of credit commitments, of which $0.75 billion expire
September 29, 2005 and $0.75 billion that expire September 30, 2009. Also,
included are $0.9 billion of uncommitted lines with various banks worldwide that
expire during 2005.
Total borrowings at the end of 2004 and 2003 were $2.8 billion and $4.1 billion,
respectively. Total debt represented 8.2% of total capital (shareholders' equity
and total debt) in 2004 and 13.2% of total capital in 2003. Shareholders' equity
per share at the end of 2004 was $10.71 compared with $9.05 at year-end 2003, an
increase of 18.3%. On November 1, 2004 the Company exercised its right to redeem
all of its $300 million aggregate principal amount of 8.72% Debentures due in
2024. The redemption price was 104.360% of the principal amount or $1,043.36 per
$1,000 principal amount of Debentures, with accrued interest to the date of
redemption. At January 2, 2005, there were no material cash commitments. Johnson
& Johnson continues to be one of a few industrial companies with a Triple A
credit rating. A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 6.
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
The Company has long-term contractual obligations, primarily lease, debt
obligations and unfunded retirement plans, with no other significant
obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from
operations. The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations
and their aggregate maturities as of January 2, 2005 (see Notes 4, 6 and 13 for

$5.0 billion with no time limit on this program. This program was completed on
August 1, 2002, with 83.6 million shares repurchased. In addition, the Company
has an annual program to repurchase shares for use in employee stock and
incentive plans.
The Company increased its dividend in 2004 for the 42nd consecutive year. Cash
dividends paid were $1.095 per share in 2004, compared with dividends of $0.925
per share in 2003 and $0.795 per share in 2002. The dividends were distributed

$0.285 per share, paid on March 8, 2005, to shareholders of record as ofFebruary 15, 2005. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying
regular cash dividends.
Other Information
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management's discussion and analysis on results of operations and financial
condition are based on the Company's consolidated financial statements that have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues,
expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may
or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the
understanding of certain key accounting policies is essential in achieving more
insight into the Company's operating results and financial condition. These key
accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self
insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets and assumptions used to
determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and
accounting for stock options.
Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when
goods are shipped or delivered and title and risk of loss pass to the customer.
Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons,
product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in
sales in the same period the related sales are recorded.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct,
indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including
prices charged by competitors. Rebates, the largest being the Medicaid rebate
provision, are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend
analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The
Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily
through the analysis of wholesaler and other third party sell-through and market
research data, as well as internally generated information.
Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historical sales and
returns information, analysis of recent wholesale purchase information,
consideration of stocking levels at wholesalers and forecasted demand amounts.
Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating,
competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and
analyzed as part of the accounting for accruals.
The Company also recognizes service revenue that is received for co-promotion
of certain products. For all years presented, service revenues were less than 2%
of total revenues and are included in sales to customers.
Income Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable
in the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP
accounting and U.S. tax reporting that are recorded as deferred tax assets or
liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on
current tax regulations and rates. Changes in tax laws and
35
<PAGE>
rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.
Management believes that changes in these estimates would not result in a
material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
The Company has determined that it will repatriate $10.8 billion of
undistributed international earnings in 2005 in accordance with the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and has recorded a tax charge of $789 million during
the fourth quarter of 2004. (This tax charge may be reduced by approximately
$225 million, due to technical corrections legislation, expected to be
considered by Congress in 2005.) The legislation was passed during the fourth
quarter of 2004 and permits U.S. corporations to repatriate earnings of foreign
subsidiaries at a special one-time favorable effective tax rate. At January 2,
2005 and December 28, 2003, the cumulative amount of undistributed international
earnings were approximately $18.6 billion and $14.8 billion, respectively. The
Company intends to continue to reinvest its undistributed international earnings
to expand its international operations; therefore, no U.S. tax expense has been
recorded to cover the undistributed portion not intended for repatriation.
Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various
contingencies including legal proceedings and product liability cases as these
arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management's
judgment as to the probability of losses, opinions of legal counsel and, whereapplicable, actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records
insurance receivable amounts from third party insurers based on the probability
of recovery. As appropriate, reserves against these receivables are recorded for
estimated amounts that may not be collected from third party insurers.
Long-Lived And Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes in economic
conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in
evaluating the value of the Company's property, plant and equipment, goodwill
and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time,
it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges. In
2004, certain tangible and intangible assets were written down to fair value
with the resulting charge recorded in cost of products sold.
Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension
plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity
plans, that cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions
for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, expected salary increases
and health care cost trend rates. See Note 13 for further detail on these rates
and the effect a rate change would have on the Company's results of operations.
Stock Options: The Company has elected to use Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), that does not
require compensation costs related to stock options to be charged against net
income, as all options granted under the various stock options plans had an
exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock at grant
date. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 148 Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123, requires pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per
share determined as if the fair value method of accounting for stock options had
been applied in measuring compensation cost. See Notes 1 and 10 for further
information regarding stock options.
New Accounting Standards
In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with
Exit or Disposal Activities, which is effective for exit or disposal activities
that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company's adoption of SFAS No.
146 did not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash
flows or financial position.
In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45),
Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB
Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. FIN
45 clarifies the requirements of FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for
Contingencies, relating to the guarantor's accounting for and disclosure of the
issuance of certain types of guarantees. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45
were effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods that end
after December 15, 2002. The provisions for initial recognition and measurement
were effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that were issued or
modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of the guarantor's year-end. FIN
45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the entity must recognize a
liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee.
The Company's adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material effect on the Company's
results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities - an interpretation of ARB No. 51, and in December 2003, issued a
revised FIN 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - an
interpretation of ARB No. 51, both of which address consolidation of variable
interest entities. In addition, the FASB issued various FASB Staff Positions
(FSP) on this topic in December 2003. FIN 46 expands the criteria for
consideration in determining whether a variable interest entity should be
consolidated by a business entity, and requires existing unconsolidated variable
interest entities (which include, but are not limited to, Special Purpose
Entities, or SPEs) to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the
entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved. This
interpretation was immediately applicable to variable interest entities created
after January 31, 2003. The adoption of this portion of FIN 46 has not had a
material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position. FIN 46 was applicable in 2004 to variable interest entities in which
an enterprise holds a variable interest that was acquired before February 1,
2003. The adoption of this portion of FIN 46 did not have a material effect on
the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.
In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which is effective for contracts
entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. This Statement amends and
clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts36
<PAGE>
and for hedging activities. The Company's adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have
a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or
financial position.
In December 2003, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 106-1, Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003, which is effective for interim or annual financial
statements of fiscal years ending after December 7, 2003. The Company elected to
defer adoption of FSP FAS No. 106-1 until authoritative guidance was issued, as
allowed by the Standard. This guidance was issued in by the FASB in May 2004 via
FSP FAS No. 106-2. The Company adopted FSP FAS No. 106-1 and 106-2 in the fiscal
third quarter of 2004. This adoption did not have a material effect on the
Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In July 2004, the FASB ratified the EITF consensus on Issue 02-14, Whether an
Investor should apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments other than
Common Stock, which is effective for the fourth quarter of 2004. This consensus
clarifies that when an investor has the ability to exercise significant
influence over the operating and financial policies of an investee, the equity
method of accounting should be applied only when the investor has an investment
in common stock and/or an investment that is in-substance common stock. The
adoption of this consensus did not have a material effect on the Company's
results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In October 2004, the FASB ratified the EITF consensus on Issue 04-1, Accounting
for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination.
This consensus describes the accounting for the settlement of preexisting
relationships and the re-acquisition of certain rights in a business
combination. This consensus was effective for the fourth quarter of 2004 and was
adopted by the Company in that quarter. This adoption did not have a material
effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position,
but may impact future transactions.
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of
ARB No. 43. This statement clarifies the accounting for idle capacity expense,
freight, handling costs, and wasted material and is effective for the third
quarter of 2005. The Company believes the adoption of this statement will not
have a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. This
statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an
entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services. It focuses
primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee
services in share-based payment transactions (employee stock options). The
statement requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in
exchange for an award of equity instruments (such as employee stock options) at
fair value on the grant date. That cost will be recognized over the period
during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the
award (the requisite service period). The effective date of this statement is
the fiscal third quarter of 2005. The Company is still considering transition
methods under this standard. The Company currently estimates the annualized cost
associated with expensing stock options to be approximately $0.12 per share in
2005. Refer to Note 1 for more details. The Company is proposing a new long-term
incentive plan including various forms of stock compensation, such as stock
options and restricted stock.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non-monetary
Assets, an amendment of APB 29. This statement clarifies that all non-monetary
transactions that have commercial substance should be recorded at fair value and
is effective for the first quarter of 2005. The Company believes the adoption of
this statement will not have a material effect on its results of operations,
cash flows or financial position.
In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 109-1 and FAS 109-2, which address
accounting and disclosure requirements related to certain provisions of the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. These requirements were effective
immediately. The Company has adopted these provisions, the impact of which is
more fully described in Note 1 and 8.
Economic and Market Factors
Johnson & Johnson is aware that its products are used in an environment where,
for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed
concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns,
Johnson & Johnson has a long standing policy of pricing products responsibly.
For the period 1994-2004, in the United States, the weighted average compoundannual growth rate of Johnson & Johnson net price increases for health care
products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional
products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).
Inflation rates, even though moderate in many parts of the world during 2004,
continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way
companies operate. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to
maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity
improvements and periodic price increases. The Company faces various worldwide
health care changes that may result in pricing pressures that include health
care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions
and reimbursement.
The Company also operates in an environment which has become increasingly
hostile to intellectual property rights. Generic drug firms have filed
Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking to market generic forms of most of the
Company's key pharmaceutical products, prior to expiration of the applicable
patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in
defending a lawsuit resulting from an Abbreviated New Drug Application filing,
the generic firms will then introduce generic versions of the product at issue,
resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue loss for
that product. For further information see the discussion on "Litigation Against
Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications" in Note 18.

</TABLE>
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in numerous product liability cases in the United
States, many of which concern adverse reactions to drugs and medical devices.
The damages claimed are substantial, and while the Company is confident of the
adequacy of the warnings and instructions for use which accompany such products,
it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. However, the
Company believes that if any liability results from such cases, it will be
substantially covered by existing amounts accrued in the Company's balance sheet
under its self-insurance program and by third party product liability insurance.
See Note 18 for further information regarding legal proceedings.
Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results
This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and anticipate
results based on management's plans that are subject to uncertainty.
Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words like "plans,"
"expects," "will," "anticipates," "estimates" and other words of similar meaning
in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations,
financial performance, the Company's strategy for growth, product development,
regulatory approval, market position and expenditures.
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events.
The Company cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be
accurate, although the Company believes that it has been reasonable in its
expectations and assumptions. Investors should realize that if underlying
assumptions prove inaccurate or that unknown risks or uncertainties materialize,
actual results could vary materially from the Company's expectations and
projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on
any forward-looking statements. The Company assumes no obligation to update any
forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or
developments.Risks and uncertainties include general industry conditions and competition;
economic conditions, such as interest rate and currency exchange rate
fluctuations; technological advances, new products and patents attained by
competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining
regulatory approvals; challenges to patents; U.S. and foreign health care
reforms and governmental laws and regulations; trends toward health care cost
containment; increased scrutiny of the health care industry by government
agencies; product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls or
regulatory action.
The Company's report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 2, 2005 contains,
as an Exhibit, a discussion of additional factors that could cause actual
results to differ from expectations. The Company notes these factors as
permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson
and subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.
Description of the Company and Business Segments
The Company and its subsidiaries have approximately 109,900 employees worldwide
engaged in the manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health
care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the
world and its primary focus has been in products related to human health and
well-being.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with
Exit or Disposal Activities, which is effective for exit or disposal activities
that are initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company's adoption of SFAS No.
146 did not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cashflows or financial position.
In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45),
Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an
interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and Rescission of
FASB Interpretation No. 34. FIN 45 clarifies the requirements of FASB
Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to the
guarantor's accounting for and disclosure of the issuance of certain
types of guarantees. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are
effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods that
end after December 15, 2002. The provisions for initial recognition
and measurement were effective on a prospective basis for guarantees
that were issued or modified after December 31, 2002, irrespective of
the guarantor's year-end. FIN 45 requires that upon issuance of a
guarantee, the entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of
the obligation it assumes under that guarantee. The Company's adoption
of FIN 45 did not have a material effect on the Company's results of
operations, cash flows or financial position.
In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities - an interpretation of ARB No. 51, and in December
2003, issued a revised FIN 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities - an interpretation of ARB No. 51, both of which address
consolidation of variable interest entities. In addition, the FASB
issued various FASB Staff Positions (FSP) on this topic in December
2003. FIN 46 expands the criteria for consideration in determining
whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated by a business
entity, and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities
(which include, but are not limited to, Special Purpose Entities, or SPEs)
to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not
effectively disperse risks among parties involved. This interpretation was
immediately applicable to variable interest entities created after January
31, 2003. The adoption of this portion of FIN 46 has not had a material
effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position. FIN 46 was applicable in 2004 to variable interest entities in
which an enterprise holds a variable interest that was acquired before
February 1, 2003. The adoption of this portion of FIN 46 did not have a
material effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial
position of the Company.
In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133
on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which is effective for
contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. This Statement
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. The Company's adoption of SFAS No.
149 did not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations,
cash flows or financial position.
In December 2003, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 106-1, Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which is effective for interim
or annual financial statements of fiscal years ending after December 7,
2003. The Company elected to defer adoption of FSP FAS No. 106-1 until
authoritative guidance was issued, as allowed by the Standard. This guidance
was issued in by the FASB in May 2004 via FSP FAS No. 106-2. The Company
adopted FSP FAS No. 106-1 and 106-2 in the fiscal third quarter of 2004.
This adoption did not have a material effect on the Company's results of
operations, cash flows or financial position.
In July 2004, the FASB ratified the EITF consensus on Issue 02-14,
Whether an Investor should apply the Equity Method of Accounting to
Investments other than Common Stock, which is effective for the fourth
quarter of 2004. This consensus clarifies that when an investor has the
ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and
financial policies of an investee, the equity method of accounting
should be applied only when the investor has an investment in common
stock and/or an investment that is in-substance common stock. The
adoption of this consensus did not have a material effect on the
Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In October 2004, the FASB ratified the EITF consensus on Issue 04-1,
Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between the Parties to a
Business Combination. This consensus describes the accounting for the
settlement of preexisting relationships and the re-acquisition of
certain rights in a business combination. This consensus was effective
for the fourth quarter of 2004 and was adopted by the Company in that
quarter. This adoption did not have a material effect on the Company's
results of operations, cash flows or financial position, but may impact
future transactions.In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, an
amendment of ARB No. 43. This statement clarifies the accounting for
idle capacity expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material
and is effective for the third quarter of 2005. The Company believes the
adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on its
results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment.
This statement establishes standards for the accounting for
transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for
goods and services. It focuses primarily on accounting for transactions
in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment
transactions (employee stock options). The statement requires the
measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for
an award of equity instruments (such as employee stock options)
43
<PAGE>
at fair value on the grant date. That cost will be recognized over the period
during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the
award (the requisite service period). The effective date of this statement is
the fiscal third quarter of 2005. The Company is still considering transition
methods under this standard. The Company currently estimates the annualized cost
associated with expensing stock options to be approximately $0.12 per share in
2005. The Company is proposing a new long-term incentive plan including various
forms of stock compensation, such as stock options and restricted stock.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Non-
monetary Assets, an amendment of APB 29. This statement clarifies that
all non-monetary transactions that have commercial substance should be
recorded at fair value and is effective for the first quarter of 2005.
The Company believes the adoption of this statement will not have a
material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 109-1 and FAS 109-2,
which address accounting and disclosure requirements related to certain
provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. These requirements
were effective immediately. The Company has adopted these provisions, the
impact of which is described in Note 1 and Note 8.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers securities with maturities of three months or less, when
purchased, to be cash equivalents.
Investments
Short-term marketable securities are carried at cost, which approximates fair
value. Long-term debt securities that the Company has the ability and intent to
hold until maturity are carried at amortized cost, which also approximates fair
value. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated
fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. Management determines the appropriate
classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of
purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The
Company periodically reviews its investments in non-marketable equity securities
for impairment and adjusts these investments to their fair value when a decline
in market value is deemed to be other than temporary.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the
straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the
assets:
Building and building equipment 20-40 years
Land and leasehold improvements 10-20 years
Machinery and equipment 2-13 years
The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs,
included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with developing
or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are
amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range
from 3 to 5 years.
The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using
undiscounted cash flows. When necessary, charges for impairments of long-livedassets are recorded for the amount by which the present value of future cash
flows is less than the carrying value of these assets.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the goods are shipped or
delivered and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for
certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns
and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same
period the related sales are recorded.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with
direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market
conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, the largest
being the Medicaid rebate provision, are estimated based on sales terms,
historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in
the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for
products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of
wholesaler and other third party sell-through and market research data,
as well as internally generated information.
Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historical sales and
returns information, analysis of recent wholesale purchase information,
consideration of stocking levels at wholesalers and forecasted demand amounts.
Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating,
competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and
analyzed as part of the accounting for accruals. The Company also recognizes
service revenue that is received for co-promotion of certain products in sales
to customers.
Shipping and Handling
Shipping and handling costs incurred were $679 million, $604 million and $518
million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and are included in selling,
marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for
shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods
presented.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined by the
first-in, first-out method.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2002 in accordance with SFAS No. 142,
the Company discontinued the amortization relating to all existing goodwill and
indefinite lived intangible assets, which are non-amortizable. SFAS No. 142
requires that goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets be assessed
annually for impairment. The Company completed the annual impairment test for
2004 in the fiscal fourth quarter and no impairment was determined. Future
impairment tests will be performed in the fiscal fourth quarter, annually.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized
over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted
by economic conditions. See Note 7 for further details on Intangible Assets.
44
<PAGE>
Financial Instruments
The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for
Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, and SFAS No. 149,
Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
collectively referred to as SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 133 requires that all
derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes
in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or
other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as
part of a hedge transaction, and if so, what type of hedge transaction.
The Company uses forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the
variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate
changes of future intercompany product and third party purchases of raw
materials denominated in foreign currency. The Company also uses currency swaps
to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both of these types of
derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company uses
forward exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency
assets and liabilities. These forward exchange contracts are not designated as
hedges and, therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives arerecognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the
related foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date into the
derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly
effective. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a
cash flow hedge and is highly effective are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are
then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.
Fair value of a forward exchange contract represents the present value of the
change in forward exchange rates times the notional amount of the derivative.
The fair value of a currency swap contract is determined by discounting to the
present all future cash flows of the currencies to be exchanged at interest
rates prevailing in the market for the periods the currency exchanges are due
and expressing the result in U.S. dollars at the current spot foreign currency
exchange rate.
On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to
be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items. If
and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge
accounting is discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in
current period earnings, and was insignificant in 2004.
The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives.
The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge
transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are:
(1) minimize foreign currency exposure's impact on the Company's financial
performance; (2) protect the Company's cash flow from adverse movements in
foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments;
and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions.
Product Liability
Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis,
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the
liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. The
accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available.
Receivables for insurance recoveries related to product liability claims are
recorded on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a recovery will be
realized.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Upfront and
milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and
development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of
regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory
approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the
related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other
intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.
Advertising
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are
included in the selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising
expenses worldwide, which are comprised of television, radio, print media and
Internet advertising, were $1.9 billion in 2004, $1.7 billion in 2003 and $1.5
billion in 2002.
Income Taxes
The Company has determined that it will repatriate $10.8 billion of
undistributed international earnings in 2005 in accordance with the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and has recorded a tax charge of $789 million during
the fourth quarter of 2004. (This tax charge may be reduced by approximately
$225 million, due to technical corrections legislation, expected to be
considered by Congress in 2005.) The legislation was passed during the fourth
quarter of 2004 and permits U.S. corporations to repatriate earnings of foreign
subsidiaries at a special one-time favorable effective tax rate. At January 2,
2005 and December 28, 2003, the cumulative amount of undistributed international
earnings were approximately $18.6 billion and $14.8 billion, respectively. The
Company intends to continue to reinvest its undistributed international earnings
to expand its international operations; therefore, no U.S. tax expense has been
recorded to cover the undistributed portion not intended for repatriation.
Deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences of temporary
differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates, applicable to future
years, to differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of
existing assets and liabilities.
Net Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could
occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the
treasury stock method.
45
<PAGE>
Stock Options
At January 2, 2005, the Company had 20 stock-based employee compensation plans
that are described in Note 10. The Company accounts for those plans under the
recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principle Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and its related
Interpretations. Compensation costs are not recorded in net income for stock
options as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to
the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.
As required by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -
Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123, the
following table shows the estimated effect on net income and earnings per share
if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provision of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used
when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product
liabilities, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and
asset and liability valuations. For instance, in determining annual pension and
post-employment benefit costs, the Company estimates the rate of return on plan
assets, and the cost of future health care benefits. Actual results may or may
not differ from those estimates.
Annual Closing Date
The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year which ends on the Sunday
nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists
of 52 weeks, but every five or six years, the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks,
as was the case in 2004.
Reclassification
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year
presentation.

was $136 million, $108 million and $98 million, respectively.
Depreciation expense, including the amortization of capitalized interest in
2004, 2003 and 2002 was $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion,
respectively.
Upon retirement or other disposal of fixed assets, the cost and related amount
of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and
accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between
the net asset value and the proceeds is recorded in earnings.
4 Rental Expense and Lease Commitments
Rentals of space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and office and data
processing equipment under operating leases were approximately $254 million in
2004, $279 million in 2003 and $298 million in 2002.

The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks
worldwide. Total unused credit available to the Company approximates $3.9
billion, including $1.5 billion of credit commitments, of which $0.75 billion
expire September 29, 2005 and $0.75 billion expire September 30, 2009. Also
included, are $0.9 billion of uncommitted lines with various banks worldwide
that expire during 2005. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line
agreements is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London
Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under
the agreement are not material.
The Company filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that became effective January 21, 2004, which enables the Company to
issue up to $1.985 billion in debt securities and warrants for the purchase of
debt securities. No debt was issued off the shelf during 2004 and the full
amount remained available as of January 2, 2005.
In August 2002, Scios Inc. issued in a private offering $150 million of 5.5%
Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009; interest payable semi-annually, on
February 15 and August 15. The Notes were convertible at the option of the
holder at any time prior to redemption, repurchase or maturity at a conversion
price of $39.30. Following the acquisition by Johnson & Johnson in April 2003,
each $1,000 in principal amount of the notes became convertible into the right
to receive $1,145.04 in cash without interest. Semi-annual interest remains
payable until conversion, repurchase or maturity. At January 2, 2005 the book
value of these Notes approximates fair value.
On July 28, 2000, ALZA Corporation completed a private offering of 3% Zero
Coupon Convertible Subordinated Debentures, which were issued at a price of
$551.26 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. At January 2, 2005 the
outstanding 3% Debentures had a total principal amount at maturity of $890.8
million with a yield to maturity of 3% per annum, computed on a semiannual bond
equivalent basis. There are no periodic interest payments. Under the terms of
the 3% Debentures, holders are entitled to convert their Debentures into
approximately 15.0 million shares of Johnson & Johnson stock at a price of
$40.102 per share. Approximately 2.7 million shares have been issued as of
January 2, 2005, due to voluntary conversions by note holders. At the option of
the holder, the 3% Debentures may be repurchased by the Company on July 28, 2008
or 2013, at a purchase price equal to the issue price plus accreted original
issue discount to such purchase date. The Company, at its option, may elect to
deliver either Johnson & Johnson common stock or cash, or a combination of stock
and cash, in the event of repurchase of the 3% Debentures. The Company, at its
option, may also redeem any or all of the 3% Debentures after July 28, 2003 atthe issue price plus accreted original issue discount. At January 2, 2005, and
December 28, 2003, the fair value based on quoted market value of the 3%
Debentures was $780.5 million and $712.3 million, respectively.
On November 1, 2004 the Company exercised its right to redeem all of its $300
million aggregate principal amount of 8.72% Debentures due in 2024. The
redemption price was 104.360% of the principal amount or $1,043.36 per $1,000
principal amount of Debentures, with accrued interest to the date of redemption.
Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt amounted to $280
million at the end of 2004, principally local borrowing by international
subsidiaries.

down to fair value during 2004 with the resulting charge included in
amortization expense. The estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding
years approximates $550 million before tax, per year. Substantially all of the
amortization expense is included in cost of products sold.

2003 and 2002, to the Company's effective tax rate is as follows:

</TABLE>
During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company had subsidiaries operating in Puerto
Rico under various tax incentive grants. In addition, the Company had
subsidiaries manufacturing in Ireland under an incentive tax rate. The American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004 tax legislation, permits U.S. corporations to
repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries at a special one-time favorable
effective federal tax rate versus 35%, before consideration of foreign taxes
paid. The Company has determined that it will repatriate approximately $10.8
billion. The Company accrued $789 million for federal and state taxes
attributable to the repatriation of earnings. (This tax charge may be reduced by
approximately $225 million, due to technical corrections legislation, expected
to be considered by Congress in 2005.) The increase in the 2004 worldwide
effective tax rate was primarily due to the repatriation of foreign earnings
under this legislation, which added 6.1% to the 2004 effective tax rate.

9 International Currency Translation
For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. dollar currencies, the
Company has determined that the local currencies of its international
subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary
economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates
of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial
portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency.
In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are
recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. This equity
account includes the results of translating all balance sheet assets and
liabilities at current exchange rates, except for those located in highly
inflationary economies that are reflected in operating results.
An analysis of the changes during 2004 and 2003 for foreign currency translation
adjustments is included in Note 12.
Net currency transaction and translation gains and losses included in other
expense were losses of $38 million, $22 million and $29 million in 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively.
10 Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements
At January 2, 2005, the Company had 20 stock-based compensation plans. Under the
2000 Stock Option Plan, the Company may grant options to its employees for up to
1.6% of the issued shares of the Company's Common Stock plus the number of
shares available from the previous year that were not issued, as well as shares
issued under the Plan that expired or terminated without being exercised. The
shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 1991, 1995 and 2000
Stock Option Plans, the 1997 Non-Employee Director's Plan and the Cordis,
Biosense, Gynecare, Centocor, Innovasive Devices, ALZA, Inverness and Scios
Stock Option Plans. During 2004, no options were granted under any of these
plans except the 2000 Stock Option Plan.
Stock options expire 10 years from the date they are granted and vest over
service periods that range from one to five years. All options are granted at
current market price on the date of grant. Shares available under the 2000 Stock
Option Plan for future grants are based on 1.6% of the issued shares each year,
and 49.9 million shares could be granted each year during the years 2000 through
2005 in addition to any other available shares as described above. Shares
available for future grants under the 2000 plan were 83.3 million at the end of
2004.
A summary of the status of the Company's stock option plans as of January 2,
2005, December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, and changes during the years
ending on those dates are presented below:

13 Pensions and Other Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined
benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most
employees worldwide. The Company also provides postretirement benefits,
primarily health care, to all U.S. retired employees and their dependents.
Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs for
which the cost to the Company is not significant.
Retirement plan benefits are primarily based on the employee's compensation
during the last three to five years before retirement and the number of years of
service. International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited
with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts or reserves are
provided.
The Company does not fund retiree health care benefits in advance and has the
right to modify these plans in the future.
The Company uses the date of its consolidated financial statements (January 2,
2005 and December 28, 2003, respectively) as the measurement date for all U.S.
and international retirement and other benefit plans.
Net periodic benefit cost for the Company's defined benefit retirement plans and
other benefit plans for 2004, 2003 and 2002 include the following components:<TABLE>

</TABLE>
The net periodic benefit cost attributable to U.S. retirement plans was $329
million in 2004, $309 million in 2003 and $61 million in 2002.
During 2003, the Company offered a voluntary retirement program with enhanced
benefits called the Retirement Enhancement Program (REP) to eligible U.S.
regular, full-time employees who have attained age 55 with at least 10 years of
pension credited service by June 30, 2004. The program enhancements included the
elimination of the early retirement reduction for pension benefit purposes
(normally 4% per year prior to age 62) and a special termination benefit (one
week of pay per year of credited service). The program resulted in a one-time
increase in U.S. pension expense of $95 million in 2003 to reflect the value of
the retirement enhancement.
The weighted-average assumptions in the following table represent the rates used
to develop the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligation for the
year listed and also the net periodic benefit cost for the following year.

Strategic asset allocations are determined by country, based on the nature of
the liabilities and considering the demographic composition of the plan
participants (average age, years of service and active versus retiree status).
The Company's plans are considered non-mature plans and the long-term strategic
asset allocations are consistent with these types of plans. Emphasis is placed
on diversifying equities on a broad basis combined with currency matching of the
fixed income assets.

The Company is not expected to have to fund its U.S. retirement plans in 2005 in
order to meet minimum statutory funding requirements. International plans will
be funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary
contributions will be made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term
obligations of the plans. In certain countries other than the United States, the
funding of pension plans is not a common practice as funding provides no
economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans which are
not funded.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all U.S. and international defined
benefit retirement plans was $7,488 million and $6,475 million at January 2,
2005 and December 28, 2003, respectively.
A minimum pension liability adjustment is required when the actuarial present
value of the accumulated benefits obligation (ABO) exceeds the fair value of
plan assets and accrued pension liabilities. The minimum pension liabilities
(intangible assets and accumulated comprehensive income) in 2004 and 2003 of
$396 million and $93 million, respectively, relate primarily to plans outside of
the U.S. The increase in the minimum liability included in comprehensive income
was $282 million and $31 million in 2004 and 2003,respectively.
Plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets consist of

On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 was enacted that introduces a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare as well as a subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care
benefit plans. The Company's prescription plan is "actuarially equivalent" to
the Medicare Part D Coverage due to the fact that at all levels of annual claim
amounts, the Plan provides a greater reimbursement than the Medicare benefit.
There is no change in estimated participation rates or per capita claims costs
as a result of the Act. The Company has recognized the effect of the subsidy on
a prospective basis from June 28, 2004. The recognition reduces before-tax and
after-tax expense by $10 million and the APBO by $131 million.

included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $150 million after-tax.
For additional information, see Note 12. The Company expects that substantially
all of this amount will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as
a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The amount
ultimately realized in earnings will differ as foreign exchange rates change.
Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at
maturity of the derivative. Transactions with third parties will cause the
amount in accumulated other comprehensive income to affect net earnings. The
maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging is 18 months.
For the year ended January 2, 2005, the net impact of the hedges'
ineffectiveness to the Company's financial statements was insignificant. The
Company has recorded a net loss of $2 million in other (income) expense,
representing the impact of discontinuance of cash flow hedges because it is
probable that the originally forecasted transactions will not occur by the end
of the originally specified time period.
Refer to Note 12 for disclosures of movements in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income.
Concentration of Credit RiskThe Company invests its excess cash in both deposits with major banks throughout
the world and other high quality money market instruments. The Company has a
policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at
least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. These investments generally mature
within six months, and the Company has not incurred any related losses.
16 Savings Plan
The Company has voluntary 401(k) savings plans designed to enhance the existing
retirement programs covering eligible employees. The Company matches a
percentage of each employee's contributions consistent with the provisions of
the plan for which he/she is eligible.
In the U.S. salaried plan, one-third of the Company match was paid in Company
stock under an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) unless the employee chose to
redirect his or her investment. In 1990, to establish the ESOP, the Company
loaned $100 million to the ESOP Trust to purchase shares of the Company stock on
the open market. In exchange, the Company received a note, the balance of which
is recorded as a reduction of shareholders' equity. The remaining shares held by
the ESOP trust are expected to be allocated to participant accounts by the end
of February, 2005.
Total Company contributions to the plans were $143 million in 2004, $128 million
in 2003 and $111 million in 2002.

17 Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures
On December 15, 2004, Johnson & Johnson announced the signing of a definitive
agreement to acquire Guidant Corporation (Guidant), a world leader in the
treatment of cardiac and vascular disease, for $25.4 billion in fully diluted
equity value.
The Board of Directors of Johnson & Johnson and Guidant have given their
respective approvals to the transaction, which is subject to clearance under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, the European Union merger control
regulation, and other customary closing conditions. The acquisition could result
in the divestiture of certain assets and operations, if required by regulatory
agencies. The agreement requires the approval of Guidant's shareholders. Subject
to the aforementioned approvals, the acquisition is expected to close in the
third quarter of 2005.
Under the terms of the agreement, upon the close of the transaction each share
of Guidant common stock would be exchanged for $30.40 in cash and $45.60 in
Johnson & Johnson common stock, provided the average Johnson & Johnson common
stock price is between $55.45 and $67.09 during the 15-day trading period ending
three days prior to the transaction closing. Each Guidant common share exchanged
would be converted into Johnson & Johnson common stock of not more than .8224
and not less than .6797 shares, plus $30.40 in cash. Based on Guidant's
approximately 319 million common shares outstanding as of the close of business
on December 15, 2004, this would result in the issuance of not more than
approximately 262 million and not less than 217 million shares of Johnson &
Johnson common stock. Guidant's approximately 35 million option shares
outstanding as of the close of business on December 15, 2004 would be converted
into options to acquire Johnson & Johnson common stock on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under Guidant's option plan. The option shares
would convert to Johnson & Johnson common stock utilizing a floating exchange
ratio, the Exchange Ratio and the Cash Portion Option Exchange Multiple as
defined in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December 15, 2004.
Certain businesses were acquired for $455 million in cash and $15 million of
liabilities assumed during 2004. These acquisitions were accounted for by the
purchase method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in
the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
In addition, per the terms of the 2003 acquisition agreement with the Link Spine
Group, Inc., $125 million in cash was paid to the owners of the Link Spine
Group, Inc. in 2004 based on the date the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved the CHARITE Artificial Disc. Thus, the 2004 total cash
expenditures related to acquisition were $580 million.
The 2004 acquisitions included: Merck's 50% interest in the Johnson &
Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co. European non-prescription
pharmaceutical joint venture including all of the infrastructure and brand
assets managed by the European joint venture; Egea Biosciences, Inc. through the
exercise of the option to acquire the remaining outstanding stock not owned by
Johnson & Johnson, which has developed a proprietary technology platform called
Gene Writer, that allows for the rapid and highly accurate synthesis of DNA
sequences, gene assembly, and construction of large synthetic gene libraries;Artemis Medical, Inc., a privately held company with ultrasound and x-ray
visible biopsy site breast markers as well as hybrid markers; U.S. commercial
rights to certain patents and know-how in the field of sedation and analgesia
from Scott Lab, Inc.; Biapharm SAS, a privately held French producer and
marketer of skin care products centered around the leading brand BIAFINE; the
assets of Micomed, a privately owned manufacturer of spinal implants primarily
focused on supplying the German market; and the acquisition of the AMBI skin
care brand for women of color.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets
acquired amounted to $425 million and has been allocated to identifiable
intangibles and goodwill. The $125 million related to the U.S. FDA approval of
the CHARITE Artificial Disc was recorded as additional goodwill associated with
the 2003 Link Spine Group, Inc. acquisition. Thus total additions to intangibles
and goodwill in 2004 were $550 million. Approximately $18 million has been
identified as the value of in-process research and development (IPR&D)
associated with the Scott Lab acquisition. The value of the IPR&D was calculated
using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects.
The discount rate was 25%.
Certain businesses were acquired for $2.8 billion in cash and $323 million of
liabilities assumed during 2003. These acquisitions were accounted for by the
purchase method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in
the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
The 2003 acquisitions included: Link Spine Group, Inc., a privately owned
corporation with exclusive worldwide rights to the CHARITE Artificial Disc;
Scios Inc. a biopharmaceutical company with a marketed product for
cardiovascular disease and research projects focused on auto-immune diseases;
3-Dimensional Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a company with a technology platform
focused on the discovery and development of therapeutic small molecules;
OraPharma, Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development
and commercialization of unique oral therapeutics; and certain assets of
Orquest, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company focused on developing
biologically-based implants for orthopaedics and spine surgery.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets
acquired amounted to $1.8 billion and has been allocated to identifiable
intangibles and goodwill. Approximately $918 million has been identified as the
value of in-process research and development (IPR&D) primarily associated with
the acquisition of Link Spine Group, Inc. and Scios Inc.
The IPR&D charge related to the Link Spine Group, Inc. acquisition was $170
million and is associated with the CHARITE Artificial Disc. The CHARITE
Artificial Disc is marketed in more than 30 countries outside the U.S, and a
Premarket Approval Application was filed with U.S. Food and Drug Administration
on February 17, 2004. The value of the IPR&D was calculated with the assistance
of a third party appraiser using cash flow projections discounted for the risk
inherent in
55
<PAGE>
such projects. A probability of success factor of 95% was used to reflect
inherent clinical and regulatory risk. The discount rate was 19%. The purchase
price for the Link Spine Group, Inc. acquisition was allocated to the tangible
and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase
price over the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired was approximately
$84 million and was allocated to goodwill. Substantially all of the amount
allocated to goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes.
The IPR&D charge related to Scios Inc. was $730 million and is largely
associated with its p-38 kinase inhibitor program. The value of the IPR&D was
calculated with the assistance of a third party appraiser using cash flow
projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects using a 16%
probability of success factor and a 9% discount rate. The purchase price for the
Scios Inc. acquisition was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at
the acquisition date. Identifiable intangible assets included patents and
trademarks valued at approximately $1.5 billion. The excess of the purchase
price over the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired was approximately
$440 million and was allocated to goodwill. Substantially all of the amount
allocated to goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes.
The remaining IPR&D was associated with Orquest, Inc., and 3-Dimensional
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with charges of $11 million and $7 million, respectively.
In both cases the value of the IPR&D was calculated with the assistance of a
third party appraiser.
Certain businesses were acquired for $478 million in cash and liabilitiesassumed of $72 million during 2002. These acquisitions were accounted for by the
purchase method, and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in
the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
The 2002 acquisitions included Tibotec-Virco N.V., a privately-held
biopharmaceutical company focused on developing anti-viral treatments; Micro
Typing Systems, Inc., a manufacturer of reagents and supplier of distributed
instruments known as the ID-Micro Typing System and Obtech Medical AG, a
privately-held company that markets an adjustable gastric band for the treatment
of morbid obesity.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets of
the acquired entities amounted to $325 million and has been allocated to
identifiable intangibles and goodwill. Approximately $189 million has been
identified as the value of IPR&D associated with the Tibotec-Virco N.V. and
Obtech Medical AG acquisitions.
The IPR&D charge related to Tibotec-Virco N.V. was $150 million and is
associated with two early stage HIV compounds. The value of the IPR&D was
calculated with the assistance of a third party appraiser using cash flow
projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects using probability
of success factors ranging from 30-33%. The discount rate was 9%.
The IPR&D charge related to Obtech Medical AG was $39 million and is associated
with the development of the current Swedish Adjustable Gastric Band (SAGB) for
use in the United States as well as development of a next generation technology
platform. The value of the IPR&D was calculated with the assistance of a third
party appraiser using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in
such projects using a 70% probability of success factor and a 20% discount rate.
Supplemental pro forma information for 2004, 2003 and 2002 per SFAS No. 141,
Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
are not provided as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a
material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial
position.
Divestitures in 2004, 2003 and 2002 did not have a material effect on the
Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
18 Legal Proceedings
Product Liability
The Company is involved in numerous product liability cases in the United
States, many of which concern adverse reactions to drugs and medical devices.
The damages claimed are substantial, and while the Company is confident of the
adequacy of the warnings and instructions for use which accompany such products,
it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. However, the
Company believes that if any liability results from such cases, it will be
substantially covered by existing amounts accrued in the Company's balance sheet
under its self-insurance program and by third party product liability insurance.
One group of cases against the Company concerns the Janssen Pharmaceutica Inc.
product PROPULSID (cisapride), which was withdrawn from general sale and
restricted to limited use in 2000. In the wake of publicity about those events,
numerous lawsuits have been filed against Janssen, which is a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Company, and the Company regarding PROPULSID, in state and
federal courts across the country. There are approximately 423 such cases
currently pending, including the claims of approximately 5,900 plaintiffs. In
the active cases, 415 individuals are alleged to have died from the use of
PROPULSID. These actions seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and
accuse Janssen and the Company of inadequately testing for and warning about the
drug's side effects, of promoting it for off-label use and of over promotion. In
addition, Janssen and the Company have entered into agreements (tolling
agreements) with various plaintiffs' counsel halting the running of the statutes
of limitations with respect to the potential claims of a significant number of
individuals while those attorneys evaluate whether or not to sue Janssen and the
Company on their behalf.
In September 2001, the first ten plaintiffs in the Rankin case, which comprises
the claims of 155 PROPULSID plaintiffs, went to trial in state court in
Claiborne County, Mississippi. The jury returned compensatory damage verdicts
for each plaintiff in the amount of $10 million, for a total of $100 million.
The trial judge thereafter dismissed the claims of punitive damages. On March 4,
2002, the trial judge reduced these verdicts to a total of $48 million, and
denied the motions of Janssen and the Company for a new trial. On May 13, 2004,
the Supreme Court of Mississippi reversed the verdicts against Janssen and the
Company, and remanded the case to the trial court. The Supreme Court found the
joint trial of multiple plaintiffs' cases against Janssen was prejudicial and
directed the trial court to return the cases of the individual plaintiffs for
separate trials to their home counties. A motion for rehearing was denied onAugust 5, 2004.
56
<PAGE>
In April 2002, a state court judge in New Jersey denied plaintiffs' motion to
certify a national class of PROPULSID users for purposes of medical monitoring
and refund of the costs of purchasing PROPULSID. An effort to appeal that ruling
has been denied. In June 2002, the federal judge presiding over the PROPULSID
Multi-District Litigation in New Orleans, Louisiana similarly denied plaintiffs'
motion there to certify a national class of PROPULSID users. Plaintiffs in the
Multi-District Litigation have said they are preserving their right to appeal
that ruling, and other complaints filed against Janssen and the Company include
class action allegations, which could be the basis for future attempts to have
classes certified.
On February 5, 2004, Janssen announced that it had reached an agreement in
principle with the Plaintiffs Steering Committee (PSC), of the PROPULSID Federal
Multi-District Litigation (MDL), to resolve federal lawsuits related to
PROPULSID. There are approximately 4,000 individuals included in the Federal MDL
of whom approximately 300 are alleged to have died from use of the drug. The
agreement becomes effective once 85 percent of the death claims, and 75 percent
of the remainder, agree to the terms of the settlement. In addition, 12,000
individuals who have not filed lawsuits, but whose claims are the subject of
tolling agreements suspending the running of the statutes of limitations against
those claims, must also agree to participate in the settlement before it will
become effective. Those agreeing to participate in the settlement will submit
medical records to an independent panel of physicians who will determine whether
the claimed injuries were caused by PROPULSID and otherwise meet the standards
for compensation. If those standards are met, a court-appointed special master
will determine compensatory damages. If the agreement becomes effective, Janssen
will pay as compensation a minimum of $69.5 million and a maximum of $90
million, depending upon the number of plaintiffs who enroll in the program.
Janssen will also establish an administrative fund not to exceed $15 million,
and will pay legal fees to the PSC up to $22.5 million, subject to court
approval.
With respect to all the various PROPULSID actions against them, Janssen and the
Company dispute the claims in those lawsuits and are vigorously defending
against them except where, in their judgment, settlement is appropriate. Janssen
and the Company believe they have adequate self-insurance accruals and third
party product liability insurance with respect to these cases. In communications
to the Company, the excess insurance carriers have raised certain defenses to
their liability under the policies and to date have declined to reimburse
Janssen and the Company for PROPULSID-related costs despite demand for payment.
However, in the opinion of the Company, those defenses are pro forma and lack
substance and the carriers will honor their obligations under the policies
either voluntarily or after litigation. In March 2004, the Company commenced
arbitration against Allianz Underwriters Insurance Company, which issued the
first layer of applicable excess insurance coverage, to obtain reimbursement of
PROPULSID-related costs. The arbitration is currently scheduled to begin mid-
May 2005 and last several weeks.
The Company's Ethicon, Inc. subsidiary has over the last several years had a
number of claims and lawsuits filed against it relating to VICRYL sutures. The
actions allege that the sterility of VICRYL sutures was compromised by
inadequacies in Ethicon's systems and controls, causing patients who were
exposed to these sutures to incur infections which would not otherwise have
occurred. Ethicon on several occasions recalled batches of VICRYL sutures in
light of questions raised about sterility but does not believe any contamination
of suture products in fact occurred. In November 2003, a trial judge in West
Virginia certified for class treatment all West Virginia residents who had
VICRYL sutures implanted during Class I or II surgeries from May 1, 1994 to
December 31, 1997. The certification is subject to later challenge following the
conclusion of discovery. A previous trial date has been adjourned and not reset.
Ethicon has been and intends to continue vigorously defending against the
claims.
Affirmative Stent Patent Litigation
In patent infringement actions tried in Delaware Federal Court in late 2000,
Cordis Corporation, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, obtained verdicts of
infringement and patent validity, and damage awards, against Boston Scientific
Corporation and Medtronic AVE, Inc., based on a number of Cordis vascular stent
patents. On December 15, 2000, the jury in the damage action against Boston
Scientific returned a verdict of $324 million and on December 21, 2000, the jury
in the Medtronic AVE action returned a verdict of $271 million. These sums
represent lost profit and reasonable royalty damages to compensate Cordis for
infringement but do not include pre or post judgment interest. In February 2001
a hearing was held on the claims of Boston Scientific and Medtronic AVE that the
patents at issue were unenforceable owing to alleged inequitable conduct beforethe patent office.
In March and May 2002, the district judge issued post trial rulings that
confirmed the validity and enforceability of the main Cordis stent patent claims
but found certain other Cordis patents unenforceable. Further, the district
judge granted Boston Scientific a new trial on liability and damages and vacated
the verdict against Medtronic AVE on legal grounds. On August 12, 2003, the
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found the trial judge erred in vacating
the verdict against Medtronic AVE and remanded the case to the trial judge for
further proceedings. The trial judge has scheduled a trial in March 2005 against
Boston Scientific and Medtronic AVE in connection with Cordis' efforts to obtain
reinstatement of the original verdicts.
In January 2003, Cordis filed an additional patent infringement action against
Boston Scientific in Delaware Federal Court accusing its Express2 and TAXUS
stents of infringing one of the Cordis patents involved in the earlier actions
against Boston Scientific and Medtronic AVE. In February 2003, Cordis moved in
that action for a preliminary injunction seeking to bar the introduction of the
TAXUS stent based on that patent. On November 21, 2003, the district judge
denied that request for a preliminary injunction and that decision was affirmed
by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in May 2004. Trial of the case
is scheduled for June 2005. Cordis also has pending in Delaware Federal Court
another action against Medtronic AVE accusing Medtronic AVE of infringement by
sale of stent products introduced by Medtronic AVE subsequent to its GFX and
MicroStent products, the subject of the earlier action referenced above.
In early June 2003, an arbitration panel in Chicago, in a preliminary ruling,
found in favor of Cordis in its arbitration against
57
<PAGE>
ACS/Guidant involving infringement by ACS/Guidant of a Cordis stent patent. On
August 19, 2003, the panel confirmed that ruling, rejecting the challenge of
ACS/Guidant. Under the terms of an earlier agreement between Cordis and
ACS/Guidant, the arbitration panel's ruling obligated ACS/Guidant to make a
payment of $425 million to Cordis which was made in the fiscal fourth quarter of
2003. As a result of resolving this matter, in the fiscal fourth quarter, $230
million was recorded in other income and expense (approximately $142 million
after tax) relating to past periods. The balance of the award, $195 million
(approximately $120 million after tax), will be recognized in income in future
periods over the estimated remaining life of the intellectual property,
commencing in the first fiscal quarter of 2004. No additional royalties for
ACS/Guidant's continued use of the technology and no injunction are involved.
Patent Litigation Against Various Johnson & Johnson Operating Companies
The products of various Johnson & Johnson operating companies are the subject of
various patent lawsuits, which could potentially affect the ability of those
operating companies to sell those products, or require the payment of past
damages and future royalties. The following chart summarizes various patent
lawsuits concerning important products of Johnson & Johnson operating companies.
With respect to all of these matters, the Johnson & Johnson operating company
involved is vigorously defending against the claims of infringement and
disputing where appropriate the validity and enforceability of the patent claims
asserted against it.

Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)
The following chart indicates lawsuits pending against generic firms that filed
Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking to market generic forms of products
sold by various subsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the
applicable patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include
allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of these
patents. In the event the subsidiary of the Company involved is not successful
in these actions, the firms involved will then introduce generic versions of the
product at issue resulting in very substantial market share and revenue losses
for the product of the Company's subsidiary.

In the DURAGESIC (fentanyl transdermal system) matter referenced above, the
district court in March 2004 found ALZA's patent valid, enforceable and
infringed by Mylan's generic. That decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals
for the Federal Court. In June 2004, FDA ruled that Mylan's ANDA would be
subject to ALZA's period of pediatric exclusivity ending in January 2005. In
late June, Mylan filed actions against FDA seeking to require the agency to
grant it approval to market on July 24, 2004, the day after the DURAGESIC patent
expired. On August 17, 2004, the district court ruled against Mylan and in favor
of FDA's recognition of pediatric exclusivity for DURAGESIC, which decision was
affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
In the action against Mylan involving LEVAQUIN, the trial judge on December 23,
2004, found the patent at issue valid, enforceable and infringed by Mylan's
contemplated ANDA product and issued an injunction precluding sale of the
product until patent expiration in late 2010. Mylan has appealed to the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
In the action against Eon Labs involving SPORANOX (itraconazole), the district
court ruled on July 28, 2004 that Janssen's patent was valid but not infringed
by Eon's generic. Janssen has appealed this ruling to the Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit. Eon launched its generic version of SPORANOX on February 9,
2005.
In the action against Kali involving ULTRACET (tramadol hydrochloride/
acetaminophen), Kali has moved for summary judgment on the issues of
infringement and invalidity. The briefing on that motion was completed in
October 2004 and a decision is expected anytime. With respect to claims other
than that at issue in the litigation against Kali, Ortho-McNeil
59
<PAGE>
has filed a reissue application in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office seeking
to narrow the scope of the claims.
In the action against Mylan involving DITROPAN XL (oxybutynin chloride), Mylan
moved for summary judgment on July 14, 2004 on the issues of non-infringement
and invalidity. That motion was denied in December 2004.
In the action against Mylan relating to TOPAMAX (topiramate), Mylan on
October 8, 2004 filed a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of
Ortho-McNeil's patent. A decision is expected after February 1, 2005.
With respect to all of the above matters, the Johnson & Johnson operatingcompany involved is vigorously defending the validity and enforceability and
asserting the infringement of its own or its licensor's patents.
Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation
Johnson & Johnson and its pharmaceutical operating companies, along with
numerous other pharmaceutical companies, are defendants in a series of lawsuits
in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing
of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise
actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported
an inflated Average Wholesale Price for the drugs at issue. Most of these cases,
both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, have been
consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) in
federal court in Boston, Massachusetts. The plaintiffs in these cases include
classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase
of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made
Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. In the MDL proceeding in
Boston, plaintiffs have moved for class certification of all or some portion of
their claims. A decision is expected on that motion in the second or third
quarter of 2005.
Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson operating company which markets
endoscopic surgical instruments, and the Company, are named defendants in a
North Carolina state court class action lawsuit alleging AWP inflation and
improper marketing activities against TAP Pharmaceuticals. Ethicon Endo-Surgery,
Inc. is a defendant based on claims that several of its former sales
representatives are alleged to have been involved in arbitrage of a TAP drug.
The allegation is that these sales representatives persuaded certain physicians
in states where the drug's price was low to purchase from TAP excess quantities
of the drug and then resell it in states where its price was higher. Ethicon
Endo-Surgery, Inc. and the Company deny any liability for the claims made
against them in this case and are vigorously defending against it. On April 24,
2003, the trial judge certified a national class of purchasers of the TAP
product at issue. On July 6, 2004, that class was decertified by the North
Carolina Court of Appeals and the matter remanded to the trial court for
additional consideration. On January 5, 2005, the trial judge certified a North
Carolina State class of purchases of the TAP product in question. No trial date
has been set in this matter.
Other
The New York State Attorney General's office and the Federal Trade Commission
issued subpoenas in January and February 2003 seeking documents relating to the
marketing of sutures and endoscopic instruments by the Company's Ethicon, Inc.
and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. subsidiaries. The Connecticut Attorney General's
office also issued a subpoena for the same documents. These subpoenas focus on
the bundling of sutures and endoscopic instruments in contracts offered to Group
Purchasing Organizations and individual hospitals in which discounts are
predicated on the hospital achieving specified market share targets for both
categories of products. The operating companies involved have responded to the
subpoenas.
On June 26, 2003, the Company received a request for records and information
from the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Energy and Commerce in
connection with its investigation into pharmaceutical reimbursements and rebates
under Medicaid. The Committee's request focuses on the drug REMICADE
(infliximab), marketed by the Company's Centocor, Inc. subsidiary. On July 2,
2003, Centocor received a request that it voluntarily provide documents and
information to the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's Office, District of
New Jersey, in connection with its investigation into various Centocor marketing
practices. Both the Company and Centocor have responded to these requests for
documents and information.
On August 1, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) advised the
Company of its informal investigation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
allegations of payments to Polish governmental officials by U.S. pharmaceutical
companies. On November 21, 2003, the SEC advised the Company that the
investigation had become formal and issued a subpoena for the information
previously requested in an informal fashion, plus other background documents.
The Company and its operating units in Poland have responded to these requests.
On December 8, 2003, the Company's Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical unit received a
subpoena from the United States Attorney's office in Boston, Massachusetts
seeking documents relating to the marketing, including alleged off-label
marketing, of the drug TOPAMAX (topiramate). Ortho-McNeil is cooperating in
responding to the subpoena. In October 2004, the U.S. Attorney's Office in
Boston asked attorneys for Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical to cooperate in
facilitating the subpoenaed testimony of several present and former Ortho-McNeil
witnesses before a grand jury in Boston, for which cooperation is being
provided.On January 20, 2004, the Company's Janssen unit received a subpoena from the
Office of the Inspector General of the United States Office of Personnel
Management seeking documents concerning sales and marketing of, any and all
payments to physicians in connection with sales and marketing of, and clinical
trials for, RISPERDAL (risperidone) from 1997 to 2002. Documents subsequent to
2002 have also been requested. Janssen is cooperating in responding to the
subpoena.
In April 2004, the Company's pharmaceutical units were requested to submit
information to the Senate Finance Committee on their use of the "nominal pricing
exception" in calculating Best Price under the Medicaid Rebate Program. This
request was sent to manufacturers for the top twenty drugs reimbursed under the
Medicaid Program. The Company's pharmaceutical units have responded to the
request.
On July 27, 2004, the Company received a letter request from the New York State
Attorney General's Office for documents pertaining to marketing, off-label sales
and clinical trials for TOPAMAX (topiramate), RISPERDAL (risperidone), PROCRIT
(Epoetin alfa), REMINYL (galantamine HBr), REMICADE (infliximab) and ACIPHEX
(rabeprazole sodium). The Company is responding to the request.

On August 9, 2004, Johnson & Johnson Health Care Systems, Inc., a Johnson &
Johnson operating company, received a subpoena from the Dallas, Texas U. S.
Attorney's Office seeking documents relating to the relationships between the
group purchasing organization Novation and HCS and other Johnson & Johnson
operating companies. The Company's operating entities involved are responding to
the subpoena.
On September 30, 2004, Ortho Biotech Inc. received a subpoena from the U.S.
Office of Inspector General's Denver, Colorado field office seeking documents
directed to sales and marketing of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) from 1997 to the
present. Ortho Biotech is responding to the subpoena.
In September 2004, plaintiffs in an employment discrimination litigation
initiated against the Company in 2001 moved to certify a class of all African
American and Hispanic salaried employees of the Company and its affiliates in
the United States, who were employed at any time from November 1997 to the
present. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages for the period 1997 through the
present (including punitive damages) and equitable relief. The Company is
expected to file its response to plaintiffs' class certification motion in the
first half of 2005. A decision by the district court is not expected before late
2005. The Company disputes the allegations in the lawsuit and is vigorously
defending against them.
After a remand from the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in January 2003, a
partial retrial was commenced in October and concluded in November 2003 in
Boston, Massachusetts in the action Amgen v. Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc. (TKT)
and Aventis Pharmaceutical, Inc. The matter is a patent infringement action
brought by Amgen against TKT, the developer of a gene-activated EPO product, and
Aventis, which holds marketing rights to the TKT product, asserting that TKT's
product infringes various Amgen patent claims. TKT and Aventis dispute
infringement and are seeking to invalidate the Amgen patents asserted against
them. On October 15, 2004, the district court issued rulings that upheld its
initial findings in 2001, that Amgen's patent claims were valid and infringed.
Further proceedings and an appeal will follow. The Amgen patents at issue in the
case are exclusively licensed to Ortho Biotech Inc., a Johnson & Johnson
operating company, in the U.S. for non-dialysis indications. Ortho Biotech Inc.
is not a party to the action. On October 21, 2004, in a companion action brought
by TKT and Aventis against Amgen and Ortho Biotech's U.K. affiliate in the
United Kingdom, the House of Lords, acting as the highest court in the U.K.,
invalidated the pertinent claims of Amgen's U.K. patent on EPO which expired in
December 2004.
The Company is also involved in a number of other patent, trademark and other
lawsuits incidental to its business. The ultimate legal and financial liability
of the Company in respect to all claims, lawsuits and proceedings referred to
above cannot be estimated with any certainty. However, in the opinion of
management, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date
and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of
liabilities already accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, although the
resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a
significant impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for
that period.
19 Earnings Per ShareThe following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net

The diluted earnings per share calculation includes the dilution effect of
convertible debt: a decrease in interest expense of $14 million, $15 million and
$12 million after tax for years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Diluted earnings per share excludes 42 million, 47 million and 1 million shares
underlying stock options for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, as the exercise
price of these options was greater than their average market value, resulting in
an anti-dilutive effect on diluted earnings per share.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Under Section 404 of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management is required
to assess the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that
assessment, whether the Company's internal control over financial reporting is
effective.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as
to the reliability of the Company's financial reporting and the preparation offinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has
inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements.
Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
The Company's management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2005. In making this
assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in "Internal
Control-Integrated Framework." These criteria are in the areas of control
environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication,
and monitoring. The Company's assessment included extensive documenting,
evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal
control over financial reporting.
Based on the Company's processes and assessment, as described above, management
has concluded that, as of January 2, 2005, the Company's internal control over
financial reporting was effective.
Our management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2005 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Johnson & Johnson:
We have completed an integrated audit of Johnson & Johnson's fiscal 2004
consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of January 2, 2005 and audits of its fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, statements of equity and statements of cash
flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Johnson & Johnson and Subsidiaries (the "Company") at January 2, 2005 and
December 28, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended January 2, 2005 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, management's assessment, "Management's Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting," appearing on page 62 of the 2004 Annual
Report to Shareholders, that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of January 2, 2005 based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission "COSO", is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of January 2, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions onmanagement's assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of
internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

EXHIBIT 99(b)
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM
ACT OF 1995 -- "SAFE HARBOR" FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The Company may from time to time make certain forward-looking statements
in publicly-released materials, both written and oral. Forward-looking
statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and anticipate
results based on management's plans that are subject to uncertainty.
Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words like "plans,"
"expects," "will," "anticipates," "estimates" and other words of similar meaning
in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations,
financial performance, the Company's strategy for growth, product development,
regulatory approvals, market position and expenditures.
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future
events. The Company cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be
accurate, although the Company believes that it has been reasonable in its
expectations and assumptions. Investors should realize that if underlying
assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize,
actual results could vary materially from the Company's expectations and
projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on
any forward-looking statements. Furthermore, the Company assumes no obligation
to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or
future events or developments.
Some important factors that could cause the Company's actual results todiffer from the Company's expectations in any forward-looking statements are as
follows:
Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in interest
rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such
fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins;
Competitive factors, including technological advances achieved and
patents attained by competitors as well as new products introduced by
competitors, including the fact that there is continued competition in the
U.S. for PROCRIT, the top-selling product in the Company's portfolio and,
within the last year, competition for the CYPHER drug-eluting stent;
Challenges to the Company's patents by competitors or allegations that
the Company's products infringe the patents of third parties, which could
potentially affect the Company's competitive position and ability to sell
the products in question and require the payment of past damages and future
royalties. In particular, generic drug firms have filed Abbreviated New
Drug Applications seeking to market generic forms of most of the Company's
key pharmaceutical products, prior to expiration of the applicable patents
covering those products. In the event that the Company is not successful in
defending the resulting lawsuits, generic versions of the product at issue
will be introduced, resulting in very substantial market share and revenue
losses;
Financial distress and bankruptcies experienced by significant
customers and suppliers that could impair their ability, as the case may
be, to purchase the Company's products, pay for products previously
purchased or meet their obligations to the Company under supply
arrangements;
The impact on political and economic conditions due to terrorist
attacks in the U.S. and other parts of the world or U.S. military action
overseas, as well as instability in the financial markets which could
result from such terrorism or military actions;
Interruptions of computer and communication systems, including
computer viruses, that could impair the Company's ability to conduct
business and communicate internally and with its customers;
Health care changes in the U.S. and other countries resulting in
pricing pressures, including the continued consolidation among health care
providers, trends toward managed care and health care cost
<PAGE>
containment and government laws and regulations relating to sales and
promotion, reimbursement and pricing generally;
Government laws and regulations, affecting U.S. and foreign
operations, including those relating to securities laws compliance, trade,
monetary and fiscal policies, taxes, price controls, regulatory approval of
new products, licensing and patent rights, and including, in particular,
proposed amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act, implementation of the recently
enacted Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003 and possible drug reimportation legislation;
Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement
of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant and
results from time to time in product and process obsolescence. The
development of new and improved products is important to the Company's
success in all areas of its business;
Difficulties inherent in product development, including the potential
inability to successfully continue technological innovation, complete
clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals in the United States and
abroad, gain and maintain market approval of products and the possibility
of encountering infringement claims by competitors with respect to patent
or other intellectual property rights which can preclude or delay
commercialization of a product;
Significant litigation adverse to the Company including product
liability claims, patent infringement claims, and antitrust claims;
The health care industry has come under increased scrutiny by
government agencies and state attorney generals and resulting
investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and
criminal penalties, including debarment from government business;
Product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls,
regulatory action on the part of the FDA (or foreign counterparts) or
declining sales. While the Company's affiliates do not sell any COX-2inhibitor medicines, the recent developments involving those medicines
demonstrate these risks and are likely to have implications throughout the
health care industry;
The impact of business combinations, including acquisitions and
divestitures, both internally for the Company and externally in the
pharmaceutical and health care industries; and
Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board.
The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could
impact upon the Company's ability to achieve results described in any
forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible
to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be
a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company has
identified the factors on this list as permitted by the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

PART I
Item 1. BUSINESS
General
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries have approximately 118,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field.
Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, which has more than 250 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. Johnson & Johnson’s primary focus has been on products related to
human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.
The Company’s structure is based on the principle of decentralized management. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the operations and allocation of
the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments. Each subsidiary within the business
segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens of the country where it is located.
Segments of Business
Johnson & Johnson’s operating companies are organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Additional information required by this item is
incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of segments and operating results under the captions “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial Condition” on pages 34 through 43 and Note 11 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” under “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” on page 55 of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this
Report on Form 10-K.
Consumer
The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, skin care, oral care, wound care and women’s health care fields, as well as nutritional and over-the-counter pharmaceutical
products. The Baby Care franchise includes the JOHNSON’S® Baby line of products. Major brands in the Skin Care franchise include the AVEENO®; CLEAN & CLEAR®; JOHNSON’S® Adult; NEUTROGENA®;
RoC®; LUBRIDERM®; Beijing Dabao Cosmetics Co., Ltd.; and Vendôme product lines. The Oral Care franchise includes the LISTERINE® and REACH® oral care lines of products. Major brands in the Women’s Health
franchise are the CAREFREE® Pantiliners and STAYFREE® sanitary protection products. The nutritional and over-the-counter lines include SPLENDA®, No Calorie Sweetener; the broad family of TYLENOL®
acetaminophen products; SUDAFED® cold, flu and allergy products; ZYRTEC® allergy products; MOTRIN® IB ibuprofen products; and PEPCID® AC Acid Controller from Johnson & Johnson • Merck Consumer
Pharmaceuticals Co. These products are marketed principally to the general public and sold both to wholesalers and directly to independent and chain retail outlets throughout the world.
Pharmaceutical
The Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following therapeutic areas: anti-infective, antipsychotic, cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology, gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, neurology,
oncology, pain management, urology and virology. These products are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for prescription use by the general public. Key products in the
Pharmaceutical segment include: REMICADE® (infliximab), a biologic approved for the treatment of Crohn’s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and use in the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis; TOPAMAX® (topiramate), approved for adjunctive and monotherapy use in epilepsy, as well as for the prophylactic treatment of migraines; PROCRIT® (Epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as
EPREX®), a biotechnology-derived product that stimulates red blood cell production; RISPERDAL® oral (risperidone), a medication that treats the symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar mania and irritability associated with
autistic behavior in indicated patients, RISPERDAL® CONSTA® (risperidone), a long-acting injectable, and INVEGATM (paliperdone) Extended-Release tablets, for the treatment of schizophrenia; LEVAQUIN®
(levofloxacin) and FLOXIN® (ofloxacin), both in the anti-infective field; CONCERTA® (methylphenidate HCl), a product for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; ACIPHEX®/PARIET®, a proton
pump inhibitor co-marketed with Eisai Inc.; and DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl Transdermal (fentanyl transdermal system, sold outside the U.S. as DUROGESIC®), a treatment for chronic pain that offers a novel delivery
system.Table of Contents
Medical Devices and Diagnostics
The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of products distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, therapists,
hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and clinics. These products include Cordis’ circulatory disease management products; DePuy’s orthopaedic joint reconstruction, spinal care and sports medicine products; Ethicon’s surgical
care and women’s health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery’s minimally invasive surgical products; LifeScan’s blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics’ professional diagnostic
products and Vistakon’s disposable contact lenses. Distribution to these health care professional markets is done both directly and through surgical supply and other dealers.
Geographic Areas
The international business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by subsidiaries located in 56 countries outside the United States, which are selling products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The
products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “— Segments of Business — Consumer,” “— Pharmaceutical” and “— Medical Devices and Diagnostics.” However, the
principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include not only those developed in the United States,
but also those developed by subsidiaries abroad.
Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive
economic policies and political uncertainties.
Raw Materials
Raw materials essential to Johnson & Johnson’s operating companies’ businesses are generally readily available from multiple sources.
Patents and Trademarks
Johnson & Johnson and its operating companies have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to
their products and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to Johnson & Johnson in the operation of its businesses. Sales of the Company’s two largest products,
REMICADE® (infliximab) and TOPAMAX® (topiramate), accounted for approximately 6% and 4% of Johnson & Johnson’s total revenues, respectively, for fiscal 2008. Accordingly, the patents related to these products
are believed to be material to Johnson & Johnson as a whole.
The material patents that expired in 2007 and 2008 are related to RISPERDAL® (risperidone), which expired in the United States in December 2007, and TOPAMAX®, which expired in the United States in
September 2008. The Company has received pediatric extensions for RISPERDAL® oral and TOPAMAX® from the FDA, which granted market exclusivity in the United States through June 2008 and March 2009,
respectively. The next significant patent scheduled to expire on December 20, 2010 is for LEVAQUIN® (levofloxacin), which accounted for 2.5% of the Company’s 2008 sales. A pediatric extension for LEVAQUIN® was
granted by the FDA, which extends market exclusivity in the United States through June 20, 2011.
Johnson & Johnson’s operating companies have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected
by registration in the United States and other countries where such products are marketed. Johnson & Johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.
2Table of Contents
Seasonality
Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions,
principally for advertising and research and development activity.
Competition
In all of their product lines, Johnson & Johnson’s operating companies compete with companies both large and small, located throughout the world. Competition is strong in all product lines without regard to the
number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of
new and improved products is important to Johnson & Johnson’s success in all areas of its businesses. This also includes protecting the Company’s portfolio of intellectual property. The competitive environment requires
substantial investments in continuing research and multiple sales forces. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer acceptance of the products of Johnson & Johnson’s consumer businesses involves
significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
Research and Development
Research activities represent a significant part of Johnson & Johnson’s subsidiaries’ businesses. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States but also in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France,
Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom. The costs of worldwide Company-sponsored research activities relating to the development of new products, improvement of existing products,
technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of consumers and patients, excluding in-process research and development charges, amounted to $7.6 billion, $7.7 billion and
$7.1 billion for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. These costs are charged directly to expense, or directly against income, in the year in which incurred.
Environment
Johnson & Johnson’s operating companies are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental protection measures. Johnson & Johnson believes that its operations comply in all material respects with
applicable environmental laws and regulations. Johnson & Johnson’s compliance with these requirements did not during the past year, and is not expected to, have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows,
earnings or competitive position.
Regulation
Most of Johnson & Johnson’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent
regulation. In the United States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing,
advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the FDA continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA clearance of new drugs and
devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the United States.
The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the United States, attention has
been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in
the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care. In the United States, implementation of the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 may cause uncertainty in reimbursement levels in certain product segments.
3Table of Contents
The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson & Johnson’s operating companies operate have administrative powers that may subject those companies to such actions as product withdrawals, recalls,
seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, Johnson & Johnson’s operating companies may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.
In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and
prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.

In addition to the manufacturing facilities discussed above, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries maintain numerous office and warehouse facilities throughout the world. Research facilities are also discussed in

Johnson & Johnson’s properties are maintained in good operating condition and repair and are well utilized.
For information regarding lease obligations, see Note 4 “Rental Expense and Lease Commitments” under “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” on page 51 of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The information set forth in Note 18 “Legal Proceedings” under “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” on pages 62 through 66 of the Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference and filed as
Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.
The Company or its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and
comparable state laws, in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and future remediation. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in the opinion of the Company, such
proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.

Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
Not applicable.
Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dominic J. Caruso, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed
and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Weldon and Caruso concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2008. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria
established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework.” These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control
activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control over financial
reporting.
Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December 28, 2008, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2008 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated
in their report, which appears in the “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” on page 69 of the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on
Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended December 28, 2008, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in
connection with the evaluation of such referred to above in this Item 9A that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

EX-10.J 2 y74152exv10wj.htm EX-10.J: AMENDMENTS TO CERTIFICATE OF EXTRA COMPENSATION PLAN
Exhibit 10(j)
AMENDMENTS TO THE
CERTIFICATE OF EXTRA COMPENSATION PLAN
Effective as of January 1, 2009, the Certificate of Extra Compensation Plan (the “Plan”) shall be amended as follows:
1. Plan Name Change. The Plan shall be renamed the “Certificate of Long-Term Compensation Plan,” and all references in the Plan to “CEC” shall be changed to “CLC.”
2. Section 409A Amendments. The following new Article “SEVENTEENTH” shall be inserted at the end of the Plan:
“SEVENTEENTH: Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the terms of this Article “SEVENTEENTH” shall apply to the payment of the Formula Value of the Employee’s 409A Shares. For purposes of this Plan, the term
“409A Shares” shall mean CLC Shares that are awarded or vested after December 31, 2004 (the “409A Shares”). This Article “SEVENTEENTH” is intended to ensure that the terms of the Plan comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, and the regulations and other guidance issued thereunder (“Section 409A”).
(a) Payment of 409A Shares. The Formula Value of an Employee’s 409A Shares shall be payable only upon the occurrence of a 409A Payment Event. Subject to the limitations applicable to Specified Employees set forth in this Article
“SEVENTEENTH,” the Company shall pay the Formula Value of the Employee’s 409A Shares in a single lump sum within the 90-day period beginning on the date of the 409A Payment Event. The Employee shall have no influence on any
determination as to the tax year in which the payment is made.
(b) 409A Payment Event. For purposes of this Plan, the term “409A Payment Event” shall mean the date on which one of the following occurs with respect to an Employee (or a date related to the occurrence of one of the following):
i) Separation from Service (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(h) and other applicable rules under Section 409A);
ii) Death; or
iii) Disability (within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”) and the regulations thereunder).
With respect to an Employee who is placed on “long-term disability” as provided in Article “THIRD,” above, the Company shall determine whether a Separation from Service has occurred with respect to the Employee based on the facts
and circumstances for purposes of establishing the time of payment for the Employee’s 409A Shares. The Company’s determination shall be made initially within 60 days of the date the Employee is placed on “long-term disability,” and
each anniversary of such date thereafter.
(c) No Deferral of Payment. An Employee may not elect to defer receipt of any portion of the Formula Value of his/her 409A Shares or to receive such amounts in the form of installment payments. An Employee’s election to defer receipt of
any portion of his/her CEC holdings or to be paid in installments pursuant to the provisions of Articles “FOURTH” and “SEVENTH,” above, shall be effective solely with respect to the portion of the Formula Value of the Employee’s CLC
Shares that were awarded and vested before January 1, 2005 (the “Grandfathered Shares”).
(d) Limitations Applicable to Specified Employees. No portion of the Formula Value of a Specified Employee’s 409A Shares shall be paid before the expiration of the six-month period specified in Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) and the
regulations thereunder. This delay shall not affect the payment of any portion of the Formula Value of a Specified Employee’s Grandfathered Shares. For purposes of this Plan, “Specified Employee” shall mean a “key employee” (within the
meaning of Code Section 416(i) without regard to paragraph (5) thereof) who is one of the top 50 highest paid officers of the Company on the applicable determination date pursuant to procedures adopted by the Company. For purposes of
identifying Specified Employees under this Article “SEVENTEENTH,” “compensation” shall be determined under the safe harbor definition set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(d)-2(d)(3) and shall exclude all compensation
permitted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(ii).
(e) Payment Upon Termination of the Plan. Upon termination of the Plan pursuant to Article “SIXTEENTH” hereof with respect to all Employees and the termination of all other arrangements sponsored by the Company that would be
aggregated with the Plan under Section 409A, the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, and notwithstanding any elections made by an Employee, to pay the Formula Value of an Employee’s 409A Shares in a lump sum to the
extent permitted under Section 409A and the regulations and guidance thereunder. All payments made under this Article “SEVENTEENTH” upon termination of the Plan shall be made no earlier than the thirteenth (13th) month and no later
than the twenty-fourth (24th) month after the termination of the Plan. The Company may not accelerate payments pursuant to this Article “SEVENTEENTH” if the termination of the Plan is proximate to a downturn in the Company’s
financial health. If the Company exercises its discretion to accelerate payments under this Article “SEVENTEENTH,” the Company shall not adopt any new arrangement that would have been aggregated with the Plan under Section 409A
within three (3) years following the date of the Plan’s termination.
(f) Provisions Intended to Ensure Compliance with Code Section 409A. This Article “SEVENTEENTH” and any other provision of this Plan that applies to 409A Shares, including the rights of the Company or an Employee with respect to the
409A Shares, shall be limited to those terms permitted under Section 409A. Any terms not permitted under Section 409A shall be automatically modified and limited to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A, but only to the
extent such modification or limitation is permitted under Section 409A.

accordance with, and to the fullest extent permitted by, applicable guidance under Section 409A, including, but not limited to, IRS Notice 2005-1, Proposed Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A, Preamble Section XI.C, and IRS Notice

election that would not otherwise be payable in that year.
(g) Provisions Not Applicable to Grandfathered Shares. This Article “SEVENTEENTH” shall in no event apply to any portion of the Formula Value of an Employee’s Grandfathered Shares. No amendment or change to this Plan or any other
change (including an exercise of discretion) with respect to the Grandfathered Shares made after October 3, 2004, shall be effective if such amendment or change would constitute a “material modification” within the meaning of
Section 409A.”CERTIFICATION OF SECTION 409A AMENDMENTS

Exhibit 10(n)
AMENDMENTS TO THE
EXECUTIVE INCOME DEFERRAL PLAN
The Executive Income Deferral Plan (the “Plan”) shall be amended by inserting the following two new Sections at the end of the Plan, effective as of January 1, 2009, or as of the date otherwise specifically provided below:
“13. Section 409A Requirements. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, effective as of January 1, 2009, the terms of this Section 13 shall apply to the deferral of income elected on or after January 1, 2005 (the “409A
Deferrals”), and the payment of such amounts. This Section 13 is intended to ensure that the terms of the Plan comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations and other guidance issued thereunder
(“Section 409A”).
(a) Creation of 409A Accounts. Effective as of January 1, 2005, each participant’s Income Deferral Account shall be divided into two separate accounts as follows: (i) a “409A Account,” which shall consist of all 409A Deferrals and the
earnings thereon; and (ii) a “Grandfathered Account,” which shall consist of all Deferred Awards credited to a participant’s Income Deferral Account before January 1, 2005 (the “Grandfathered Deferrals”). Except as specifically provided
in this Section 13, all references in this Plan to Income Deferral Accounts shall include the 409A Account and the Grandfathered Account, and all references to Deferred Awards shall include the 409A Deferrals and the Grandfathered
Deferrals.
(b) Election of 409 Deferrals: No participant may elect to defer any portion of any dividend equivalents that are payable under the Company’s CEC Plan on or after January 1, 2009. Effective as of January 1, 2005, each participant may elect
(i) to defer any non-performance-based compensation, incentive payment, or dividend equivalent monies for services performed during a taxable year, provided such election is made on or before the end of the taxable year preceding the
year in which services are rendered; and (ii) to defer any performance based compensation (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(e)) on or before the date that is six months before the end of the performance period, provided
that in no event may such election be made after such compensation has become readily ascertainable. The Company shall establish procedures applicable to the form and timing of such deferral elections in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 13(b).
(c) Payment of 409A Accounts. The value of a participant’s 409A Account shall be payable only upon the occurrence of a 409A Payment Event. The Company shall pay the value of a participant’s 409A Account in a single lump sum as soon as
practicable after the later of (i) the expiration of the six-month period specified in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the “Code”) and the regulations thereunder, and (ii) January 15 of the year
immediately following the year of the 409A Payment Event. The participant shall have no influence on any determination as to the tax year in which the payment is made.
(d) 409A Payment Event. For purposes of this Plan, the term “409A Payment Event” shall mean the date on which one of the following occurs with respect to a participant (or a date related to the occurrence of one of the following):
i) Separation from Service (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(h) and other applicable rules under Section 409A);
ii) Death; or
iii) Disability (within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(C) and the regulations thereunder).
With respect to a participant who is placed on “long-term disability,” the Company shall determine whether a Separation from Service has occurred with respect to the participant based on the facts and circumstances for purposes of
establishing the time of payment for the participant’s 409A Account. The Company’s determination shall be made initially within 60 days of the date the participant is placed on “long-term disability,” and each anniversary of such date
thereafter.
(e) No Deferral of Payment. A participant may not elect to defer receipt of any portion of his 409A Account or to receive such amounts in the form of installment payments. A participant’s election to defer receipt of any portion of his Income
Deferral Account or to be paid in installments pursuant to the provisions of Section 7, above, shall be effective solely with respect to the participant’s Grandfathered Account and shall in no event apply to his 409A Account.
(f) Provisions Intended to Ensure Compliance with Section 409A. This Section 13 and any other provision of this Plan that applies to 409A Deferrals and 409A Accounts, including the rights of the Company or a participant with respect to the
409A Deferrals and 409A Accounts, shall be limited to those terms permitted under Section 409A. Any terms not permitted under Section 409A shall be automatically modified and limited to the extent necessary to comply with
Section 409A, but only to the extent such modification or limitation is permitted under Section 409A.
Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, effective as of October 3, 2004, the Company may, in its discretion, require or permit on an elective basis a change in the payment terms applicable to a participant’s 409A Account in
accordance with, and to the fullest extent permitted by, applicable guidance under Section 409A, including, but not limited to, IRS Notice 2005-1, Proposed Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A, Preamble Section XI.C, and IRS Notice
2007-86, provided that such election (i) is made on or before December 31, 2008, (ii) applies only to amounts that would not otherwise be payable in the year of the election, and (iii) does not cause an amount to be paid in the year of the
election that would not otherwise be payable in that year.
(g) Provisions Not Applicable to Grandfathered Deferrals and Grandfathered Accounts. This Section 13 shall in no event apply to any portion of a participant’s Grandfather Deferrals or Grandfathered Account. No amendment or change to this
Plan or any other change (including an exercise of discretion) with respect to the Grandfathered Deferrals or Grandfathered Accounts made after October 3, 2004, shall be effective if such amendment or change would constitute a “material
modification” within the meaning of Section 409A.
14. Payment Upon Termination of the Plan. The Company may terminate the Plan at any time. However, such amendment shall not without the consent of a participant, materially adversely affect any right or obligation with respect to any Deferred Award
made theretofore. Upon termination of the Plan pursuant to this Section 14 with respect to all participants and the termination of all other arrangements sponsored by the Company that would be aggregated with the Plan under Section 409A, the Company
shall have the right, in its sole discretion, and notwithstanding any elections made by a participant, to pay to each participant the value of his Income Deferral Account in a lump sum to the extent permitted under Section 409A. All payments made under
this Section 14 upon termination of the Plan shall be made no earlier than the thirteenth (13th) month and no later than the twenty-fourth (24th) month after the termination of the Plan. The Company may not accelerate payments pursuant to this Section 14
if the termination of the Plan is proximate to a downturn in the Company’s financial health. If the Company exercises its discretion to accelerate payments under this Section 14, the Company shall not adopt any new arrangement that would have been
aggregated with the Plan under Section 409A within three (3) years following the date of the Plan’s termination.”CERTIFICATION OF SECTION 409A AMENDMENTS

409A Addendum is intended to ensure that the terms of the Plan comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations and other guidance issued thereunder (“Section 409A”). The provisions of
this 409A Addendum and any other section of the Plan that applies to the payment of benefits on or after January 1, 2009, shall be limited to those terms permitted under Section 409A. Any terms of the Plan that are not permitted under
Section 409A shall be automatically modified and limited to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A, but only to the extent such modification or limitation is permitted under Section 409A.
2. 409A Payment Event. No payment shall be made to, or in respect of, any participant under this Plan prior to the occurrence of a 409A Payment Event. For purposes of this Plan, the term “409A Payment Event” shall mean the date on which

c. Disability (within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(C) and the regulations thereunder);
With respect to a participant who retires from an Approved Absence from “long-term disability” as defined in the Company’s long-term disability income plan, the Company shall determine whether a Separation from Service has occurred
with respect to the participant based on the facts and circumstances for purposes of establishing the time of payment for the participant’s benefits under the Plan. The Company’s determination shall be made initially within 60 days of the
date the participant is placed on “long-term disability,” and each anniversary of such date thereafter.
3. Payment of Excess Savings Accounts – General. Upon the occurrence of a 409A Payment Event, the value of a participant’s Excess Savings Account shall be paid in a single lump sum within the 90-day period beginning on the date of the
409A Payment Event. In no event shall a participant have any influence on any determination as to the tax year in which a payment is made under this Section 3.
4. Payment of Excess Savings Account – Grandfathered Payment Election. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, if a participant has an Effective Grandfathered Payment Election in place and his 409A Payment
Event occurs after the participant attains age 55, the value of a participant’s Excess Savings Account shall be paid in the form and at the time so elected by the participant. For purposes of this Plan, an “Effective Grandfathered Payment

determine whether a participant has made an Effective Grandfathered Payment Election, including the effective date of such election. A participant’s Effective Grandfathered Payment Election shall be irrevocable as of December 15, 2008,
and shall apply to the total value of a participant’s Excess Savings Account.
5. Death of Participant Before Commencement of Benefits. If a participant dies before his Excess Savings Account is paid, the value of the participant’s Excess Savings Account shall be paid to the participant’s beneficiary as soon practicable
within the 90-day period beginning on the date of the participant’s death.
The delayed payment rules applicable to Specified Employees shall not apply to payments made on account of a participant’s death.
6. No Deferral of Payment. Except as provided in Section 4 of this 409A Addendum with respect to a participant’s Effective Grandfathered Payment Election, a participant may not elect to defer receipt of any portion of his benefit under the
Plan.

permitted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(ii). Any amount that would have been paid to a Specified Employee but for the six-month delay imposed by this Section 7 of the 409A Addendum shall be paid in a single lump
sum to the participant during the seventh month after the participant’s 409A Payment Event.
8. Designated Payment Date. A payment shall be treated as being made on the designated payment date if it is actually made on the designated payment date or on a later date that is either in the same calendar year as the designated payment
date or, if later, by the 15th day of the third calendar month following the designated payment date. In addition, a payment shall be treated as made on the designated payment date if it is made no more than 30 days before the designated

9. Payment Upon Plan Termination. The Company may terminate the Plan at any time. Upon termination of the Plan with respect to all participants and the termination of all other arrangements sponsored by the Company that would be
aggregated with the Plan under Section 409A, the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, and notwithstanding any elections made by a participant, to pay to each participant the value of his 409A Amount in a lump sum to the
extent permitted under Section 409A. All payments made under this Section 9 of the 409A Addendum upon termination of the Plan shall be made no earlier than the 13th month and no later than the 24th month after the termination of the
Plan. The Company may not accelerate payments pursuant to this Section 9 of the 409A Addendum if the termination of the Plan is proximate to a downturn in the Company’s financial health. If the Company exercises its discretion to
accelerate payments under this Section 9 of the 409A Addendum, the Company shall not adopt any new arrangement that would have been aggregated with the Plan under Section 409A within three years following the date of the Plan’s
termination.”CERTIFICATION OF SECTION 409A AMENDMENTS

3. 409A Payment Event. No payment shall be made to, or in respect of, a participant’s 409A Benefit under this Plan prior to the occurrence of a 409A Payment Event. For purposes of this Plan, the term “409A Payment Event” shall mean the
date on which one of the following occurs with respect to a participant (or a date related to the occurrence of one of the following):
a. Separation from Service (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(h) and other applicable rules under Section 409A);
b. Death;
c. Disability (within the meaning of Code Section 409A(a)(2)(C) and the regulations thereunder);
With respect to a participant who retires from an Approved Absence from “long-term disability” as defined in the Company’s long-term disability income plan, the Company shall determine whether a Separation from Service has occurred
with respect to the participant based on the facts and circumstances for purposes of establishing the time of payment for the participant’s benefits under the Plan. The Company’s determination shall be made initially within 60 days of the
date the participant is placed on “long-term disability,” and each anniversary of such date thereafter.
4. Payment of 409A Benefit. Upon the occurrence of a 409A Payment Event, a participant’s 409A Benefit shall be paid on the participant’s Pension Commencement Date. For purposes of this Plan, a participant’s “Pension Commencement
Date” shall be the first day of the month on or after the participant’s (i) 55th birthday or (ii) 409A Payment Event, whichever is later. The time and form of payment of a participant’s Grandfathered Benefit shall be governed by the terms of
the Plan in effect as of October 3, 2004.
5. Form of Payment of 409A Benefit. Unless otherwise elected by a participant pursuant to applicable rules and procedures under the Plan, a participant’s 409A Benefit shall be payable in the form of a single life annuity if the participant is
single when the payment commences, or in the form of a joint and 50% surviving spouse annuity if the participant is married when the distribution commences. A participant may elect in writing, in such manner, at such times, and pursuant
to any rules and procedures as the Company may adopt, to receive his 409A Benefit in any form of payment that is available under the Consolidated Retirement Plan of Johnson & Johnson (the “Qualified Plan”), other than the Level Income
Options, provided that such election satisfies each of the following conditions:
a. The change in the form of payment complies with Section 409A and Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(ii);
b. Payment of the participant’s 409A Benefit has not commenced as of the date of the election;
c. The actuarially equivalent life annuity form elected by the participant has the same scheduled Payment Commencement Date as the annuity that would otherwise have been paid absent such election; and
d. The annuities are determined by the Company to be actuarially equivalent applying reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the lump sum value of a participant’s total accrued benefit under the Plan is less than $5,000, the participant’s total benefit under the Plan shall be paid to the participant or the participant’s beneficiary, in the
event of the participant’s death, in a single lump sum as soon as practicable within the 90-day period commencing on the participant’s 409A Payment Event. In addition, if a participant is eligible to receive any portion of his 409A Benefit in
the form of a lump sum payment, that portion of his 409A Benefit shall be paid to him in the form of a lump sum on the participant’s Pension Commencement Date, and the remaining portion of his 409A Benefit shall be paid in the
applicable annuity form in accordance with this Section 5.
6. Death of Participant Before Commencement of Benefits. If a participant dies before his Pension Commencement Date, his 409A Benefit shall be paid to the participant’s beneficiary commencing as of the first day of the month on or after
(i) the participant’s 55th birthday or (ii) the participant’s date of death, whichever is later. The delayed payment rules applicable to Specified Employees shall not apply to payments made on account of a participant’s death.
7. No Deferral of Payment. A participant may not elect to defer receipt of any portion of his benefit under the Plan.
8. Delayed Payment Rules for Specified Employees. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no portion of a Specified Employee’s 409A Benefit shall be payable before the expiration of the six-month period specified in Code
Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) and the regulations thereunder. For purposes of this Plan, “Specified Employee” shall mean a “key employee” (within the meaning of Code Section 416(i) without regard to paragraph (5) thereof) who is one of the
top 50 highest paid officers of the Company on the applicable determination date pursuant to procedures adopted by the Company. For purposes of identifying Specified Employees under this 409A Addendum, “compensation” shall be
determined under the safe harbor definition set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(d)-2(d)(3) and shall exclude all compensation permitted under Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(ii). Any amount that would have been paid
to a Specified Employee but for the six-month delay imposed by this Section 8 of the 409A Addendum shall be paid in a single lump sum to the participant during the seventh month after the participant’s 409A Payment Event.
This Section 8 of the 409A Addendum shall in no event apply to a participant’s Grandfathered Benefit.
9. Designated Payment Date. A payment shall be treated as being made on the designated payment date if it is actually made on the designated payment date or on a later date that is either in the same calendar year as the designated payment
date or, if later, by the 15th day of the third calendar month following the designated payment date. In addition, a payment shall be treated as made on the designated payment date if it is made no more than 30 days before the designated
payment date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a participant shall in no way be permitted, either directly or indirectly, to designate the taxable year of a payment under this Plan.
10. Payment Upon Plan Termination. The Company may terminate the Plan at any time. Upon termination of the Plan with respect to all participants and the termination of all other arrangements sponsored by the Company that would be
aggregated with the Plan under Section 409A, the Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion, and notwithstanding any elections made by a participant, to pay to each participant the actuarially equivalent value of his Excess Pension
Benefit determined as of the Plan termination date in a lump sum, to the extent permitted under Section 409A. All payments made under this Section 10 of the 409A Addendum upon termination of the Plan shall be made no earlier than the
13th month and no later than the 24th month after the termination of the Plan. The Company may not accelerate payments pursuant to this Section 10 of the 409A Addendum if the termination of the Plan is proximate to a downturn in the
Company’s financial health. If the Company exercises its discretion to accelerate payments under this Section 10 of the 409A Addendum, the Company shall not adopt any new arrangement that would have been aggregated with the Plan
under Section 409A within three years following the date of the Plan’s termination.
11. Special Transition Election. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, effective as of October 3, 2004, the Company may, in its discretion, require or permit on an elective basis a change in the payment terms applicable to a
participant’s 409A Benefit in accordance with, and to the fullest extent permitted by, applicable guidance under Section 409A, including, but not limited to, IRS Notice 2005-1, Proposed Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A, Preamble
Section XI.C, and IRS Notice 2007-86, provided that such election (i) is made on or before December 31, 2008, (ii) applies only to amounts that would not otherwise be payable in the year of the election, and (iii) does not cause an amount
to be paid in the year of the election that would not otherwise be payable in that year. In particular, with respect to a participant who is eligible to receive a portion of his 409A Benefit in the form of a lump sum payment, the Company may,
in its discretion, permit such participant to make an irrevocable election on or before December 31, 2008, to receive such portion in a lump sum payment as of his Pension Commencement Date. Any payment election made by a participant
to receive his benefit in a lump sum payment under this Section 11 of the 409A Addendum shall be irrevocable as of the date submitted in accordance with the procedures established by the Company.
12. Provisions Not Applicable to Grandfathered Benefits. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, this 409A Addendum shall in no event apply to any portion of a participant’s Grandfathered Benefit. No amendment or change to this
Plan or any other change (including an exercise of discretion) with respect to a participant’s Grandfathered Benefit made after October 3, 2004, shall be effective if such amendment or change would constitute a “material modification”
within the meaning of Section 409A.CERTIFICATION OF SECTION 409A AMENDMENTS

December 28, 2008, if recognized, would affect the Company’s
annual effective tax rate. The Company conducts business and files
tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in
progress with a number of tax authorities. The U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) has completed its audit for the tax years through 2002.
In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business,
the years remain open generally back to the year 2002 with some
jurisdictions remaining open as far back as 1995. The Company does
not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will
significantly change over the next twelve months. The Company does
not expect a significant payment within the next twelve months, and
is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of
any future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions.

EX-99 17 y74152exv99.htm EX-99: CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
EXHIBIT 99
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM
ACT OF 1995 — “SAFE HARBOR” FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The Company may from time to time make certain forward-looking statements in publicly-released materials, both written and oral. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts
and anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other
words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations, financial performance, the Company’s strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approvals, market position
and expenditures.
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events. The Company cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be accurate, although the Company believes that it has been
reasonable in its expectations and assumptions. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the
Company’s expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Furthermore, the Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking
statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.
Some important factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ from the Company’s expectations in any forward-looking statements are as follows:
Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins;
Competitive factors, including technological advances achieved and patents attained by competitors as well as new products introduced by competitors;
Challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors or allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties, which could potentially affect the Company’s competitive position and
ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of past damages and future royalties. In particular, generic drug firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking to market generic forms
of most of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products, prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event that the Company is not successful in defending the resulting lawsuits,
generic versions of the product at issue will be introduced, resulting in very substantial market share and revenue losses;
Financial distress and bankruptcies experienced by significant customers and suppliers that could impair their ability, as the case may be, to purchase the Company’s products, pay for products previously
purchased or meet their obligations to the Company under supply arrangements;
Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of
physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of a prolonged global economic downturn.
The impact on political and economic conditions due to terrorist attacks in the U.S. and other parts of the world or U.S. military action overseas, as well as instability in the financial markets which could
result from such terrorism or military actions;
Interruptions of computer and communication systems, including computer viruses, that could impair the Company’s ability to conduct business and communicate internally and with its customers;
Health care changes in the U.S. and other countries resulting in pricing pressures, including the continued consolidation among health care providers, trends toward managed care and health care cost
containment, the shift towards governments becoming the primary payers of health care expenses and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion, reimbursement and pricing generally;Government laws and regulations, affecting U.S. and foreign operations, including those relating to securities laws compliance, trade, monetary and fiscal policies, taxes, price controls, regulatory approval
of new products, licensing and patent rights, and possible drug reimportation legislation;
Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant and results from time to time in product and process
obsolescence. The development of new and improved products is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business;
Challenges and difficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals in the
United States and abroad, gain and maintain market approval of products and the possibility of encountering infringement claims by competitors with respect to patent or other intellectual property rights which can
preclude or delay commercialization of a product;
Significant litigation adverse to the Company including product liability claims, patent infringement claims and antitrust claims;
The health care industry has come under increased scrutiny by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal
penalties, including debarment from government business;
Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the FDA (or foreign counterparts) or declining
sales;
The impact of business combinations, including acquisitions and divestitures, both internally for the Company and externally in the pharmaceutical, medical device and health care industries; and
Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact upon the Company’s ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not
possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company has identified the factors on this list as permitted by the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

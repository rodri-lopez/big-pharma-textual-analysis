PART I
Item 1. BUSINESS
General
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries have approximately 119,200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson & Johnson is a
holding company, which has more than 250 operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. Johnson & Johnson’s primary focus has been on products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was
incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.
The Company’s structure is based on the principle of decentralized management. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources of the
Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by
citizens of the country where it is located.
Segments of Business
Johnson & Johnson’s operating companies are organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the
narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of segments and operating results under the captions “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” on pages 36 through 47 and Note 11 “Segments
of Business and Geographic Areas” under “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” on page 59 of the Annual Report, filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.
Consumer
The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, skin care, oral care, wound care and women’s health care fields, as well as nutritional and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. Major brands include
AVEENO® skin care products; BAND-AID® Brand Adhesive Bandages; CAREFREE® Pantiliners; CLEAN & CLEAR® teen skin care products; JOHNSON’S® Baby and Adult lines of products; LISTERINE® oral care products; MOTRIN® IB
ibuprofen products; NEUTROGENA® skin and hair care products; RoC® skin care products; PEPCID® AC Acid Controller from Johnson & Johnson • Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co.; REMBRANDT® Brand of oral care products;
SPLENDA® No Calorie Sweetener; STAYFREE® sanitary protection products; SUDAFED® cold, flu and allergy products; the broad family of TYLENOL® acetaminophen products and Vendôme skin care product lines. These products are
marketed principally to the general public and sold both to wholesalers and directly to independent and chain retail outlets throughout the world.
Pharmaceutical
The Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following therapeutic areas: anti-infective, antipsychotic, cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology, gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management,
urology and virology. These products are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for prescription use by the general public. Key products in the Pharmaceutical segment include: RISPERDAL® oral (risperidone), a
medication that treats the symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar mania and irritability associated with autistic behavior in indicated patients, RISPERDAL® CONSTA® (risperidone), a long-acting injectable, and INVEGATM (paliperdone) Extended-
Release tablets, for the treatment of schizophrenia; REMICADE® (infliximab), a biologic approved for the treatment of Crohn’s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and use in the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis; PROCRIT® (Epoetin alfa, sold outside the U.S. as EPREX®), a biotechnology-derived product that stimulates red blood cell production; TOPAMAX® (topiramate), approved for adjunctive and monotherapy use in epilepsy, as well as for the
prophylactic treatment of migranes; LEVAQUIN® (levofloxacin) and FLOXIN® (ofloxacin), both in the anti-infective field; ACIPHEX®/PARIET®, a proton pump inhibitor co-marketed with Eisai Inc. DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl Transdermal
(fentanyl transdermal system, sold outside the U.S. as DUROGESIC®), a treatment for chronic pain that offers a novel delivery system; CONCERTA® (methylphenidate HCl), a product for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; and
ORTHO EVRA®Table of Contents
(norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol transdermal system), the first contraceptive patch approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).
Medical Devices and Diagnostics
The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of products distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic
laboratories and clinics. These products include Cordis’ circulatory disease management products; DePuy’s orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal care products; Ethicon’s wound care and women’s health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery’s
minimally invasive surgical products; LifeScan’s blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics’ professional diagnostic products and Vision Care’s disposable contact lenses. Distribution to these health care
professional markets is done both directly and through surgical supply and other dealers.
Geographic Areas
The international business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by subsidiaries located in 56 countries outside the United States, which are selling products in virtually all countries throughout the world. The products made and sold in the
international business include many of those described above under “— Segments of Business — Consumer,” “— Pharmaceutical” and “— Medical Devices and Diagnostics.” However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in
the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include not only those developed in the United States, but also those developed by subsidiaries abroad.
Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive economic policies and political
uncertainties.
Raw Materials
Raw materials essential to Johnson & Johnson’s operating companies’ businesses are generally readily available from multiple sources.
Patents and Trademarks
Johnson & Johnson and its operating companies have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own or are licensed under a number of patents relating to its products and
manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to Johnson & Johnson in the operation of its businesses. Sales of the Company’s two largest products, RISPERDAL® and REMICADE®, accounted for
approximately 6% and 5% of Johnson & Johnson’s total revenues, respectively, for fiscal 2007. Accordingly, the patents related to these products are believed to be material to Johnson & Johnson as a whole.
During 2004 through 2006, DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl Transdermal (fentanyl transdermal system) lost its basic patent protection and is subject to generic competition in the United States and certain international markets, and the basic
patents covering EPREX® (Epoetin alfa) have expired and increased biosimilar competition in international markets is expected. DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl Transdermal sales declined by 10.1% to $1.2 billion in 2007 as compared to 2006, due to the
impact of generic competition. Combined sales of DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl Transdermal and EPREX® accounted for approximately 4% of Johnson & Johnson’s worldwide sales in 2007. The material patents that expired in 2007 or will expire in
2008 are related to RISPERDAL®, which expired in the United States in December 2007, and TOPAMAX®, which is scheduled to expire in the United States in September 2008. The Company has received a pediatric extension for RISPERDAL®
oral from the FDA, which grants market exclusivity in the United States through June 2008. The Company is on target to file for a pediatric extension for TOPAMAX®, which, if obtained from the FDA, would grant market exclusivity in the United
States until March 2009.
2Table of Contents
Johnson & Johnson’s operating companies have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the United
States and other countries where such products are marketed. Johnson & Johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.
Seasonality
Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and
research and development activity.
Competition
In all of their product lines, Johnson & Johnson’s operating companies compete with companies both large and small, located throughout the world. Competition is strong in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the
competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and improved products is important to
Johnson & Johnson’s success in all areas of its businesses. This also includes protecting the Company’s portfolio of intellectual property. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and multiple sales forces.
In addition, the development and maintenance of customer acceptance of the products of Johnson & Johnson’s consumer businesses involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
Research and Development
Research activities represent a significant part of Johnson & Johnson’s subsidiaries’ businesses. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States but also in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany,
India, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom. The costs of worldwide Company-sponsored research activities relating to the development of new products, improvement of existing products, technical support of products and
compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of consumers and patients, excluding in-process research and development charges, amounted to $7,680 million, $7,125 million and $6,462 million for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. These costs are charged directly to income in the year in which incurred.
Environment
Johnson & Johnson’s operating companies are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental protection measures. Johnson & Johnson believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental
laws and regulations. Johnson & Johnson’s compliance with these requirements did not during the past year, and is not expected to, have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.
Regulation
Most of Johnson & Johnson’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation. In the United States,
the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad
regulatory powers by the FDA continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are
also evident in major markets outside of the United States.
The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the United States, attention has been focused on drug prices
and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Payers have become a more potent force in the market
3Table of Contents
place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care. In the United States, implementation of the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 may cause uncertainty in reimbursement levels in certain product segments.
The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson & Johnson’s operating companies operate have administrative powers that may subject those companies to such actions as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other
civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, Johnson & Johnson’s operating companies may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.
In addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the United States, by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk
of significant civil and criminal penalties.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The information set forth in Note 18 “Legal Proceedings” under “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” on pages 66 through 72 of the Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on
Form 10-K.
The Company or its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state laws, in which the
primary relief sought is the cost of past and future remediation. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in the opinion of the Company, such proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on the results
of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.

Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
Not applicable.
Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
William C. Weldon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dominic J. Caruso, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Weldon and Caruso concluded that, as of the end of the period
covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the
reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2007. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework.” These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring.
The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting.
Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December 30, 2007, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2007 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which
appears in the “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” on page 75 of the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference and filed as Exhibit 13 to this Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended December 30, 2007, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of
such referred to above in this Item 9A that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Organization and Business Segments
DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS
Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) have approximately 119,200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts
business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. The Consumer segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, skin care, oral care, wound care and women’s
health care fields, as well as nutritional and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. These products are marketed principally to the general public and sold both to wholesalers and directly to independent and chain retail outlets throughout the world. The
Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following therapeutic areas: anti-infective, antipsychotic, cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology, gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management, urology and virology.
These products are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for prescription use by the general public. The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of products used principally in the professional fields
by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and clinics. These products include Cordis’ circulatory disease management products; DePuy’s orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal care products; Ethicon’s wound care and women’s
health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery’s minimally invasive surgical products; LifeScan’s blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics’ professional diagnostic products and Vision Care’s disposable contact lenses.
The Company’s structure is based upon the principle of decentralized management. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This
Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics business segments. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with some exceptions, managed by citizens of the country where it
is located.
In all of its product lines, the Company competes with companies both large and small, located throughout the world. Competition is strong in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in
research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and improved products is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business. This also
includes protecting the Company’s portfolio of intellectual property. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and multiple sales forces. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer acceptance of the
Company’s consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.
MANAGEMENT’S OBJECTIVES
A primary objective of the Company is to achieve superior levels of capital efficient profitable growth. To accomplish this, the Company’s management operates the business consistent with certain strategic principles that have proven successful over time. To
this end, the Company participates in growth areas in human health care and is committed to attaining leadership positions in these growth segments through the development of innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five
years accounted for approximately 30% of 2007 sales. In 2007, $7.7 billion, or 12.6% of sales was invested in research and development, an increase of $0.6 billion over 2006. This increase reflects management’s commitment to the importance of on-going
development of new and differentiated products and services to sustain long-term growth.
With more than 250 operating companies located in 57 countries, the Company views its principle of decentralized management as an asset and fundamental to the success of a broadly based business. It also fosters an entrepreneurial spirit, combining the
extensive resources of a large organization with the ability to react quickly to local market changes and challenges.
The Company is committed to developing global business leaders who can drive growth objectives. Businesses are managed for the long term in order to sustain leadership positions and achieve growth that provides an enduring source of value to our
shareholders.
Unifying the management team and the Company’s dedicated employees in achieving these objectives is Our Credo. Our Credo provides a common set of values and serves as a constant reminder of the Company’s responsibilities to its customers,
employees, communities and shareholders. The Company believes that these basic principles, along with its overall mission of improving the quality of life for people everywhere, will enable Johnson & Johnson to continue to be among the leaders in the health
care industry.
Results of Operations
ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED SALES
In 2007, worldwide sales increased 14.6% to $61.1 billion, compared to increases of 5.6% in 2006 and 6.7% in 2005. These sales increases consisted of the following:
Sales increase due to: 2007 2006 2005
Volume 10.1% 3.8 5.4
Price 1.4 1.5 0.6
Currency 3.1 0.3 0.7

Sales by U.S. companies were $32.4 billion in 2007, $29.8 billion in 2006 and $28.4 billion in 2005. This represents an increase of 9.0% in 2007, 4.9% in 2006 and 2.2% in 2005. Sales by international companies were $28.7 billion in 2007, $23.5 billion in 2006
and $22.1 billion in 2005. This represents an increase of 21.7% in 2007, 6.4% in 2006 and 13.1% in 2005.
36 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2007 ANNUAL REPORT(BAR CHART)
The five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 11.0%, 7.6% and 15.7%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 10.5%, 10.6% and 10.3%,
respectively.
(BAR CHART)
All international geographic regions experienced sales growth during 2007, consisting of 22.4% in Europe, 32.2% in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) and 15.3% in the Asia-Pacific, Africa regions. These sales increases include the impact of
currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, which had positive impacts of 9.2% in Europe, 6.7% in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) and 3.5% in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region.
The acquisition of Pfizer Inc.’s Consumer Healthcare business, net of the related divestitures, increased both total sales growth and operational growth by 7.4%.
In 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company did not have a customer that represented 10% or more of total revenues.

Analysis of Sales by Business Segments
CONSUMER SEGMENT
Consumer segment sales in 2007 were $14.5 billion, an increase of 48.3%, over 2006 with 44.2% of this change due to operational growth and the remaining 4.1% due to positive currency fluctuations. U.S. Consumer segment sales were $6.4 billion, an
increase of 40.1%. International sales were $8.1 billion, an increase of 55.5%, with 47.8% as a result of operations and 7.7% due to currency fluctuations over 2006.
The acquisition of Pfizer Inc.’s Consumer Healthcare business, net of the related divestitures, increased both total sales growth and operational growth for the total Consumer segment by 40.3%.
The Over-the-Counter (OTC) Pharmaceuticals and Nutritionals franchise sales were $5.1 billion, an increase of 87.5% from 2006. This was attributable to new products from acquisitions, as well as strong sales growth achieved by analgesics and
SPLENDA® products. The positive impact on OTC Pharmaceuticals and Nutritionals total sales growth due to newly acquired brands from Pfizer Inc. was 80.0% for the fiscal year 2007.
In 2007, the Company announced a voluntary withdrawal of certain infant cough and cold products from the market. When used as directed, these medicines have been generally recognized as safe and effective. However, an assessment of available data
on the use of pediatric cough and cold medicines has identified rare instances of misuse leading to overdose, particularly in infants under two years of age. As well, these products, along with children’s cough and cold products generally, were the subject of a
recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Nonprescription Drug Advisory Committee hearing, which recommended to the FDA certain changes in the marketing and

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 37sale of such products. These actions are not expected to have a significant impact on sales for the OTC Pharmaceuticals and Nutritionals franchise.
The Skin Care franchise sales in 2007 were $3.1 billion, representing an increase of 15.9% over 2006. The increase was primarily due to sales growth in the suncare, CLEAN & CLEAR®, AVEENO® and NEUTROGENA® product lines, as well as new
products related to acquisitions. The positive impact on Skin Care total sales growth due to newly acquired brands from Pfizer Inc. was 5.7% for the fiscal year 2007.
The Baby Care franchise sales grew by 13.9% to $2.0 billion in 2007. This strong growth was led by the success of the cleanser, haircare, lotion and cream and powder product lines. An additional contributor to the growth were the new products related to
acquisitions. The positive impact on Baby Care total sales growth due to newly acquired brands from Pfizer Inc. and divestitures related to the acquisition was 1.8% for the fiscal year 2007.
The Women’s Health franchise sales grew by 8.4% to $1.8 billion in 2007. This growth was primarily due to newly acquired brands from Pfizer Inc. The positive impact on Women’s Health total sales growth due to newly acquired brands from Pfizer Inc. was
4.8% for the fiscal year 2007.
The Oral Care franchise sales grew by 266.5% to $1.5 billion in 2007. This strong sales growth was attributable to new products from acquisitions and newly launched products, such as LISTERINE® mouthwashes and dissolvable whitening strips. The
positive impact on Oral Care total sales growth due to newly acquired brands from Pfizer Inc. and divestitures related to the acquisition was 276.6%.
Consumer segment sales in 2006 were $9.8 billion, an increase of 7.5%, over 2005 with operational growth accounting for 6.4% of the total growth and 1.1% due to positive currency fluctuations. U.S. Consumer segment sales were $4.6 billion, an increase
of 3.8%. International sales were $5.2 billion, an increase of 10.9%, with 8.7% as a result of operations and 2.2% due to currency fluctuations over 2005.
PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT
Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2007 were $24.9 billion, an increase of 6.9% over 2006, with 4.3% of this change due to operational growth and the remaining 2.6% increase related to the positive impact of currency fluctuations. U.S. Pharmaceutical segment
sales were $15.6 billion, an increase of 3.4%. International Pharmaceutical segment sales were $9.3 billion, an increase of 13.3%, which included 5.9% of operational growth and 7.4% related to the positive impact of currency fluctuations.
The Antipsychotics franchise achieved sales of $4.7 billion in 2007, an increase of 12.3% over prior year. The Antipsychotics franchise includes RISPERDAL® oral (risperidone), a medication that treats the symptoms of schizophrenia, bipolar mania and
irritability associated with autistic behavior in indicated patients, RISPERDAL® CONSTA® (risperidone) a long acting injectable and INVEGA™ (paliperdone) Extended-Release tablets for the treatment of schizophrenia. Sales growth was positively impacted by
the continued global success of RISPERDAL® CONSTA®. The patent for the RISPERDAL® compound expired in the U.S. and most major markets outside the U.S. in 2007. In March 2007, the FDA granted pediatric exclusivity for RISPERDAL®, which extends
the marketing exclusivity in the U.S. for RISPERDAL® oral to the end of June 2008. In 2007, U.S. sales of RISPERDAL® oral were $2.2 billion. Loss of market exclusivity for RISPERDAL® oral is likely to result in a significant reduction in sales in the U.S.
REMICADE® (infliximab), a biologic approved for the treatment of Crohn’s disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis and use in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, achieved sales of $3.3 billion in 2007, with growth of
10.4% over prior year. Growth was driven by increased demand due to expanded indications and overall market growth. During 2007, REMICADE® received approval from the European Commission for pediatric Crohn’s disease indications. REMICADE® is
competing in a market which is experiencing increased competition due to new entrants and the expansion of indications for existing competitors.
PROCRIT® (Epoetin alfa) and EPREX® (Epoetin alfa) had combined sales of $2.9 billion in 2007, a decline of 9.3% compared to prior year. The decline was primarily due to the declining markets for Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs). Earlier in the
year The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid issued a National Coverage Determination, which significantly limits the reimbursement of ESAs in oncology in the U.S. Epoetin alfa products in the U.S. were subject to a label change, which may negatively impact
future sales. The label for Epoetin alfa products is also under review in jurisdictions outside the U.S.

38 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2007 ANNUAL REPORTTOPAMAX® (topiramate), which has been approved for adjunctive and monotherapy use in epilepsy, as well as for the prophylactic treatment of migraines, achieved $2.5 billion in sales in 2007, an increase of 21.0% over prior year. The major contributor to
the growth was the continued success in the migraine category. The patent for TOPAMAX® (topiramate) in the U.S. will expire in September 2008. The Company is on target to file for the pediatric extension with the FDA, which if obtained, would grant market
exclusivity in the U.S. until March 2009. In 2007, U.S. sales of TOPAMAX® were $2.0 billion. The expiration of a product patent or loss of market exclusivity is likely to result in a significant reduction in sales.
LEVAQUIN® (levofloxacin) and FLOXIN® (ofloxacin) achieved combined sales of $1.6 billion in 2007, representing growth of 7.6% over the prior year. This was primarily due to favorable market growth partially offset by increased competitive pressure. In
March 2007 the FDA granted pediatric exclusivity in the U.S. for LEVAQUIN®, which will extend the marketing exclusivity by six months to June 2011.
ACIPHEX®/PARIET® (rabeprazole sodium), a proton pump inhibitor co-marketed with Eisai Co. Ltd., achieved sales of $1.4 billion in 2007, an increase of 9.5% as compared to prior year. Growth in the U.S. was due to overall market growth. Growth outside
the U.S. was due to market growth partially offset by increased competition in certain regions.
DURAGESIC®/Fentanyl Transdermal (fentanyl transdermal system) sales declined to $1.2 billion in 2007, a reduction of 10.1% from 2006. This decline was the result of the impact of generic competition in the U.S. and major international markets. Generic
competition in the U.S. began in January 2005.
CONCERTA® (methylphenidate HCI), a product for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, achieved sales of $1.0 billion in 2007, representing an increase of 10.5% over 2006. Although the original CONCERTA® patent expired in 2004, the
FDA has not approved any generic version that is substitutable for CONCERTA®. Two parties have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) for generic versions of CONCERTA®, which are pending and may be approved at any time.
The hormonal contraceptive franchise sales declined to $0.9 billion in 2007, a reduction of 9.0% from 2006. ORTHO EVRA® (norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol), the first contraceptive patch approved by the FDA, experienced a significant decline in sales as a
result of labeling changes and negative media coverage concerning product safety. The sales decline was also a result of continued generic competition in oral contraceptives.
In 2007, Other Pharmaceutical sales were $5.4 billion, representing a growth of 10.9% over prior year. The biggest contributor to the increase was VELCADE®, a product for the treatment of multiple myeloma.
In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a special pre-tax, non-cash charge of $678 million for the write-down of the intangible asset related to NATRECOR® (nesiritide), a product for the treatment of patients with acutely decompensated
heart failure who have dyspnea at rest or with minimal activity. This charge results from revised estimates of future cash flows from this product primarily due to a recent decline in NATRECOR® sales trends. The remaining unamortized intangible value
associated with NATRECOR® was $200 million at the end of 2007. The Company believes that NATRECOR® is an important clinical option for the treatment of acutely decompensated heart failure and the product will continue to be marketed by Scios Inc., a
subsidiary of the Company.
During 2007, the Company launched INVEGA™ (paliperidone) Extended-Release Tablets, in both the U.S. and Europe. Additionally, in 2007 the Company launched the antibacterial, DORIBAX™ (doripenem for injection) in the U.S. and the antiretroviral,
PREZISTA™ (darunavir), in Europe. The Company submitted five new molecular entities for approval: paliperidone palmitate for schizophrenia in the U.S., ustekinumab, or CNTO 1275, for psoriasis in both the U.S. and Europe, dapoxetine for premature
ejaculation in several countries in Europe, antibacterial ceftobiprole in the U.S. and Europe and anti-HIV medication, TMC 125 in the U.S. and Europe. TMC 125 was approved by the U.S. FDA in January 2008 and will be marketed as INTELENCE™ (etravirine).
In response to the challenges facing the Pharmaceutical segment the Company announced a restructuring initiative in 2007. See Note 22 for additional information regarding the restructuring.
Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2006 were $23.2 billion, an increase of 4.2% over 2005, with 3.9% of this change due to operational growth and the remaining 0.3% increase related to the positive impact of currency. U.S. Pharmaceutical segment sales
were $15.1 billion, an increase of 4.2%. International Pharmaceutical segment sales were $8.1 billion, an increase of 4.2%, which included 3.4% of operational growth and 0.8% related to the positive impact of currency.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 39year of 7.2%, with operational growth of 3.9% and 3.3% due to a positive impact from currency fluctuations. U.S. sales were $10.4 billion, an increase of 3.2%. International sales were $11.3 billion, an increase of 11.1%, with 4.6% from operations and a positive
currency impact of 6.5%.
The DePuy franchise achieved $4.6 billion in sales in 2007, which was an 11.7% increase over prior year. This growth was primarily due to DePuy’s orthopaedic joint reconstruction products including the hip and knee product lines. Strong performance was
also achieved in Mitek’s sports medicine products.
The Ethicon Endo-Surgery franchise achieved sales of $3.8 billion in 2007, a 13.6% increase over 2006. A major contributor of growth continues to be endocutter sales, which include products used in performing bariatric procedures for the treatment of
obesity, an important focus area for the franchise. Strong results were achieved with the continued success of the HARMONIC SCALPEL®, an ultrasonic cutting and coagulating surgical device. There was also strong growth in the Advanced Sterilization
Products line.
The Ethicon franchise sales grew 11.8% in 2007, achieving $3.6 billion in sales. This was a result of solid growth in the hemostasis, women’s health, biosurgicals, and the mesh product lines. There was also continued growth in suture sales.
Sales in the Cordis franchise were $3.4 billion, a decline of 16.2% over 2006. This decline reflects lower sales of the CYPHER® Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent due to increased competition outside the U.S., as well as the global contraction of the drug-
eluting stent market following reports of a potential risk of late stent thrombosis associated with the use of drug-eluting stents. These results were partially offset by strong performance by the Biosense Webster and the neurovascular businesses. In response to
challenges facing the Cordis franchise the Company announced a restructuring initiative in 2007. See Note 22 for additional information regarding the restructuring.
On June 13, 2007, the FDA notified Cordis that all items outlined in the Warning Letters received in April and July 2004 regarding Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and Good Clinical Practice regulations have been resolved.
The LifeScan franchise achieved $2.4 billion in sales in 2007, an increase of 14.4% over 2006, reflecting the continued success of the ULTRA® product lines. An additional contributor was the growth of the Animas business due to the launch of the 2020
insulin pump during the year.
The Vision Care franchise achieved sales of $2.2 billion in 2007, a growth rate of 17.6% over the prior year. This growth was led by the continued success of such brands as ACUVUE® OASYS™, ACUVUE® ADVANCE™ for ASTIGMATISM, ACUVUE®
ADVANCE™, 1-DAY ACUVUE® MOIST™, 1-DAY ACUVUE® DEFINE™ and 1-DAY ACUVUE® for ASTIGMATISM.
The Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics franchise achieved $1.6 billion in sales in 2007, a 10.3% increase over 2006. This is due to the continued global growth in the Immunohematology product line, as well as the growth in the Immunodiagnostic product line and the
2007 launch of the Chagas screening assay in the U.S.
The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment achieved sales of $20.3 billion in 2006, representing an increase over the prior year of 6.2%, with operational growth of 6.4% and a negative impact from currency of 0.2%. U.S. sales were $10.1 billion, an
increase of 6.5%. International sales were $10.2 billion, an increase of 5.9%, with 6.2% from operations and a negative currency impact of 0.3%.
Analysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income
Consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income decreased by $1.3 billion to $13.3 billion in 2007 as compared to the $14.6 billion earned in 2006. Lower earnings in 2007 were primarily due to restructuring charges and the write-down of the
NATRECOR® intangible asset. The increase in 2006 was 11.2% over the $13.1 billion in 2005. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income in 2007 was 21.7% versus 27.4% in 2006. The sections that follow highlight the
significant components of the changes in consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income.
Cost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses: Cost of products sold and selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percent to sales were as follows:
% of Sales 2007 2006 2005
Cost of products sold 29.1% 28.2 27.7
Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year 0.9 0.5 (0.8)
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses 33.5 32.7 34.1
Percent point increase/(decrease) over the prior year 0.8 (1.4) (0.1)
In 2007, there was an increase in the percent to sales of cost of products sold primarily due to the impact of newly acquired consumer brands. There was an increase in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2007 primarily
due to the impact of newly acquired consumer brands partially offset by cost containment efforts.
In 2006, there was an increase in the percent to sales of cost of products sold. This was due to unfavorable product mix and higher manufacturing costs in the Pharmaceutical and Consumer segments. There was a decrease in the percent to sales of selling,
marketing and administrative expenses in 2006. This was a result of leveraging selling expenses and a reduction in advertising and promotional spending.
In 2005, there was a decrease in the percent to sales of cost of products sold. This was due to lower manufacturing costs primarily related to the CYPHER® Sirolimus-eluting Coronary Stent, as well as ongoing cost containment activity across the
organization, partially offset by the negative impact of pharmaceutical product mix. There was also a decrease in the percent to sales of selling, marketing and administrative expenses. This was due to cost containment initiatives in the Pharmaceutical segment
partially offset by increases in investment spending in the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment.
Research and Development: Research and development activities represent a significant part of the Company’s business. These expenditures relate to the development of new products, improvement of existing products, technical support of products and
compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of consumers and patients. Worldwide costs of research

Percent of sales 12.6% 13.4 12.8
Research and development expense as a percent of sales for the Pharmaceutical segment was 21.2% for 2007, 21.3% for 2006 and 20.2% for 2005. Research and development expense as a percent of sales for the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment
was 8.5% for 2007, 8.7% for 2006 and 8.2% for 2005. Research and development expense as a percent of sales for the Consumer segment was 3.9% for 2007, 4.0% for 2006 and 4.2% for 2005.
Research and development activities in the Pharmaceutical segment increased to $5.3 billion, or 6.1%, over 2006. The compound annual growth rate was approximately 13.8% for the five-year period since 2002.
The increased investment in research and development in all segments demonstrates the Company’s focus on knowledge-based products, and reflects a significant number of projects in late-stage development.
Restructuring: In 2007, the Company announced initiatives that are expected to generate pre-tax, annual cost savings of $1.3–$1.6 billion for 2008 in an effort to improve its overall cost structure. The Company recorded $745 million in related pre-tax charges.
This action was taken to offset the anticipated negative impacts associated with generic competition in the Pharmaceutical segment and challenges in the drug-eluting stent market.
The Company’s Pharmaceuticals segment will reduce its cost base by consolidating certain operations, while continuing to invest in recently launched products and its late-stage pipeline of new products. The Cordis franchise is moving to a more integrated
business model to address the market changes underway with drug-eluting stents and to better serve the broad spectrum of its patients’ cardiovascular needs, while reducing its cost base. This program will allow the Company to accelerate steps to standardize
and streamline certain aspects of its enterprise-wide functions such as human resources, finance and information technology to support growth across the business, while also leveraging its scale more effectively in areas such as procurement to benefit its
operating companies. See Note 22 for more details.
In-Process Research and Development: In 2007, the Company recorded a charge for in-process research and development (IPR&D) of $807 million before and after tax related to the acquisition of Conor Medsystems Inc. The IPR&D charge was included in
the operating profit of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment.
In 2006, the Company recorded IPR&D charges of $559 million before tax related to the acquisitions of the Consumer Health-care business of Pfizer Inc., Vascular Control Systems, Inc., Ensure Medical, Inc., ColBar LifeScience Ltd., Hand Innovations LLC
and Future Medical Systems S.A. The Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. accounted for $320 million before tax of the IPR&D charges and was included in the operating profit of the Consumer segment. The IPR&D charges for all of the following
acquisitions were included in the operating profit of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment. Vascular Control Systems, Inc., a privately held company focused on developing medical devices to treat fibroids and to control bleeding in obstetric and
gynecologic applications, accounted for $87 million before tax of the IPR&D charges. Ensure Medical, Inc., a privately held company that develops devices for post-catheterization closure of the femoral artery, accounted for $66 million before tax of the IPR&D
charges. ColBar LifeScience Ltd., a privately held company specializing in reconstructive medicine and tissue engineering, accounted for $49 million before tax of the IPR&D charges. Hand Innovations LLC, a privately held manufacturer of fracture fixation
products for the upper extremities, accounted for $22 million before tax of the IPR&D charges. Future Medical Systems S.A., a privately held company that primarily develops, manufactures and markets arthroscopic fluid management systems, accounted for
$15 million before tax of the IPR&D charges.
In 2005, the Company recorded IPR&D charges of $362 million before tax related to the acquisitions of TransForm Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Closure Medical Corporation, Peninsula Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and the international commercial rights to certain
patents and know-how in the field of sedation and analgesia from Scott Lab, Inc. TransForm Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a company specializing in the discovery of superior formulations and novel crystalline forms of drug molecules, accounted for $50 million before
tax of the IPR&D charges and was included in the operating profit of the Pharmaceutical segment. Closure Medical Corporation, a company with expertise and intellectual property in the biosurgicals market, accounted for $51 million before tax of the IPR&D
charges and was included in the operating profit of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment. Peninsula Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing antibiotics to treat life-threatening infections,
accounted for $252 million before tax of the IPR&D charges and was included in the operating profit of the Pharmaceutical segment. The $9 million before tax IPR&D charge related to Scott Lab, Inc. referred to above was included in the operating profit of the
Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment.
Other (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net includes gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation, gains and losses on the disposal of
property, plant and equipment, currency gains and losses, minority interests, litigation settlements and liabilities and royalty income. The change in other (income) expense, net from 2007 to 2006 was an increase in expense of $1,205 million.
In 2007, other (income) expense, net included a charge of $678 million before tax related to the NATRECOR® intangible asset write-down. A gain of $622 million associated with the Guidant acquisition agreement termination fee, less associated expenses,
was included in 2006. In addition, 2006 also included expenses associated with the recording of additional product liability reserves and the integration costs associated with the acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc.
In 2005, other (income) expense, net included royalty income partially offset by several expense items, none of which were individually significant.

(BAR GRAPH)
Consumer Segment: In 2007, Consumer segment operating profit increased 65.7% from 2006. As a percent to sales, 2007 operating profit increased to 15.7%. IPR&D expenses of $320 million as well as expenses associated with the Consumer Healthcare
business of Pfizer Inc. integration were recorded during 2006. In 2006, Consumer segment operating profit decreased 13.7% and as a percent to sales declined to 14.1% over the prior year resulting from $320 million of IPR&D expenses as well as expenses
associated with the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. integration recorded during 2006.
Pharmaceutical Segment: In 2007, Pharmaceutical segment operating profit decreased 5.1% from 2006. As a percent to sales, 2007 operating profit decreased to 26.3% resulting from $429 million of restructuring charges and $678 million for the
NATRECOR® intangible asset write-down in 2007. In 2006, Pharmaceutical segment operating profit increased 8.3% and as a percent to sales increased to 29.6% over the prior year. This increase was the result of $302 million of IPR&D recorded during 2005
partially offset by increases in research and development spending and lower gross margins in 2006.
Medical Devices and Diagnostics Segment: In 2007, the operating profit in the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment decreased 20.9% from 2006. As a percent to sales, 2007, operating profit decreased to 22.3% resulting from $807 million of IPR&D
expenses and $301 million of restructuring charges in 2007, while 2006 included the gain associated with the Guidant acquisition agreement termination fee, less associated expenses, of $622 million. In 2006, the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment
operating profit increased 16.9% and as a percent to sales increased 2.8% over the prior year. The primary driver of the improved operating profit was the Guidant acquisition agreement termination fee, less associated expenses, of $622 million recorded during
2006. This was partially offset by higher IPR&D charges of $239 million in 2006 versus $60 million in 2005. In addition, advertising and promotional expense leveraging were offset in part by increases in research and development spending.
Interest (Income) Expense: Interest income in 2007 decreased by $377 million due to a lower average cash balance. The decline in the average cash balance was due primarily to the acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. on
December 20, 2006. The cash balance, including marketable securities was $9.3 billion at the end of 2007, and averaged $6.6 billion as compared to the $15.7 billion average cash balance in 2006.
Interest expense in 2007 increased by $233 million due to a higher average debt balance. The net debt balance at the end of 2007 was $9.5 billion as compared to $6.6 billion at the end of 2006. The higher debt balance in 2007 was due to the debt
associated with the acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. and the Common Stock repurchase program in 2007.
Interest income in 2006 increased by $342 million due primarily to higher rates of interest, as well as a higher average cash balance, despite the $5.0 billion Common Stock repurchase program and an increase in acquisition activity as compared to prior
year. The cash balance, including current marketable securities was $4.1 billion at the end of 2006 and averaged $15.7 billion, as compared to the $14.3 billion average cash balance in 2005.
Interest expense in 2006 increased slightly as compared to 2005 due to a higher average debt balance, from $2.6 billion in 2005 to $3.1 billion in 2006. This was partially offset by a decrease in interest rates.
Interest income in 2005 increased by $292 million due primarily to higher rates of interest, as well as a higher average cash balance. The cash balance, including current marketable securities, was $16.1 billion at the end of 2005 and averaged $14.3 billion,
as compared to the $11.3 billion average cash balance in 2004.
Provision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 20.4% in 2007, 24.2% in 2006 and 23.3% in 2005. The 2007 tax rate benefited from a one-time gain of $267 million related to an international business restructuring in certain
countries, as well as increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to taxable income in higher tax jurisdictions and lower international tax rates in certain countries. The 2006 tax rate increased as compared to 2005 primarily due to a gain of
$225 million recorded in 2005, which was partially offset by a benefit in 2006 related to the reversal of a tax allowance of $134 million associated with the international business. The 2005 effective tax rate benefited from the previously mentioned $225 million,
due to the reversal of a tax liability previously recorded during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2004, related to a technical correction to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
CASH FLOWS
In 2007, cash flow from operations was $15.2 billion, an increase of $1.0 billion over 2006. The $1.0 billion increase in cash flow from operations is primarily attributable to non-cash expenses associated with the NATRECOR® intangible asset write-down
42 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2007 ANNUAL REPORTand increased depreciation and amortization.
Net cash used by investing activities in 2007 was $6.1 billion versus $20.3 billion in 2006 which included the acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. For a more detailed discussion on mergers and acquisitions, see Note 17. There was
also a $1.6 billion net increase in purchases of investments, primarily marketable securities. Capital expenditures were $2.9 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Net cash used by financing activities decreased by $0.4 billion primarily due to a $1.1 billion decrease in the repurchase of Common Stock in 2007 and a $0.4 billion increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by $0.7 billion
decrease in proceeds from short and long-term debt. There was also a $0.4 billion increase in dividends to shareholders in 2007.
Cash and current marketable securities were $9.3 billion at the end of 2007 as compared with $4.1 billion at the end of 2006, primarily due to cash flow from operations.
Cash generated from operations amounted to $14.2 billion in 2006, which was $2.4 billion more than the cash generated from operations in 2005 of $11.8 billion. The major factors contributing to the increase were a net income increase of $1.2 billion, net of
the non-cash impact of IPR&D charges and a $2.7 billion increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. This was partially offset by a $0.9 billion increase in deferred taxes and a $0.8 billion increase in other current and non-current assets.
(BAR GRAPH)
FINANCING AND MARKET RISK
The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and
to hedge future foreign currency products costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 30, 2007 market rates would increase the unrealized
value of the Company’s forward contracts by $245 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 30, 2007 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $299 million. In either scenario,
the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and, therefore, would have no impact on future earnings and cash flows.
The Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on
the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $175 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be
offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future cash flows.
The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an “A” (or equivalent) credit rating. The counterparties to these
contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counter-party. Management believes the risk of loss is remote.
Total credit available to the Company approximates $8.0 billion, of which $6.4 billion expires September 25, 2008, and $1.6 billion expires September 27, 2012.
Total borrowings at the end of 2007 and 2006 were $9.5 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings between 2006 and 2007 was a result of financing general corporate purposes and the Common Stock repurchase program in 2007. In
2007, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $0.2 billion compared to net debt of $2.5 billion in 2006. Total debt represented 18.0% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2007 and 14.4% of total capital in 2006.
Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2007 was $15.25 compared with $13.59 at year-end 2006, an increase of 12.2%.
For the period ended December 30, 2007, there were no material cash commitments. Johnson & Johnson continues to be one of a few industrial companies with a Triple A credit rating. A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 6.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 43CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS
The Company has contractual obligations, primarily lease, debt obligations and unfunded retirement plans, with no other significant obligations. To satisfy these obligations, the Company will use cash from operations. The following table summarizes the
Company’s contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of December 30, 2007 (see Notes 4, 6 and 13 to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for further details):

SHARE REPURCHASE AND DIVIDENDS
On July 9, 2007, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program, authorizing the Company to buy back up to $10.0 billion of the Company’s Common Stock. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be
suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to fund the share repurchase program through a combination of available cash and debt. During 2007, the Company
repurchased an aggregate of 55.8 million shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock under the current repurchase program at a cost of $3.6 billion. In addition the Company has an annual program to repurchase shares for use in employee stock and
incentive plans.
The Company increased its dividend in 2007 for the 45th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $1.620 per share in 2007, compared with dividends of $1.455 per share in 2006 and $1.275 per share in 2005. The dividends were distributed as follows:
2007 2006 2005
First quarter $0.375 0.330 0.285
Second quarter 0.415 0.375 0.330
Third quarter 0.415 0.375 0.330
Fourth quarter 0.415 0.375 0.330
Total $1.620 1.455 1.275
On January 2, 2008, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.415 per share, payable on March 11, 2008, to shareholders of record as of February 26, 2008. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends.
Other Information
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The
preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these
estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue
recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock options.
Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and
discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, the largest being the Medicaid rebate provision, are
estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and
other third party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.
Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as
part of the accounting for sales return accruals.
Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to
gross sales.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of
consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are derived by estimating sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. Promotional arrangements
containing customer acceptance criteria are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred.
In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements, which contain multiple revenue generating activities. The revenue for these arrangements is recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative fair value. Upfront fees
received as part of these arrangements, for which no further performance obligations exist, are recognized as revenue on the earlier of receipt of payment or collection is assured. If performance obligations exist, the Company will defer the upfront fees and
recognize as earned over the obligation period.
44 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2007 ANNUAL REPORTReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in
the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a financial statement impact.
Below are tables which show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the years ended December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006.

The Company also earns service revenue for co-promotion of certain products. For all years presented, service revenues were less than 2% of total revenues and are included in sales to customers.
Income Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company
estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on current tax regulations and rates. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a
material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation 48 (FIN48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification and other matters. See Note 8 for further information regarding income taxes.
At December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the cumulative amounts of undistributed international earnings were approximately $24.2 billion and $17.9 billion, respectively. The Company intends to continue to reinvest its undistributed international
earnings to expand its international operations; therefore, no U.S. tax expense has been recorded to cover the undistributed portion not intended for repatriation.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 45Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies including legal proceedings and product liability cases as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as
to the probability of losses, opinions of legal counsel and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. Additionally, the Company records insurance receivable amounts from third-party insurers when recovery is probable. As appropriate, reserves against
these receivables are recorded for estimated amounts that may not be collected from third-party insurers.
Long-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible
assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.
Employee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, that cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the
discount rate, expected return on plan assets, expected salary increases and health care cost trend rates. See Note 13 for further detail on these rates and the effect a rate change would have on the Company’s results of operations.
Stock Options: During the fiscal first quarter of 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. The Company has applied the modified retrospective transition method to implement SFAS
No. 123(R). Previously reported financial statements have been restated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). See Note 10 for further information regarding stock options.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification and other matters. FIN 48 is effective for the
fiscal year 2007 and the Company adopted it in the first quarter of 2007.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. The statement is effective in the fiscal first quarter of 2008 except for non-financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, for which the effective date is fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The
Company believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal year 2008
and the Company will adopt accordingly. The Company is assessing the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 159 and currently does not believe that the adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, and No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. These statements aim to improve, simplify, and converge internationally the accounting for business
combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. These statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 141(R) will have a significant impact on the manner in which the
Company accounts for future acquisitions beginning in the fiscal year 2009. Significant changes include the capitalization of IPR&D, expensing of acquisition related restructuring actions and transaction related costs and the recognition of contingent purchase
price consideration at fair value at the acquisition date. The Company believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 will not have a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
EITF Issue 07-1: Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements Related to the Development and Commercialization of Intellectual Property. This issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. This issue
addresses the income statement classification of payments made between parties in a collaborative arrangement. The adoption of EITF 07-1 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
EITF Issue 07-3: Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities. This issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2007. This issue requires nonrefundable advance payments for research and development to be capitalized and recognized as an expense as related goods are delivered or services are performed. The adoption of EITF 07-3 is not expected to have a
significant impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
ECONOMIC AND MARKET FACTORS
The Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns, The Company has a
long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 1997-2007, in the United States, the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs,
hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).
Inflation rates, even though moderate in many parts of the world during 2007, continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit
margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases. The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government
legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement.
46 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2007 ANNUAL REPORTThe Company also operates in an environment which has become increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Generic drug firms have filed ANDAs seeking to market generic forms of most of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products, prior to
expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in ANDA filings, the generic firms will then introduce generic versions of the product at issue, resulting in the
potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for that product. For further information see the discussion on “Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications” in Note 18.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company is involved in numerous product liability cases in the United States, many of which concern adverse reactions to drugs and medical devices. The damages claimed are substantial, and while the Company is confident of the adequacy of the
warnings and instructions for use which accompany such products, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. However, the Company believes that if any liability results from such cases, it will be substantially covered by existing amounts
accrued in the Company’s balance sheet under its self-insurance program and by third-party product liability insurance.
The Company is also involved in a number of patent, trademark and other lawsuits, as well as investigations, incidental to its business. The ultimate legal and financial liability of the Company in respect to all claims, lawsuits and proceedings referred to
above cannot be estimated with any certainty. However, in the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities already accrued in the
Company’s balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the Company’s results of
operations and cash flows for that period.
See Note 18 for further information regarding legal proceedings.

Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results
This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and anticipate results based on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. Forward-looking statements may be
identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations, financial performance, the Company’s strategy for growth,
product development, regulatory approval, market position and expenditures.
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events. The Company cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be accurate, although the Company believes that it has been reasonable in its expectations and
assumptions. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or that unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the Company’s expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not
to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.
Risks and uncertainties include general industry conditions and competition; economic conditions, such as interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent
in new product development, including obtaining regulatory approvals; challenges to patents; U.S. and foreign health care reforms and governmental laws and regulations; trends toward health care cost containment; increased scrutiny of the health care
industry by government agencies; product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls or regulatory action.
The Company’s report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2007 includes, in Exhibit 99, a discussion of additional factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations. The Company notes these factors as permitted by the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 51Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and subsidiaries (the “Company”). Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.
DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company has approximately 119,200 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its
primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.
The Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices and Diagnostics. The Consumer segment manufactures and markets a broad range of products used in the baby care, skin care, oral care, wound
care and women’s health care fields, as well as nutritional and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products. These products are marketed principally to the general public and sold both to wholesalers and directly to independent and chain retail outlets throughout
the world. The Pharmaceutical segment includes products in the following therapeutic areas: anti-infective, antipsychotic, cardiovascular, contraceptive, dermatology, gastrointestinal, hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management, urology and
virology. These products are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers and health care professionals for prescription use by the general public. The Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of products used principally in the
professional fields by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories and clinics. These products include Cordis’ circulatory disease management products; DePuy’s orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal care products; Ethicon’s wound
care and women’s health products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery’s minimally invasive surgical products; LifeScan’s blood glucose monitoring and insulin delivery products; Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics’ professional diagnostic products and Vision Care’s disposable
contact lenses.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification and other matters. FIN 48 is effective for the
fiscal year 2007 and the Company adopted it in the first quarter of 2007.
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles,
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The statement is effective in the fiscal first quarter of 2008 except for non-financial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, for which the effective date is fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal year 2008
and the Company will adopt accordingly. The Company is assessing the impact of the adoption of SFAS No.159 and currently does not believe that the adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
In December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, and No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. These statements aim to improve, simplify, and converge internationally the accounting for business
combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements. These statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS No. 141(R) will have a significant impact on the manner in which the
Company accounts for future acquisitions beginning in the fiscal year 2009. Significant changes include the capitalization of IPR&D, expensing of acquisition related restructuring actions and transaction related costs and the recognition of contingent purchase
price consideration at fair value at the acquisition date. The Company believes that the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 will not have a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
EITF Issue 07-1: Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements Related to the Development and Commercialization of Intellectual Property. This issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. This issue
addresses the income statement classification of payments made between parties in a collaborative arrangement. The adoption of EITF 07-1 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
EITF Issue 07-3: Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities. This issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2007. This issue requires nonrefundable advance payments for research and development to be capitalized and recognized as an expense as related goods are delivered or services are performed. The adoption of EITF 07-3 is not expected to have a
significant impact on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers securities with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.
INVESTMENTS
Short-term marketable securities are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income. Long-term debt securities that the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity are carried at amortized cost, which also approximates fair value. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity
securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determi-
52 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2007 ANNUAL REPORTnation at each balance sheet date. The Company periodically reviews its investments in equity securities for impairment and adjusts these investments to their fair value when a decline in market value is deemed to be other than temporary.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets:
Building and building equipment 20-40 years
Land and leasehold improvements 10-20 years
Machinery and equipment 2-13 years
The Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the
estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3 to 5 years.
The Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When necessary, charges for impairments of long-lived assets are recorded for the amount by which the present value of future cash flows is less than the
carrying value of these assets.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the goods are shipped or delivered and title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, product returns and discounts to customers are
accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded.
Product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including prices charged by competitors. Rebates, the largest being the Medicaid rebate provision, are
estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and
other third party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.
Sales returns are generally estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as
part of the accounting for sales return accruals. Sales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The returns reserve is based on historical return trends
by product and by market as a percent to gross sales.
Promotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the year incurred. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of
consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. The Company also earns
service revenue for co-promotion of certain products and includes it in sales to customers. Promotional arrangements containing customer acceptance criteria are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred.
In addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements, which contain multiple revenue generating activities. The revenue for these arrangements is recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative fair value. Upfront fees
received as part of these arrangements, for which no further performance obligations exist, are recognized as revenue on the earlier of receipt of payment or collection is assured. If performance obligations exist, the Company will defer the upfront fees and
recognize as earned over the obligation period.
SHIPPING AND HANDLING
Shipping and handling costs incurred were $934 million, $693 million and $736 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less
than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined by the first-in, first-out method.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL
SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed the annual impairment test for 2007 in the fiscal fourth quarter and no impairment was determined. Future impairment
tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a triggering event occurs.
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 7 for further details on Intangible Assets.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. SFAS No. 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.
The Company uses forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany product and third party purchases of raw materials denominated in foreign
currency. The Company also uses currency swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both of these types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward exchange contracts to offset its exposure
to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the
related foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date into the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge and is highly
effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 53income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction. The fair value of a derivative instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contract, currency swap) is the aggregation, by
currency, of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate.
On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is
discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is included in current period earnings, and was insignificant in 2007, 2006 and 2005.
The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize
foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk
associated with financial institutions.
PRODUCT LIABILITY
Accruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. The accruals are adjusted periodically as
additional information becomes available. As a result of cost and availability factors, effective November 1, 2005, the Company ceased purchasing third-party product liability insurance. Based on the availability of prior coverage, receivables for insurance
recoveries related to product liability claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a recovery will be realized.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments
made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.
ADVERTISING
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in the selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which are comprised of television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were
$2.7 billion in 2007, $1.9 billion in 2006 and $2.1 billion in 2005.
INCOME TAXES
The Company intends to continue to reinvest its undistributed international earnings to expand its international operations; therefore, no U.S. tax expense has been recorded to cover the undistributed portion not intended for repatriation. At December 30, 2007
and December 31, 2006, the cumulative amount of undistributed international earnings were approximately $24.2 billion and $17.9 billion, respectively.
Deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates, applicable to future years, to differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities.
NET EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if
securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for
sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. For instance, in determining annual pension and post-employment
benefit costs, the Company estimates the rate of return on plan assets, and the cost of future health care benefits. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.
ANNUAL CLOSING DATE
The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years, the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks.
2. Inventories

The Company capitalizes interest expense as part of the cost of construction of facilities and equipment. Interest expense capitalized in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $130 million, $118 million and $111 million, respectively.
Depreciation expense, including the amortization of capitalized interest in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.Upon retirement or other disposal of property, plant and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation

The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. Total credit available to the Company approximates $8.0 billion of which $6.4 billion expire September 25, 2008, and $1.6 billion expire September 27, 2012. Interest
charged on borrowings under the credit line agreements is based on either bids provided by banks, the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are not material.
The Company filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission that became effective November 13, 2006 and which enables the Company to issue up to $10 billion in debt securities and warrants to purchase debt securities. The
Company issued bonds in August 2007 for a total of $2.6 billion and in November 2007 for a total of $2.4 billion for general corporate purposes and the Common Stock repurchase program in 2007. At December 30, 2007 the Company had $5.0 billion remaining
on the shelf registration.
On July 28, 2000, ALZA Corporation, a subsidiary of the Company completed a private offering of the 3% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Debentures, which were issued at a price of $551.26 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. At December 30,
2007 the outstanding 3% Debentures had a total principal amount at maturity of $258.8 million with a yield to maturity of 3% per annum, computed on a semiannual bond equivalent basis. There are no periodic interest payments. Under the terms of the 3%
debentures, holders are entitled to convert their debentures into approximately 15.0 million shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock at a price of $40.102 per share. Approximately 11.4 million shares have been issued as of December 30, 2007, due to
voluntary conversions by note holders. At the option of the holder, the 3% Debentures may be repurchased by the Company on July 28, 2008 or 2013, at a purchase price equal to the issue price plus accreted original issue discount to such purchase date. The
Company, at its option, may elect to deliver either Johnson & Johnson common stock or cash, or a combination of stock and cash, in the event of repurchase of the 3% Debentures. The Company, at its option, may also redeem any or all of the 3% Debentures
after July 28, 2003 at the issue price plus accreted original issue discount. At December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the fair value based on quoted market value of the 3% Debentures was $240.0 million and $250.7 million, respectively.
Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $2.5 billion at the end of 2007, of which $2.0 billion was raised under the Commercial Paper Program. The remainder represents principally local borrowing by
international subsidiaries.

Total intangible assets and goodwill — net $ 28,763 28,688
Goodwill as of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, as allocated by segment of business is as follows:
Med Dev
(Dollars in Millions) Consumer Pharm and Diag Total
Goodwill at January 1, 2006 $ 1,090 874 4,026 5,990

Translation/other 256 62 13 331
Goodwill at December 30, 2007 $ 8,125 964 5,034 14,123
The weighted average amortization periods for patents and trademarks and other intangible assets are 16 years and 28 years, respectively. The amortization expense of amortizable intangible assets for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2007, December 31,
2006 and January 1, 2006 was $844 million, $594 million and $521 million before tax, respectively. Certain patents and intangible assets were written down to fair value during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, with the resulting charge included in amortization
expense. The reduction in total patent and trademarks compared to 2006 is primarily due to a write-down of $678 million before tax, related to the NATRECOR® intangible asset. The remaining unamortized intangible value associated with NATRECOR® was
$200 million at the end of 2007. This charge results from revised estimates of future cash flows from this product due primarily to a recent decline in NATRECOR® sales trends. NATRECOR® will continue to be marketed by Scios Inc., a subsidiary of the
Company.
The estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years approximates $753 million before tax, per year. Substantially all of the amortization expense is included in cost of products sold.

The Company has subsidiaries manufacturing in Ireland under an incentive tax rate. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico under various tax incentive grants. Also, the U.S. possessions tax credit, which expired in 2006, applies to
certain operations in Puerto Rico. The decrease in the 2007 tax rate was mainly attributed to increases in taxable income in lower tax jurisdictions relative to taxable income in higher jurisdictions and lower international tax rates in certain countries. The
international tax rate also benefited from a business restructuring of certain international subsidiaries, resulting in a one-time benefit of $267 million, which reduced the effective tax rate by 2%.
56 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2007 ANNUAL REPORTThe increase in the 2006 tax rate was mainly due to the reversal of a tax liability of $225 million reported in the 2005 tax provision which resulted from a technical correction to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. This was partially offset by a benefit reported
in 2006 for the reversal of tax allowances of $134 million associated with the international business.

The Company adopted FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes effective January 1, 2007 which resulted in the recognition of an additional $19 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits, with the corresponding adjustment to retained
earnings. The Company had $1.3 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $1.1 billion net unrecognized tax benefits, as of January 1, 2007 including the previous adjustment mentioned above. The Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits
and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. During the year ended December 30, 2007 the Company recognized $42 million of interest
income and $58 million of interest expense, with an after-tax impact of $10 million. The total amount of accrued interest was $187 million and $171 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.
The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits:
(Dollars in Millions) Total
Balance as of January 1, 2007 $ 1,262
Increases related to current year tax positions 487
Increases related to prior period tax positions 77

Lapse of statute of limitations (42)
Balance as of December 30, 2007 $ 1,653
Included in the unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $1.7 billion at December 30, 2007, are $1.4 billion of potential tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s annual effective tax rate. The Company conducts business and files tax returns
in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed the audit for tax years through 1999; however, the years 1996 though 1999 remain open while a limited
number of issues are being considered at the IRS appeals level, which the Company expects to be resolved within the next twelve months. In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years remain open generally back to the year
2001 with some jurisdictions remaining open as far back as 1995. The Company does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change over the next twelve months. The Company does not expect a significant payment within
the next twelve months, and is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any future tax payments, relating to uncertain tax positions.
9. International Currency Translation
For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as
those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency.
In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. This equity account includes the results of translating all balance sheet assets and liabilities at current
exchange rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies. The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results.
An analysis of the changes during 2007, 2006 and 2005 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 12.
Net currency transaction and translation gains and losses included in other (income) expense were losses of $23 million, $18 million and $32 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
10. Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements
STOCK OPTIONS
At December 30, 2007, the Company had 15 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company’s 1995 and 2000 Stock Option Plans, the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the 2000 Stock Compensation Plan, the
1997 Non-Employee Director’s Plan and the Centocor, Innovasive Devices, ALZA, Inverness, and Scios Stock Option Plans. During 2007, no options or restricted shares were granted under any of these plans except under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The compensation cost recorded under SFAS No. 123(R) that has been charged against income for these plans was $698 million for 2007, $659 million for 2006 and $540 million for 2005. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for
share-based compensation costs was $238 million for 2007, $228 million for 2006 and $189 million for 2005. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods.
Stock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from six months to five
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 57years. All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Company’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. Under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 260 million shares of
Common Stock. Shares available for future grants under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 194.5 million at the end of 2007.
The Company settles employee stock option exercises with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee stock option exercises.
The fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. Starting in 2006, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 4-year daily
historical average volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. Prior to 2006, expected volatility was based on 5-year weekly historical volatility rate. Historical data is
used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
The average fair value of options granted was $11.67, $12.22 and $15.48 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of:
2007 2006 2005
Risk-free rate 4.78% 4.60% 3.72%
Expected volatility 14.7% 19.6% 25.0%
Expected life 6.0 yrs 6.0 yrs 5.0 yrs
Dividend yield 2.50% 2.50% 1.93%

relating to derivatives and hedging.
The currency translation adjustments are not currently adjusted for income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in international subsidiaries.
13. Pensions and Other Benefit Plans
The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides postretirement benefits, primarily health care, to
all U.S. retired employees and their dependents.
Many international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant.
Retirement plan benefits are primarily based on the employee’s compensation during the last three to five years before retirement and the number of years of service. International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees,
annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided.
The Company does not fund retiree health care benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the future.
The Company uses the date of its consolidated financial statements (December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively) as the measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.
In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans was issued and amends further the disclosure requirements for pensions and other
postretirement benefits. This Statement was an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). The incremental effect of applying FASB No. 158 was a $1.7 billion reduction in Shareholder’s Equity, net of deferred taxes.

The Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined using a building block approach, considering historical averages and real returns of each asset class. In certain countries, where historical returns are not meaningful,
consideration is given to local market expectations of long-term returns.

62 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2007 ANNUAL REPORTStrategic asset allocations are determined by country, based on the nature of the liabilities and considering the demographic composition of the plan participants (average age, years of service and active versus retiree status). The Company’s plans are
considered non-mature plans and the long-term strategic asset allocations are consistent with these types of plans. Emphasis is placed on diversifying equities on a broad basis combined with currency matching of the fixed income assets.

The Company was not required to fund its U.S. retirement plans in 2007 and is not required, nor does it anticipate funding in 2008 to meet minimum statutory funding requirements. International plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional
discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans. In certain countries other than the United States, the funding of pension plans is not a common practice as funding provides no economic benefit.
Consequently the Company has several pension plans which are not funded.
The following table displays the projected future minimum contributions to the Company’s U.S. and international unfunded retirement plans. These amounts do not include any discretionary contributions that the Company may elect to make in the future.

15. Financial Instruments
The Company follows the provisions of SFAS No. 133 requiring that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
As of December 30, 2007, the balance of deferred net losses on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $45 million after-tax. For additional information, see Note 12. The Company expects that substantially all of this amount
will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months. The amount ultimately realized
in earnings will differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative. Derivative gains/(losses), initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income, are
reclassified to earnings in the period when the forecasted transactions affect earnings.
For the years ended December 30, 2007, December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, the net impact of hedge ineffectiveness, transactions not qualifying for hedge accounting and discontinuance of hedges, to the Company’s financial statements was
insignificant.
Refer to Note 12 for disclosures of movements in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company invests its excess cash in both deposits with major banks throughout the world and other high-quality money market instruments. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an A
(or equivalent) credit rating. On average these investments mature within six months, and the Company has not incurred any related losses.
16. Savings Plan
The Company has voluntary 401(k) savings plans designed to enhance the existing retirement programs covering eligible employees. The Company matches a percentage of each employee’s contributions consistent with the provisions of the plan for which
he/she is eligible. Total Company matching contributions to the plans were $169 million in 2007, $158 million in 2006 and $148 million in 2005.
17. Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures
Certain businesses were acquired for $1,388 million in cash and $232 million of liabilities assumed during 2007. These acquisitions were accounted for by the purchase method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial
statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
The 2007 acquisitions included: Conor Medsystems, Inc., a cardiovascular device company, with new drug delivery technology; Robert Reid, Inc., a Japanese orthopedic product distributor and Maya’s Mom, Inc., a social media company.
The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $636 million and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill. Approximately $807 million has been identified
as the value of IPR&D associated with the acquisition of Conor Medsystems, Inc.
The IPR&D charge related to the acquisition of Conor Medsystems, Inc. was $807 million and is associated with research related to the discovery and application of the stent technology. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections
discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. The discount rate applied was 19%.
Certain businesses were acquired for $18.0 billion in cash and $1.3 billion of liabilities assumed during 2006. These acquisitions were accounted for by the purchase method and, accordingly, results of Operations have been included in the financial
statements from their respective dates of acquisition except as noted below.
On December 20, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. for a purchase price of $16.6 billion in cash. The operating results of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. were reported in the
Company’s financial statements beginning in 2007, as 2006 results subsequent to the acquisition date were not significant.
In order to obtain regulatory approval of the transaction, the Company agreed to divest certain overlapping businesses. The Company completed the divestiture of the ZANTAC® product on December 20, 2006 and the divestitures of KAOPECTATE®,
UNISOM®, CORTIZONE ®, BALMEX ® and ACT® products on January 2, 2007.
The following table provides pro forma results of operations for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2006 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, as if the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. had been acquired as of the beginning of each
64 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2007 ANNUAL REPORTperiod presented. The pro forma results include the effect of divestitures and certain purchase accounting adjustments such as the estimated changes in depreciation and amortization expense on the acquired tangible and intangible assets. However, pro forma
results do not include any anticipated cost savings or other effects of the planned integration of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. Accordingly, such amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results if the acquisition had occurred on the dates
indicated or which may occur in the future.

Brands $ 302
Patents and technology 321
Customer relationships 3,067
Total amortizable intangibles 3,690
Brands with indefinite lives 4,895
Total intangible assets $ 8,585
The weighted average life of the $3,690 million of total amortizable intangibles is approximately 31 years from the date of acquisition.
The majority of the intangible asset valuation relates to brands. The assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life was based on a number of factors, including the competitive environment, market share, brand
history, product life cycles, operating plan and the macro-economic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. The brands that account for over 90% of the total value of all indefinite-life brands include LISTERINE ®, NICORETTE ®,
NEOSPORIN®, SUDAFED®, BENADRYL®, VISINE ® and BENYLIN®. The determinable-life brands include PURELL®, ACTIFED®, EFFERDENT® and other regional or country specific brands. The determinable-life brands have asset lives ranging from 5 to
40 years. The patents and technology intangibles are concentrated in the upper respiratory, oral care, medicated skin care, tobacco dependence and hair growth businesses and have asset lives ranging from 5 to 20 years. The estimated customer relationship
intangible asset useful lives, ranging from 30 to 40 years, reflect the very low historical and projected customer attrition rates among the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc.’s major retailer and distributor customers.
The IPR&D charge related to the acquisition of the Consumer Healthcare business of Pfizer Inc. was $320 million on a pre-tax basis and $217 million on an after-tax basis and is primarily associated with rights obtained to the switch of ZYRTEC® from U.S.
prescription to over-the-counter status. The switch was approved by the FDA effective November 2007. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using cash flow projections discounted for the risk inherent in such projects. A probability of success factor of 95%
was used to reflect inherent regulatory risk as of the acquisition date and the discount rate applied was 11%.
The Company completed the analysis of integration plans, pursuant to which the Company is incurring costs primarily related to the elimination of certain duplicate selling, general and administrative functions between the two companies in areas such as
global business services, corporate staff and go-to-market support, as well as excess manufacturing capacity.

18. Legal Proceedings
PRODUCT LIABILITY
The Company is involved in numerous product liability cases in the United States, many of which concern adverse reactions to drugs and medical devices. The damages claimed are substantial, and while the Company is confident of the adequacy of the
warnings and instructions for use that accompany such products, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. However, the Company believes that if any liability results from such cases, it will be substantially covered by existing amounts
accrued in the Company’s balance sheet and, where available, by third-party product liability insurance.
66 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2007 ANNUAL REPORTMultiple products of Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries are subject to numerous product liability claims and lawsuits, including ORTHO EVRA®, RISPERDAL®, DURAGESIC® and the CHARITÉ™ Artificial Disc. There are approximately 4,000 claimants who
have filed lawsuits or made claims regarding injuries allegedly due to ORTHO EVRA®, 613 claimants with respect to RISPERDAL®, 260 with respect to CHARITÉ™ and 49 with respect to DURAGESIC®. These claimants seek substantial compensatory and,
where available, punitive damages.
With respect to RISPERDAL®, the Attorneys General of five states and the Office of General Counsel of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have filed actions seeking reimbursement of Medicaid or other public funds for RISPERDAL® prescriptions written
for off-label use, compensation for treating their citizens for alleged adverse reactions to RISPERDAL®, civil fines or penalties, punitive damages, or other relief. The Attorney General of Texas has joined a qui tam action in that state seeking similar relief. Certain
of these actions also seek injunctive relief relating to the promotion of RISPERDAL®. The Attorneys General of a number of other states have indicated a potential interest in pursuing similar litigation against the company’s Janssen subsidiary, and have obtained
a tolling agreement staying the running of the statute of limitations while they inquire into the issues. In addition, there are six cases filed by union health plans seeking damages for alleged overpayments for RISPERDAL®, several of which seek certification as
class actions.
Numerous claims and lawsuits in the United States relating to the drug PROPULSID®, withdrawn from general sale by the Company’s Janssen subsidiary in 2000, have been resolved or are currently enrolled in settlement programs with an aggregate cap
below $100 million. Litigation concerning PROPULSID® is pending in Canada, where a class action of persons alleging adverse reactions to the drug has been certified.
AFFIRMATIVE STENT PATENT LITIGATION
In patent infringement actions tried in Delaware Federal District Court in late 2000, Cordis Corporation (Cordis), a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, obtained verdicts of infringement and patent validity, and damage awards against Boston Scientific Corporation
(Boston Scientific) and Medtronic AVE, Inc. (Medtronic) based on a number of Cordis vascular stent patents. In December 2000, the jury in the damage action against Boston Scientific returned a verdict of $324 million and the jury in the Medtronic action
returned a verdict of $271 million. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently upheld liability in these cases and returned the cases to the District Court for further proceedings, including on damages.
Cordis also has an arbitration claim against Medtronic accusing Medtronic of infringement by sale of stent products introduced by Medtronic subsequent to its products subject to the earlier action referenced above. Those subsequent products were found to
have been licensed to Medtronic pursuant to a 1997 license by an arbitration panel in March 2005. Further arbitration proceedings will determine whether royalties are owed for those products.
In January 2003, Cordis filed a patent infringement action against Boston Scientific in Delaware Federal District Court accusing its Express2™, Taxus® and Liberte® stents of infringing the Palmaz patent that expired in November 2005. The Liberte® stent
was also accused of infringing Cordis’ Gray patent that expires in 2016. In June 2005, a jury found that the Express2™, Taxus® and Liberte® stents infringed the Palmaz patent and that the Liberte® stent also infringed the Gray patent. Boston Scientific has
appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
PATENT LITIGATION AGAINST VARIOUS
JOHNSON & JOHNSON SUBSIDIARIES
The products of various Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries are the subject of various patent lawsuits, the outcomes of which could potentially adversely affect the ability of those subsidiaries to sell those products, or require the payment of past damages and
future royalties.
In July 2005, a jury in Federal District Court in Delaware found that the Cordis CYPHER® Stent infringed Boston Scientific’s Ding ’536 patent and that the Cordis CYPHER® and BX VELOCITY® Stents also infringed Boston Scientific’s Jang ’021 patent. The
jury also found both of those patents valid. Boston Scientific seeks substantial damages and an injunction in that action. The District Court denied motions by Cordis to overturn the jury verdicts or grant a new trial. Cordis has appealed to the Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit. The District Court indicated it will consider damages, willfulness and injunctive relief after the appeals have been decided.
Boston Scientific has brought actions in Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and France under its Kastenhofer patent, which purports to cover two-layer catheters such as those used to deliver the CYPHER® Stent, to enjoin the manufacture and sale of
allegedly infringing catheters in those countries, and to recover damages. A hearing in the Belgian case is scheduled for May 2008. A decision by the lower court in the Netherlands in Boston Scientific’s favor was reversed on appeal in April 2007. Boston
Scientific has filed an appeal to the Dutch Supreme Court. In October 2007, Boston Scientific prevailed in the nullity action challenging the validity of the Kastenhofer patent filed by Cordis in Germany. Cordis intends to appeal. No hearings have been scheduled
in the French action.
Trial in Boston Scientific’s U.S. case based on the Kastenhofer patent concluded in Federal Court in California in October 2007, with a jury verdict in favor of Cordis. The jury found the Kastenhofer patent invalid and found for Cordis with respect to
infringement of the patent asserted by Cordis in its counterclaim. Post trial motions and appeals are anticipated.
In Germany, Boston Scientific has several actions based on its Ding patents pending against the Cordis CYPHER® Stent. Cordis was successful in these actions at the trial level, but Boston Scientific has appealed.

LITIGATION AGAINST FILERS OF ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS (ANDA)
The following chart indicates lawsuits pending against generic firms that filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) seeking to market generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents
covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of these patents. In the event the subsidiary of the Company involved is not successful in these actions, or the statutory 30-month stay
expires before a ruling from the district court is obtained, the firms involved will have the ability, upon FDA approval, to introduce generic versions of the product at issue resulting in very substantial market share and revenue losses for the product of the
Company’s subsidiary.
As noted in the following chart, 30-month stays expired during 2006 and 2007, and will expire in 2008, 2009 and 2010 with respect to ANDA challenges regarding various products:

Trial in the action against Teva, Dr. Reddy’s and Mylan with respect to their ANDA challenges to the patent on ACIPHEX® of Eisai Inc., the Company’s subsidiary Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc.’s (Ortho-McNeil) marketing partner, proceeded before the
District Court in New York in March 2007. In May 2007, the Court held that the ACIPHEX® compound patent is enforceable. The Court had previously held that the patent is valid. Teva and Dr. Reddy’s have appealed both decisions to the Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit. Mylan withdrew its appeal.
In the action against Apotex regarding RISPERDAL® (risperidone) Oral Solution, the trial court dismissed Apotex’s challenge to the validity and infringement of two patents relating to formulations for an oral solution product. Apotex appealed this decision in
October 2007.
In the actions against Mylan with respect to the patent on TOPAMAX®, the District Court in New Jersey, in 2006, granted the motion of Ortho-McNeil for a preliminary injunction barring launch by Mylan of its generic versions of TOPAMAX®. In February 2007,
the District Court granted Ortho-McNeil’s motion for summary judgment dismissing Mylan’s claim that the patent was obvious, the only remaining issue in the case. The Court entered judgment in the case for Ortho-McNeil, and entered an injunction prohibiting
Mylan from marketing its generic topiramate products until a date no earlier than patent expiration in September 2008. Mylan has appealed this ruling. In April 2007, the District Court entered judgment against Cobalt pursuant to its stipulation to be bound by the
outcome in the Mylan suit. Cobalt appealed this ruling. The Court of Appeals heard argument on both appeals in November 2007. A ruling is expected in the near term.
In the action against Perrigo regarding a patent for PEPCID COMPLETE®, the District Court for the Southern District of New York, in June 2007, held that the patent was invalid as obvious. The Company’s subsidiary McNEIL-PPC, Inc. has appealed the
decision with its partners, Merck & Co., Inc., and Johnson & Johnson*Merck Consumer Pharmaceuticals Co.
In the action against Barr and AlphaPharm with respect to their ANDA challenges to the RAZADYNE® patent that Janssen licenses from Synaptech, Inc., a four-day non-jury trial was held in the District Court in Delaware in May 2007. The Court has yet to
issue its ruling in that action.
In the action against Andrx with respect to its ANDA challenge to the CONCERTA® patents, a five-day non-jury trial was held in the District Court in Delaware in December 2007. The Court has yet to issue its ruling in that action.
In the action against Sandoz with respect to its ANDA challenge to a RAZADYNE® ER patent that Janssen licenses from Synaptech, Inc., the action has been stayed pending the outcome in the above litigation in Delaware federal court. Sandoz has
challenged only one of two patents for RAZADYNE® ER, and has certified that it will await expiration of the second patent in 2019 before marketing its generic version of RAZADYNE® ER.
In the action against Teva with respect to its ANDA challenge to an AXERT® patent that Janssen licenses from Almirall Prodesfarma, S.A., the parties settled their dispute and the court entered a consent judgment in January 2008.
In the weeks following the adverse ruling in the DITROPAN XL® ANDA litigation against Mylan in September 2005, Johnson & Johnson and ALZA received seven antitrust class action complaints filed by purchasers of the product. They allege that Johnson &
Johnson and ALZA violated federal and state antitrust laws by knowingly pursuing baseless patent litigation, and thereby delaying entry into the market by Mylan and Impax. In late 2007, plaintiffs in all these cases dismissed their claims with prejudice.
AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICE (AWP) LITIGATION
Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries, along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, are defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain
pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Most of these cases, both federal actions and
state actions removed to federal court, have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) in Federal District Court in Boston, Massachusetts. The plaintiffs in these cases include classes of private persons or entities that paid for any
portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP.
The MDL Court identified classes of Massachusetts-only private insurers providing “Medi-gap” insurance coverage and private payers for physician-administered drugs where payments were based on AWP (“Class 2” and “Class 3”), and a national class of
individuals who made co-payments for physician-administered drugs covered by Medicare (“Class 1”). A trial of the two Massachusetts-only class actions concluded before the MDL Court in December 2006. In June 2007, the MDL Court issued post-trial rulings,
dismissing the Johnson & Johnson defendants from the case regarding all claims of Classes 2 and 3, and subsequently of Class 1 as well. Trial in the action brought by
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 69the Attorney General of the State of Alabama making allegations related to AWP is expected to proceed during 2008. Additional AWP cases brought by various Attorneys General are expected to be set for trial in 2008.

In March 2005, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy), a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary, received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office, District of New Jersey, seeking records concerning contractual relationships between DePuy and surgeons or
surgeons-in-training involved in hip and knee replacement and reconstructive surgery. This investigation was resolved by DePuy and the four other leading suppliers of hip and knee implants in late September 2007 by agreements with the U.S. Attorney’s Office
for the District of New Jersey. The settlements include an 18-month Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA), acceptance by each company of a monitor to assure compliance with the DPA and, with respect to four of the five companies, payment of settlement
monies and entry into five year Corporate Integrity Agreements. DePuy paid $85 million as its settlement. In November 2007, the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts issued a civil investigative demand to DePuy seeking information
regarding financial relationships between a number of Massachusetts-based orthopedic surgeons and providers and DePuy, which relationships had been publicly disclosed by DePuy pursuant to the DPA. In February 2008, DePuy received a written request for

In February 2007, Johnson & Johnson voluntarily disclosed to the DOJ and the SEC that subsidiaries outside the United States are believed to have made improper payments in connection with the sale of medical devices in two small-market countries,
which payments may fall within the jurisdiction of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). In the course of continuing dialogues with the agencies, other issues potentially rising to the level of FCPA violations in additional markets have been brought to the
attention of the agencies by the Company. The Company has provided and will continue to provide additional information to DOJ and SEC, and will cooperate with the agencies’ reviews of these matters.
In March 2007, Cordis received a letter request for documents from the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives regarding marketing and safety of drug-eluting stents. Cordis is cooperating in responding to the
request.
In March 2007, the Company received separate subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Philadelphia, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Boston and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in San Francisco. The subpoenas relate to investigations by these three offices
referenced above concerning, respectively, sales and marketing of RISPERDAL® by Janssen, TOPAMAX® by Ortho-McNeil and NATRECOR® by Scios. The subpoenas request information regarding the Company’s corporate supervision and oversight of these
three subsidiaries, including their sales and marketing of these drugs. The Company is cooperating in responding to these requests. In addition, the U.S. Attorney’s office in Boston has issued subpoenas to several employees of Johnson & Johnson.
In March 2007, the Company received a letter from the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the U.S. House of Representatives seeking answers to several questions regarding marketing and safety of PROCRIT®, the erythropoietin product sold by
Ortho-Biotech. In May 2007, Senator Grassley, the ranking member of the United States Senate Committee on Finance, sent the Company a letter seeking information relating to PROCRIT®. The Company provided its initial response in July 2007. In May 2007,
the New York State Attorney General issued a subpoena seeking information relating to PROCRIT®. Like the House and Senate requests, the subpoena asks for materials relating to PROCRIT® safety, marketing and pricing. The Company is responding to
these requests.
In April 2007, the Company received two subpoenas from the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Delaware. The subpoenas seek documents and information relating to nominal pricing agreements. For purposes of the subpoenas, nominal pricing
agreements are defined as agreements under which the Company agreed to provide a pharmaceutical product for less than ten percent of the Average Manufacturer Price for the product. The Company is responding to the subpoenas and will cooperate with
the inquiry.
In August 2007, the Company received a request for documents and interviews of witnesses from the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the U.S. House of Representatives concerning GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) issues involving the
CYPHER® Stent. The letter states that FDA inspectors in 2003 identified “numerous systemic violations” of GMP’s in connection with CYPHER® manufacturing but nonetheless allowed Cordis to continue marketing CYPHER® Stents. Cordis is cooperating in
responding to this request.
In October 2007, the Company received a request for documents from Senator Grassley on behalf of the Committee on Finance of the U.S. Senate concerning continuing medical education payments to specific physicians. The Company is in the process of
complying with the request.
In December 2007, the Company and its subsidiary Janssen received a request from Senator Grassley on behalf of the Committee on Finance of the U.S. Senate for documents and information concerning the marketing and promotion of RISPERDAL® for
use by nursing home patients. The companies are in the process of collecting responsive documents and obtaining the relevant information.
With respect to all the above matters, the Company and its subsidiaries are vigorously contesting the allegations asserted against them and otherwise pursuing defenses to maximize the prospect of success. The Company and its subsidiaries involved in
these matters continually evaluate their strategies in managing these matters and, where appropriate, pursue settlements
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 71and other resolutions where those are in the best interest of the Company.
The Company is also involved in a number of other patent, trademark and other lawsuits incidental to its business. The ultimate legal and financial liability of the Company in respect to all claims, lawsuits and proceedings referred to above cannot be
estimated with any certainty. However, in the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance
sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows
for that period.
19. Earnings Per Share
The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2007, December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006:
(Shares in Millions Except Per Share Data) 2007 2006 2005
Basic net earnings per share $ 3.67 3.76 3.38
Average shares outstanding — basic 2,882.9 2,936.4 2,973.9
Potential shares exercisable under stock option plans 178.6 207.0 203.1
Less: shares repurchased under treasury stock method (154.5) (186.3) (178.6)
Convertible debt shares 3.7 3.9 4.4
Adjusted average shares outstanding — diluted 2,910.7 2,961.0 3,002.8
Diluted net earnings per share $ 3.63 3.73 3.35
The diluted net earnings per share calculation includes the dilutive effect of convertible debt: a decrease in interest expense of $4 million, $4 million and $11 million after tax for years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Diluted net earnings per share excludes 64 million, 43 million and 45 million shares underlying stock options for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, as the exercise price of these options was greater than their average market value, which would result in an
anti-dilutive effect on diluted earnings per share.

22. Restructuring
In the third quarter of 2007, the Company announced restructuring initiatives in an effort to improve its overall cost structure. This action was taken to offset the anticipated negative impacts associated with generic competition in the Pharmaceutical segment and
challenges in the drug-eluting stent market. The Company’s Pharmaceuticals segment will reduce its cost base by consolidating certain operations, while continuing to invest in recently launched products and its late-stage pipeline of new products. The Cordis
franchise is moving to a more integrated business model to address the market changes underway with drug-eluting stents and to better serve the broad spectrum of its patients’ cardiovascular needs, while reducing its cost base. This program will allow the
Company to accelerate steps to standardize and streamline certain aspects of its enterprise-wide functions such as human resources, finance and information technology to support growth across the business, while also leveraging its scale more effectively in
areas such as procurement to benefit its operating companies. Additionally, as part of this program the Company plans to eliminate approximately 4,400 positions of which approximately 1,400 were eliminated in 2007.
During the fiscal third quarter of 2007, the Company recorded $745 million in related pre-tax charges of which, approximately $500 million of the pre-tax restructuring charges are expected to require cash payments. The $745 million of restructuring charges
consists of severance costs of $450 million, asset write-offs of $272 million and $23 million related to leasehold obligations. The $272 million of asset write-offs relate to property, plant and equipment of $166 million, intangible assets of $48 million and other
assets of $58 million.
The following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending for the fiscal year ended 2007:
(Dollars in Millions) Severance
2007 severance charge $ 450
Cash outlays* (46)
Reserve balance, December 30, 2007 $ 404
* Cash outlays for severance are expected to be paid out over the next 12 to 18 months in accordance with the Company’s plans and local laws.
For additional information on the restructuring as it relates to the segments see Note 11.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 73Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the
Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2007. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework.” These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Company’s
assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.
Based on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December 30, 2007, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2007 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

74 JOHNSON & JOHNSON 2007 ANNUAL REPORTReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Johnson & Johnson:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of earnings, statements of equity, and statements of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Johnson & Johnson and its
subsidiaries (“the Company”) at December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying, “Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

EX-99 11 y47910exv99.htm EX-99: CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
EXHIBIT 99
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM
ACT OF 1995 — “SAFE HARBOR” FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The Company may from time to time make certain forward-looking statements in publicly-released materials, both written and oral. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and anticipate results based
on management’s plans that are subject to uncertainty. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among
other things, discussions of future operations, financial performance, the Company’s strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approvals, market position and expenditures.
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future events. The Company cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be accurate, although the Company believes that it has been reasonable in its
expectations and assumptions. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the Company’s expectations and projections. Investors are
therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Furthermore, the Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.
Some important factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ from the Company’s expectations in any forward-looking statements are as follows:
Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins;
Competitive factors, including technological advances achieved and patents attained by competitors as well as new products introduced by competitors;
Challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors or allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties, which could potentially affect the Company’s competitive position and ability to sell the products
in question and require the payment of past damages and future royalties. In particular, generic drug firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking to market generic forms of most of the Company’s key pharmaceutical
products, prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event that the Company is not successful in defending the resulting lawsuits, generic versions of the product at issue will be introduced, resulting in very
substantial market share and revenue losses;
Financial distress and bankruptcies experienced by significant customers and suppliers that could impair their ability, as the case may be, to purchase the Company’s products, pay for products previously purchased or meet their
obligations to the Company under supply arrangements;
The impact on political and economic conditions due to terrorist attacks in the U.S. and other parts of the world or U.S. military action overseas, as well as instability in the financial markets which could result from such terrorism
or military actions;
Interruptions of computer and communication systems, including computer viruses, that could impair the Company’s ability to conduct business and communicate internally and with its customers;
Health care changes in the U.S. and other countries resulting in pricing pressures, including the continued consolidation among health care providers, trends toward managed care and health care cost containment, the shift towards
governments becoming the primary payers of health care expenses and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion, reimbursement and pricing generally;
Government laws and regulations, affecting U.S. and foreign operations, including those relating to securities laws compliance, trade, monetary and fiscal policies, taxes, price controls, regulatory approval of new products,
licensing and patent rights, and possible drug reimportation legislation;
Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant and results from time to time in product and process obsolescence.The development of new and improved products is important to the Company’s success in all areas of its business;
Challenges and difficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals in the United States and abroad,
gain and maintain market approval of products and the possibility of encountering infringement claims by competitors with respect to patent or other intellectual property rights which can preclude or delay commercialization of a product;
Significant litigation adverse to the Company including product liability claims, patent infringement claims and antitrust claims;
The health care industry has come under increased scrutiny by government agencies and state attorneys general and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including
debarment from government business;
Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the FDA (or foreign counterparts) or declining sales;
The impact of business combinations, including acquisitions and divestitures, both internally for the Company and externally in the pharmaceutical, medical device and health care industries; and
Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board.
The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact upon the Company’s ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or
identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company has identified the factors on this list as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
Johnson & Johnson, employing approximately 101,800 people worldwide, is
engaged in the manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health
care field. With over 190 operating companies, it conducts business in virtually
all countries of the world. Johnson & Johnson's primary interest, both
historically and currently, has been in products related to human health and
well-being. Johnson & Johnson was organized in the State of New Jersey in 1887.
Johnson & Johnson is organized on the principle of decentralized
management. The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal
management group responsible for the allocation of the resources of the Company.
This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of U.S. and international
companies related to each of the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices &
Diagnostics businesses. Each international subsidiary is, with some exceptions,
managed by citizens of the country where it is located.
SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS; GEOGRAPHIC AREAS
Johnson & Johnson's worldwide business is divided into three segments:
Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices & Diagnostics. Additional
information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the
narrative and tabular (but not the graphic) descriptions of segments and
geographic areas captioned "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
Operations and Financial Condition -- Segments of Business, Consumer,
Pharmaceutical, Medical Devices & Diagnostics and Geographic Areas" on pages 27
through 29 and 49 of Johnson & Johnson's Annual Report to Shareowners for fiscal
year 2001.

PHARMACEUTICAL
The Pharmaceutical segment's principal worldwide franchises are in the
antifungal, anti-infective, cardiovascular, dermatology, gastrointestinal,
hematology, immunology, neurology, oncology, pain management, psychotropic,urology and women's health fields. These products are distributed both directly
and through wholesalers for use by health care professionals and the general
public. Prescription drugs in the antifungal field include NIZORAL
(ketoconazole), SPORANOX (itraconazole), TERAZOL (terconazole) and DAKTARIN
(miconazole nitrate) antifungal products. Prescription drugs in the
anti-infective field include FLOXIN (ofloxacin) and LEVAQUIN (levofloxacin).
Prescription drugs in the cardiovascular field include RETAVASE (reteplase), a
recombinant biologic cardiology care product for the treatment of acute
myocardial infarction to improve blood flow to the heart, and REOPRO (abciximab)
for the treatment of
<PAGE>
acute cardiac disease. Prescription drugs in the dermatology field include
RETIN-A MICRO (tretinoin), a dermatological cream for acne. Prescription drugs
in the gastrointestinal field include ACIPHEX (rabeprazole sodium, sold outside
the U.S. as PARIET), a proton pump inhibitor for treating erosive
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), symptomatic GERD and duodenal ulcers;
IMODIUM (loperamide HCl), an antidiarrheal; MOTILIUM (domperidone), a
gastrointestinal mobilizer; and REMICADE (infliximab), a novel monoclonal
antibody for treatment of certain Crohn's disease patients. REMICADE is also
indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Prescription drugs in the hematology field include PROCRIT (epoetin alfa,
sold outside the U.S. as EPREX), a biotechnology derived version of the human
hormone erythropoietin that stimulates red blood cell production, which
accounted for 10.4% of the Company's total revenues in 2001. Prescription drugs
in the immunology field include ORTHOCLONE OKT-3 (muromonab-CD3), for reversing
the rejection of kidney, heart and liver transplants. Prescription drugs in the

pain; ULTRACET (tramadol hydrochloride/acetaminophen) for the short-term
management of acute pain; and ULTRAM (tramadol hydrochloride), an analgesic for

estradiol) and TRICILEST (norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol, sold in the U.S. as
ORTHO TRI-CYCLEN) group of oral contraceptives and ORTHO-PREFEST (17 (beta)-
estradiol/norgestimate) for hormone replacement therapy. In 2001, sales to three
distributors, McKesson HBOC, Cardinal Distribution and AmerisourceBergen Corp.
accounted for 10.4%, 10.3% and 10.2%, respectively, of total revenues. These
sales were concentrated in the Pharmaceutical segment.
MEDICAL DEVICES & DIAGNOSTICS
The Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of
products used by or under the direction of health care professionals, including,
suture and mechanical wound closure products, surgical equipment and devices,
wound management and infection prevention products, interventional and
diagnostic cardiology products, diagnostic equipment and supplies, joint
replacements and disposable contact lenses. These products are used principally
in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals,
diagnostic laboratories and clinics. Distribution to these markets is done both
directly and through surgical supply and other dealers.
INTERNATIONAL
The international business of Johnson & Johnson is conducted by
subsidiaries located in 54 countries outside the United States, which are
selling products in more than 175 countries throughout the world. The products
made and sold in the international business include many of those described
above under "Business -- Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices &
Diagnostics." However, the principal markets, products and methods of
distribution in the international business vary with the country and the
culture. The products sold in the international business include not only those
which were developed in the United States but also those which were developed by
subsidiaries abroad.
Investments and activities in some countries outside the United States are
subject to higher risks than comparable domestic activities because the
investment and commercial climate is influenced by restrictive economic policies
and political uncertainties.
RAW MATERIALSRaw materials essential to Johnson & Johnson's business are generally
readily available from multiple sources.
2
<PAGE>
PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS
Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of obtaining patent protection on its
products and processes where possible. Johnson & Johnson owns or is licensed
under a number of patents relating to its products and manufacturing processes,
which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the
operation of its business. However, it is believed that except for the patents
related to PROCRIT/EXPREX, no single patent or related group of patents is
material in relation to Johnson & Johnson as a whole.
Johnson & Johnson has made a practice of selling its products under
trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available
means. Johnson & Johnson's trademarks are protected by registration in the
United States and other countries where its products are marketed. Johnson &
Johnson considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance
in the operation of its business.
SEASONALITY
Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality;
however spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in
other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for
advertising and research grants.
COMPETITION
In all its product lines, Johnson & Johnson companies compete with
companies both large and small, located in the United States and abroad.
Competition is strong in all lines without regard to the number and size of the
competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development
of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and
processes, is particularly significant and results from time to time in product
and process obsolescence. The development of new and improved products is
important to Johnson & Johnson's success in all areas of its business. This
competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research
and in multiple sales forces. In addition, the winning and retention of customer
acceptance of Johnson & Johnson's consumer products involve heavy expenditures
for advertising, promotion and selling.
RESEARCH
Research activities are important to all segments of Johnson & Johnson's
business. Major research facilities are located not only in the United States
but also in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Switzerland and the
United Kingdom. The costs of Johnson & Johnson's worldwide research activities
relating to the development of new products, the improvement of existing
products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental
regulations for the protection of the consumer amounted to $3,591, $3,105, and
$2,768 million for fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. These costs
are charged directly to income in the year in which incurred. All research was
sponsored by Johnson & Johnson.
ENVIRONMENT
During the past year Johnson & Johnson was subject to a variety of federal,
state and local environmental protection measures. Johnson & Johnson believes
that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable
environmental laws and regulations. Johnson & Johnson's compliance with these
requirements did not and is not expected to have a material effect upon its
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
REGULATION
Most of Johnson & Johnson's business is subject to varying degrees of
governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and
the general trend is toward regulation of increasing stringency. In the United
States, the drug, device, diagnostics and cosmetic industries have long been
subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies, primarily as
to product safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling. The exercise of broad
regulatory powers by the Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA")
3
<PAGE>
continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentationrequired for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase
in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends toward product and
process regulation are also evident in a number of major countries outside of
the United States, especially in the European Economic Community where efforts
are continuing to harmonize the internal regulatory systems.
The costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of
study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative
bodies in the United States and other countries. In the United States, attention
has been focused on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors
to write prescriptions for particular drugs or recommend particular medical
devices. Even in the absence of new government regulation, managed care has
become a more potent force in the market place and it is likely that increased
attention will be paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and
medical device utilization and the quality of health care.
The regulatory agencies under whose purview Johnson & Johnson operates have
administrative powers that may subject Johnson & Johnson to such actions as
product recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In
some cases Johnson & Johnson may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls
voluntarily.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Johnson & Johnson and its worldwide subsidiaries operate 148 manufacturing
facilities occupying approximately 17 million square feet of floor space.
The manufacturing facilities are used by the industry segments of Johnson &
Johnson's business approximately as follows:

In addition to the manufacturing facilities discussed above, Johnson &
Johnson maintains numerous office and warehouse facilities throughout the world.
Research facilities are also discussed in Item 1 under "Business -- Research."
Johnson & Johnson generally seeks to own its manufacturing facilities,
although some, principally in locations abroad, are leased. Office and warehouse
facilities are often leased.

<PAGE>
Johnson & Johnson's properties are maintained in good operating conditionand repair and are well utilized.
For information regarding lease obligations see Note 4 "Rental Expense and
Lease Commitments" under "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 37
of Johnson & Johnson's Annual Report to Shareowners for fiscal year 2001.
Segment information on additions to Johnson & Johnson's property, plant and
equipment is contained on page 49 of Johnson & Johnson's Annual Report to
Shareowners for fiscal year 2001.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The information set forth in Note 18 "Legal Proceedings" under "Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements" on page 46 of Johnson & Johnson's Annual
Report to Shareowners for fiscal year 2001 is incorporated herein by reference.
The Company or its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings
brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state laws, in which
the primary relief sought is the cost of past and future remediation. While it
is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in the
opinion of the Company, such proceedings would not have a material adverse
effect on the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the
Company.
ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

<PAGE>
Exhibit 10(g)
JOHNSON & JOHNSON
CERTIFICATE OF EXTRA COMPENSATION PLANWITNESSETH - WHEREAS, Johnson & Johnson (the "Company") wishes to
reward its employees, as well as employees of its subsidiaries (an "Employee")
for faithful service in the past and more particularly to encourage Employees in
their future work by permitting Employees to share in the growth and success of
the Company's enterprises by issuing to them Shares of Certificates of Extra
Compensation (the "CEC Shares"), and to that end to receive as extra
compensation sums based upon and measured by (a) the amount of cash dividends
from time to time declared upon an equal number of shares of common stock of the
Company (the "Common Stock") and (b) the formula value of such CEC Shares as
established pursuant to Article "NINTH" of this Plan (the "Formula Value") at
the time of termination of employment or death while in such employment:
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the promises
herein contained, and so long as the Employee shall remain an Employee, it is
agreed that:
FIRST: The number of CEC Shares designated upon which the Employee's extra
compensation shall be based is the aggregate number of CEC Shares awarded to
such Employee in accordance with the Plan as evidenced by the written records of
Company.
SECOND: While the Employee remains an Employee, the Company shall pay to the
Employee on the same date on which is paid any cash dividend on the Company's
Common Stock, a sum equivalent to such cash dividend multiplied by the total
number of CEC Shares designated for such Employee.
THIRD: In the event of the Employee's death while an Employee, the Company shall
pay to the Employee's beneficiary (as last recorded over the Employee's
signature on the records of the Company) a sum of money which shall be
determined as a percentage of the Formula Value of such CEC Shares. This
percentage shall be based upon the period elapsing between the date a CEC Share
has been awarded and death, as follows:
- In the event of death within eighteen (18) months of the date
of an award: 30%
- In the event of death after eighteen (18) months but within
forty-two (42) months of the date of an award: 70%
- In the event of death after forty-two (42) months of the date
of an award: 100%
In the event of the termination of the Employee's employment because of
retirement, physical or mental disability, or otherwise (except by reason of
death), the Company shall pay to the Employee a sum of money which shall be
determined as a percentage of the Formula Value of such CEC Shares. For the
purposes of this Plan, an Employee placed on
<PAGE>
long-term disability is not considered to be an Employee. This percentage shall
be based upon the period elapsing between the date a CEC Share has been awarded
and such termination of employment, as follows:
- In the event of such termination within twelve (12) months of
the date of an award: 0%
- In the event of such termination after twelve (12) months but
within twenty-four (24) months of the date of an award: 20%
- In the event of such termination after twenty-four (24) months
but within thirty-six (36) months of the date of an award: 40%
- In the event of such termination after thirty-six (36) months
but within forty-eight (48) months of the date of an award:
60%
- In the event of such termination after forty-eight (48) months
but within sixty (60) months of the date of an award: 80%
- In the event of such termination after sixty (60) months from
the date of an award: 100%
The Company shall pay any such sum of money due under this Article
"THIRD", in a single lump sum, unless Employee has duly elected, pursuant to the
provisions of Article "SEVENTH" to defer receipt of such sum upon his/her
retirement.
FOURTH: At the election of each Employee, to be made as provided for below, the
payment of any sum due to an Employee upon his/her retirement may be deferred
and paid in either a single lump sum or in installments. A lump sum payment may
be deferred for up to ten taxable years following the Employee's retirementdate. if installment payments are elected, the first installment payment may be
made immediately upon retirement or be deferred for up to ten taxable years.
Installment payments will be made annually (in the manner described below) and
in approximately equal installment amounts (i.e., the value of the CEC payout
balance, plus accrued interest, divided by the number of remaining
installments). The minimum number of annual installments is two (2) and the
maximum number is fifteen (15). An Employee may elect to defer up to 100% of the
value of his/her total CEC holdings at retirement; or, any percentage increment
less than that. The following rules shall apply with respect to all payments:
a) Immediate Lump Sum Payment - The Employee will receive the full
value of his/her CEC holdings in the calendar month of his/her
retirement effective date. Employees retiring prior to the
determination of the prior years CEC value will receive 97% of the
estimated value with the remainder paid shortly after the final value
is determined.
b) Deferred Lump Sum Payment - The Employee will receive the full
value of his/her CEC holdings, plus any accrued interest, on or about
January 15 of the year he/she elects to receive payment in.
c) Immediate Commencement of Installments - The Employee will receive
the first installment in the calendar month of his/her retirement
<PAGE>
effective date. All subsequent installments, plus any accrued
interest, will be paid on or about January 15 of each year.
d) Deferred Commencement of Installments - The Employee will receive
the first and all subsequent installments, plus any accrued interest,
on or about January 15 of each year.
FIFTH: With respect to any payments which are deferred and/or paid in
installments, interest shall be paid by the Company from the effective date of
retirement to the date of any such payment. The interest rate for all deferred
and/or installment payments to an Employee shall be fixed at the date of
retirement and shall be the rate (rounded to 1 decimal place) offered, as
reported in the Wall Street Journal on the effective retirement date, on a
United States Treasury Instrument for the period comparable to the length of the
period of the deferral and/or installment payments. The interest shall be
compounded semi-annually on, the last calendar day of June and December of each
year. If more than one instrument is quoted, the average of such rates shall be
utilized. By way of example, if an election is made to receive installments over
eight (8) years, the comparable eight (8) year U.S. Treasury Rate shall be
utilized; if an election is made to defer the commencement of installments for
two (2) years with installments paid out over ten (10) years, the comparable
twelve (12) year U.S. Treasury Rate shall be utilized. Once established, the
interest rate shall remain fixed for the period of the deferral.
SIXTH: In the event of death of an Employee (whether or not prior to the
termination of his/her employment) the Company will make payment in full of the
balance, plus any accrued interest, as soon as administratively practical in a
single lump sum payment to the designated beneficiary.
In the event no deferral or installment election is made, the total
amount of the CEC holdings will be paid in accordance with the provisions of
paragraph (a) of Article "FOURTH" in a lump sum payment as soon as practical
following an Employee's retirement effective date.
SEVENTH: An election by an Employee to defer payment or elect installments of
all or a part of his/her CEC holdings beyond his/her effective retirement date
must be made a minimum of twelve (12) months prior to the date of such
retirement date. Any such election may be revised or revoked up to twelve (12)
months prior to such retirement date. For the twelve month period prior to such
retirement date, any election is irrevocable and thus may not be revoked or
otherwise revised.
The Company may disallow an Employee's desire to defer payments
and/or elect installments if it determines that such participation would
jeopardize the Plan's compliance with applicable law or the Plan's status as a
"top hat plan" under ERISA.
Notwithstanding the above, an exception has been made for Employees
who have a retirement effective date between January 1, 1997
<PAGE>
and June 30, 1997. For such Employees, the deferral and/or installment election
must be made a minimum of three (3) months and in the calendar year prior to the
retirement date. For example, an Employee who retires on January 1, 1997, must
make the deferral and/or installment election no later than September 30, 1996;
if the retirement date is May 1, 1997, such election must, be made not later
than December 31, 1996. With respect to any retirement occurring between July 1,
1997, and December 1, 1997, an election must be made prior to December 31, 1996.Any such election to defer and/or receive installment payments may only be
revised or revoked prior to the last permissible date for making such election.
After such time the election may not be revoked or otherwise revised.
An election to defer payment and/or be paid in installments is
effective only when filed with the administrator referred to in Article
"FIFTEENTH" on the form utilized for such purpose. Any election made after the
required deadline shall be disregarded.
AN ELECTION TO DEFER AND/OR BE PAID IN INSTALLMENTS SHOULD ONLY BE
MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH AN EMPLOYEE'S TAX AND/OR FINANCIAL ADVISOR.
EIGHTH: The number of CEC Shares designated and upon which is based and by which
is measured the extra compensation of the Employee shall be increased
proportionately from time to time to the extent that a stock split or a dividend
in Common Stock is declared and paid upon the issued and outstanding Common
Stock of the Company. Likewise, the number of CEC Shares shall be reduced
proportionately from time to time to the extent that the number of CEC Shares of
issued and outstanding Common Stock of the Company is reduced by reorganization,
reduction of capital, or otherwise.
NINTH: For the purposes of Article "THIRD" of this agreement, the Formula Value
of the CEC Shares shall be determined by the Company's Board of Directors which
shall, except in the event mentioned below, determine such Formula Value as the
sum of one-half of the asset value per share of Common Stock plus one-half of
the earning-power value per share of Common Stock calculated as follows:
The sum of one-half of the consolidated net asset value per share of
Common Stock (being assets per share, less liabilities (including
reserves, other than surplus reserve) per share, as such assets and
liabilities appear on the books of the Company and its subsidiaries
as of the fiscal year end immediately preceding the date of
valuation) plus one-half of the consolidated earning-power value per
share of Common Stock (determined as the average of annual net
earnings per share of Common Stock after all taxes as such net
earnings appear on the books of the Company and its subsidiaries for
five (5) fiscal years preceding the date of valuation, capitalized as
a return on capital invested at eight percent (8%), i.e., a multiple
of twelve and one-half (121 1/2) times such average earnings per
share).
For the purpose of the foregoing calculation, the books of the
Company and its subsidiaries shall be conclusive. The method of consolidation
shall be that adopted by the Company in preparing the
<PAGE>
last previous annual report to its stockholders, including appropriate provision
for taxes both foreign and domestic which might be incurred in remitting income
of the subsidiaries to the Company. The decisions of the Company's Treasurer at
all times, and from time to time, as to procedures to be adopted in maintaining
the books of the Company and its subsidiaries, preparation of balance sheets and
income statements, method of and adjustments made in consolidation, and all
matters of accounting practice and procedures shall be conclusive.
In the event that it shall be the opinion of the Board of Directors
of the Company that the calculation made as provided above does not result in a
true value, as of any date at which under Article "THIRD" such determination is
necessary, the Board may but shall not be obligated to vary the formula to the
extent of modifying the multiple by which the average earnings per share shall
be multiplied.
The Board of Directors shall, on or before May fifteenth of each
year, determine and announce the Formula Value of the Company's common stock as
of the immediately preceding fiscal year end for the purposes of this Plan.
TENTH: Dividends and share values are used herein only as measures of the extra
compensation to be paid hereunder. Nothing herein contained shall be construed
as an agreement to transfer to the Employee, or to his/her beneficiary, nor
shall either acquire, by virtue of his/her being awarded CEC Shares, any right,
title, or interest whatsoever in or to, any of the Company's Common Stock.
ELEVENTH: No right of benefit to CEC Shares awarded under the Plan is
assignable. The Company does not fund the obligations created by the Employee
participation in the CEC Plan. Rather, the Company makes an unsecured promise to
pay these obligations out of general corporate assets. This applies to
obligations for both active and retired participants. Commencing with awards
made at year end 1996, certificates representing CEC shares will no longer be
issued. Instead the number of CEC shares awarded shall be recorded on the books
of the Company.
TWELFTH: Regular part-time employees (those working 20 hours or more a week)
shall be considered Employees under this Plan. Any change to part-time status ofless than 20 hours a week shall be considered a termination, provided, however,
that in the event such employee is over the age of 55, such employee shall, for
purposes of this Plan only, be deemed to have retired. Nothing contained in the
Plan shall be construed to alter the present employment for an indefinite term,
which is terminable by either Employee or Company without prior advance notice
to the other.
THIRTEENTH: An employee who leaves the Company or one of its subsidiaries, at
the request of the Company, to work at a joint venture operation in which the
Company (or one of its subsidiaries) has a minority partnership interest, may,
in the sole discretion of the Management Compensation Committee, be considered
an "Employee" solely for the purposes of this Plan for a period of up to three
years
<PAGE>
following his or her departure from the Company. This arrangement may be
extended for up to two additional years, if the Management Compensation
Committee, in its sole discretion, determines that it is in the best interest of
the Company to do so. If any such person ceases employment with such a joint
venture operation, without a concomitant return to employment with the Company
(or one of its subsidiaries), then such person shall immediately be considered
to be terminated, and cease to be considered an Employee, for the purposes of
this Plan.
FOURTEENTH: An Employee may designate one or more beneficiaries to receive the
value of his/her payout upon death. Should a beneficiary predecease the
Employee, or should a beneficiary not be named, the amount designated for such

(1) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges represents the historical ratio of
Johnson & Johnson and is calculated on a total enterprise basis. The ratio
is computed by dividing the sum of earnings before provision for taxes and
fixed charges (excluding capitalized interest) by fixed charges. Fixed
charges represent interest (including capitalized interest) and amortization
of debt discount and expense and the interest factor of all rentals,
consisting of an appropriate interest factor on operating leases.
(2) Earnings for the year ended January 3, 1999 include charges related to
restructuring of $613 million and in-process research and development
charges of $298 million. Excluding the effect of these charges, the ratio of
earnings to fixed charges would have been 16.12.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results
of Operations and Financial Condition
OVERVIEW
Record 2001 sales of $33.0 billion exceeded 2000 sales by $3.2 billion or 10.6%
and marked the 69th year of consecutive positive sales growth. This growth was
led by the strong performances of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices &
Diagnostics segments. During 2001, the Company completed its merger with ALZA
Corporation, a research-based pharmaceutical company with innovative drug
delivery technologies and completed the acquisition of Inverness Medical
Technology, a supplier of LifeScan's electromechanical products. These
investments are part of the Company's continuing commitment to build a strong
science and technology-based business.
The balance sheet remains strong with cash generated from worldwide
operations at a record $8.9 billion in 2001. Cash dividends per share paid to
shareowners in 2001 increased by 12.9% over 2000 and represented the 39th
consecutive year of cash dividend increases. The Company continues to be one of
a few companies with a Triple A credit rating.
The Company's objective is to achieve superior levels of capital
efficient profitable growth. To accomplish this, the Company's management
operates the business consistent with certain strategic principles that have
proven successful over time. To this end, the Company participates in growth
areas in human health care and is committed to attaining leadership positions in
these growth segments through the development of innovative products and
services. In 2001, $3.6 billion or 10.9% of sales was invested in research and
development, recognizing the importance of on-going development of new and
differentiated products and services.
The Company's system of management operates on a decentralized basis.
With more than 190 operating companies located in 54 countries, the Company
views this management philosophy as an asset and fundamental to the success of a
broadly based business. It also fosters an entrepreneurial spirit, combining the
extensive resources of a large organization with the ability to react quickly to
local market changes and challenges. Businesses are managed for the long term in
order to sustain leadership positions and achieve growth that provides an
enduring source of value to shareowners.
Unifying the management team and the Company's dedicated employees in
achieving these objectives is the Johnson & Johnson Credo. The Credo provides a
common set of values and serves as a constant reminder of the Company's
responsibilities to its customers, employees, communities and shareowners. TheCompany believes that these basic principles, along with its overall mission of
improving the quality of life for people everywhere, will enable Johnson &
Johnson to continue to be among the leaders in the health care industry.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
The Company and its subsidiaries have 101,800 employees worldwide and are
engaged in the manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health
care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the
world. The Company's primary interest, both historically and currently, has been
in products related to human health and well-being.
The Company is organized on the principle of decentralized management.
The Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group
responsible for the operations and allocation of the resources of the Company.
This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of domestic and
international companies which span the Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical
Devices & Diagnostics businesses. Each international subsidiary is, with some
exceptions, managed by citizens of the country where it is located.
In all its product lines, the Company competes with companies both
large and small, located in the United States of America and abroad. Competition
is strong in all lines without regard to the number and size of the competing
companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the
improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly
significant and results from time to time in product and process obsolescence.
The development of new and improved products is important to the Company's
success in all areas of its business. This competitive environment requires
substantial investments in continuing research and in multiple sales forces. In
addition, the winning and retention of customer acceptance of the Company's
consumer products involves heavy expenditures for advertising, promotion and
selling.

The Company believes that its operations comply in all material
respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company or its
subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings brought under the
Comprehensive
26
<PAGE>
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund, and comparable state laws, in which primary relief sought is the
cost of past and future remediation. While it is not feasible to predict or
determine the outcome of these proceedings, in the opinion of the Company, such
proceedings would not have a material adverse effect on the results of
operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.
Worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality;
however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in
other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for
advertising and research grants.
The worldwide effective income tax rate was 28.2% in 2001, 27.9% in
2000 and 27.3% in 1999. Refer to Note 8 for additional information.

December 2001. These include LEVAQUIN for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia,
an orally disintegrating formulation of RISPERDAL and a synthetic oral solution
of REMINYL for Alzheimer's disease.
Pharmaceutical segment sales in 2000 were $12.7 billion, an increase of
12.7% over 1999 including 21.4% growth in domestic sales. Operationally,
international sales increased 7.6% but were more than offset by a negative
currency impact of 8.9%. Worldwide sales gains in local currency of 16.1% were
partially offset by a negative currency impact of 3.4%. Sales growth reflects
the strong performance of PROCRIT/EPREX, RISPERDAL, DURAGESIC, LEVAQUIN,
REMICADE, ULTRAM, TOPAMAX, ACIPHEX/PARIET and the oral contraceptive line of
products. Sales growth was partially offset by restricted access to or limited
indications for PROPULSID/PREPULSID in a number of markets around the world.
Pharmaceutical segment sales in 1999 were $11.2 billion, an increase of
20.7% over 1998, including 28.9% growth in domestic sales. International sales
increased 9.4% as sales gains in local currency of 13.5% were offset by a
negative currency impact of 4.1%. Worldwide growth reflected the strong
performance of PROCRIT, RISPERDAL, DURAGESIC, LEVAQUIN, and the oral
contraceptive line of products.
Significant research activities continued in the Pharmaceutical
segment, increasing to $2.5 billion or 16.6% of sales in 2001. This representsan increase of 18.6% over 2000 and a compound annual growth rate of
approximately 13.6% for the five-year period since 1996. Johnson & Johnson
Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C., formerly known as the Janssen
Research Foundation and the R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute, is
the worldwide pharmaceutical research organization with additional research
conducted by Centocor, ALZA and through a collaboration with the James Black
Foundation in London, England.
MEDICAL DEVICES & DIAGNOSTICS
The Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment includes a broad range of products
used by or under the direction of health care professionals. These include
suture and mechanical wound closure products, surgical equipment and devices,
wound management and infection prevention products, interventional and
diagnostic cardiology products, diagnostic equipment and supplies, joint
replacements and disposable contact lenses. These products are used principally
in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, therapists, hospitals,
diagnostic laboratories and clinics. Acquisitions in the Medical Devices &
Diagnostics segment during recent years have been an integral part of an ongoing
process to transform this segment from what was once principally a medical
supply business to one serving a range of higher technology medical specialties.

<PAGE>
Worldwide sales in 2001 of $11.2 billion in the Medical Devices &
Diagnostics segment represented an increase of 8.9% over 2000. Domestic sales
were up 12.2%, while international sales increased 5.0% as sales gains in local
currency of 12.0% were offset by a negative currency impact of 7.0%. Worldwide
sales gains in local currency of 12.1% were reduced by 3.2% due to the strength
of the U.S. dollar. Strong sales growth from Cordis' circulatory disease
management products; DePuy's orthopaedic joint reconstruction and spinal
products; Ethicon's wound closure, surgical sports medicine and women's health
products; Ethicon Endo-Surgery's minimally invasive surgical and vascular access
products, and LifeScan's blood glucose monitoring products were the primary
contributors to the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment growth.
In the fourth quarter of 2001, Cordis announced the FDA approval of the
Bx VELOCITY Coronary Stent with HEPACOAT on the RAPTORRAIL Stent Delivery System
(rapid exchange). The stent is coated with heparin, a blood-thinning agent used
to reduce the risk of clot formation. In addition, Cordis completed the
acquisition of TERAMed, Inc., a privately held company developing a proprietary,
catheter-based system for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms.
In November 2001, the Company completed the acquisition of Inverness
Medical Technology, a manufacturer and developer of advanced blood glucose
monitoring products. Inverness is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson &
Johnson and together with Johnson & Johnson's LifeScan business unit forms our
leading blood glucose monitoring franchise.Inverness Medical Technology was
acquired in order to provide technology for the development of future products.
Additionally, Vistakon introduced ACUVUE 2 COLOURS Brand Contact
Lenses, which provides exceptional comfort and handling in a soft frequent
replacement color contact lens. ACUVUE 2 COLOURS is a two-week, daily wear lens
available with or without vision correction in seven natural-looking colors. The
unique COLOURS-WRAPPED-IN-COMFORT design eliminates the color touching the eye,
while offering natural color depth.
Worldwide sales in 2000 of $10.3 billion in the Medical Devices &
Diagnostics segment represented an increase of 3.7% over 1999. Domestic sales
were up 4.0%, while international sales increased 3.4% as sales gains in local
currency of 10.3% were offset by a negative currency impact of 6.9%. Worldwide
sales gains in local currency of 6.9% were reduced by 3.2% due to the strength
of the U.S. dollar. Strong sales growth from Cordis' coronary and endovascular
stents, DePuy's spinal products, Ethicon's MITEK suture anchors and Gynecare's
women's health products, Ethicon Endo-Surgery's MAMMOTOME breast biopsy system
and ULTRACISION Harmonic Scalpel and Vistakon's disposable contact lens products
were the primary contributors to the Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment
growth.
Worldwide sales in 1999 of $9.9 billion in the Medical Devices &
Diagnostics segment represented an increase of 15.7% over 1998. Domestic sales
increased 16.9%, while international sales gains in local currency of 15.7% were
partially offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar. In the fourth quarter,
Cordis launched the new Bx VELOCITY coronary stent in Europe, where it has been
well received by the medical community. Ethicon's new products included: PRONOVA
Poly (hexafluoropropylene-VDF) Suture, a synthetic nonabsorbable monofilament
for cardiovascular and vascular surgery and SURGIFOAM Absorbable Gelatin Sponge
USP, which has been proven in surgery for over 50 years in Europe and has givenEthicon a full line of hemostasis products. In 1999, Ethicon also received
approval for Gynecare's THERMACHOICE II Uterine Balloon Therapy System, the
latex-free next generation ablation technology system used for excessive uterine
bleeding.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash generated from operations and selected borrowings provides the major source
of funds for the growth of the business, including working capital, additions to
property, plant and equipment and acquisitions. Cash and current marketable
securities totaled $8.0 billion at the end of 2001 as compared with $6.8 billion
at the end of 2000. For the year ended December 30, 2001, there was a change in
the timing of salary increases and bonuses to employees from December 2001 to
February 2002. This change was enacted to have 2001 results finalized in order
to align compensation and performance. The result of this change was an increase
of approximately $450 million in accrued salaries, wages and commissions in the
balance sheet at December 30, 2001 and results in a corresponding increase in
cash flows from operating activities.
Total unused credit available to the Company approximates $3.0 billion,
including $1.5 billion of credit commitments with various banks worldwide that
expire on October 3, 2002. The Company's shelf registration filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission enables the Company to issue up to $2.6
billion of unsecured debt securities and warrants to purchase debt securities
under its medium term note (MTN) program. No MTNs were issued in 2001. At
December 30, 2001, the Company had $1.8 billion remaining on its shelf
registration. The Company continues to be one of a few companies with a Triple A
credit rating.Total borrowings at the end of 2001 and 2000 were $2.8 billion and $4.7
billion, respectively. In 2001 net cash (cash and current marketable securities
net of debt) was $5.2 billion. In 2000, net cash (cash and current marketable
securities net of debt) was $2.1 billion. Total debt represented 10.3% of total
capital (shareowners' equity and total debt) in 2001 and 18.6% of total capital
in 2000. Shareowners' equity per share at the end of 2001 was $7.95 compared
with $6.77 at year-end 2000, an increase of 17.4%. For the period ended December
30, 2001, there were no material cash commitments. A summary of borrowings can
be found in Note 6.
On February 13, 2002, the Company announced a stock repurchase program
of up to $5 billion with no time limit on this program.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange
rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign
exchange contracts to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and
liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency product costs. Gains or losses
on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying
transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from December 30, 2001
market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company's forward
contracts by $233 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar
from December 30, 2001 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the
Company's forward contracts by $285 million. In either scenario, the gain or
loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the
underlying transaction and therefore would have no impact on future earnings and
cash flows.
The Company enters into currency swap contracts to manage the Company's
exposure to changes in currency exchange rates and hedge foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities. The impact of a 1% change in interest rates
on the Company's interest rate sensitive financial instruments would be
immaterial.
The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into
contracts with parties that have at least an "A" (or equivalent) credit rating.
The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and the
Company does not have significant exposure to any one counterparty. Management
believes the risk of loss is remote.
CHANGING PRICES AND INFLATION
Johnson & Johnson is aware that its products are used in a setting where, for
more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed
concern about the rising cost of health care. In response to these concerns,
Johnson & Johnson has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly.
For the period 1991 - 2001, in the United States, the weighted average compound
annual growth rate of Johnson & Johnson price increases for health care products
(prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products)
was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the period.
Inflation rates, even though moderate in many parts of the world during
2001, continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on
the way companies operate. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives
to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity
improvements and periodic price increases.
KEY ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
As previously described, the Company is engaged in the manufacture and sale of
products in the healthcare field. Due to the nature of the business, it is
unlikely that any accounting policies, that are open to interpretation, could
have a material effect on the Company's results of operations. Certain key
accounting policies that may affect the results of the Company are the timing of
revenue recognition and the fact that all research and development expenses are
expensed as incurred. Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements describes
the Company's other significant accounting policies.
During 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus
on "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives" (EITF 00-14) that addresses the
recognition, measurement and statement of earnings classification of certain
sales incentives. Additionally, EITF Issue No. 00-25 "Vendor Income Statement
Characterization of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products"
(EITF 00-25) addresses the classification in
30<PAGE>
the statement of earnings of consideration from a vendor to an entity that
purchases the vendor's products for resale. These pronouncements are effective
beginning with the first quarter of 2002. The impact of these pronouncements on
the Company's financial statements will result in a corresponding reduction in
sales and expenses estimated at $160 million, $132 million and $132 million for
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, for EITF 00-14, and $518 million, $533
million and $518 million for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, for EITF 00-25.
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
pronouncement SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141) which requires
that the purchase method of accounting must be used for all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and eliminates the use of the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting. SFAS 141 also further clarifies the
criteria for recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill. SFAS No.
142, "Goodwill and other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142) effective January 1, 2002
was also issued by the FASB in June 2001. SFAS No. 142 eliminates the
amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and initiates an
annual review for impairment. Identifiable intangible assets with a determinable
useful life will continue to be amortized while the amortization of goodwill and
other intangible assets acquired prior to June 30, 2001 will be eliminated upon
adoption of SFAS 142. The rules established by SFAS 142 were applied immediately
to goodwill and other intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001. See Notes
7 and 17 for additional information.
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations" which addresses the accounting and reporting of an
entity's legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets
due to an acquisition, development or normal operation of the asset. The
pronouncement is effective for the fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2002. In
October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" (SFAS 144) that is effective for the first
quarter of 2002. SFAS 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the
impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No.
121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of" and the accounting and reporting provisions of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of
Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and
Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions" for
segments of a business to be disposed of as previously defined in that Opinion.
The implementations of SFAS 143 and SFAS 144 are not expected to have a material
effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
COMMON STOCK MARKET PRICES
The Company's common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the

CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS
This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and anticipate
results based on management's plans that are subject to uncertainty.
Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words like "plans,"
"expects," "will," "anticipates," "estimates" and other words of similar meaning
in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations,
financial performance, the Company's strategy for growth, product development,
regulatory approval, market position and expenditures.
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future
events. The Company cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be
accurate, although the Company believes that it has been reasonable in its
expectations and assumptions. Investors should realize that if underlying
assumptions prove inaccurate or that unknown risks or uncertainties materialize,
actual results could vary materially from the Company's expectations and
projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on
any forward-looking statements. Furthermore, the Company assumes no obligation
to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or
future events or developments. The Company's report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 30, 2001 that will be filed in March 2002, will contain, as an
Exhibit, a discussion of various factors that could cause actual results to
differ from expectations. Prior to that filing, investors should reference the
Company's report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000. The
Company notes these factors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements of Johnson & Johnson have been prepared to
give retroactive effect to the merger with ALZA Corporation (ALZA) on June 22,
2001.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and
subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers securities with maturities of three months or less, when
purchased, to be cash equivalents.
INVESTMENTS
Short-term marketable securities are carried at cost, which approximates fair
value. Long-term debt securities that the Company has the ability and intent to
hold until maturity are carried at amortized cost, which also approximates fair
value. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at estimated
fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. Management determines the appropriate
classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of
purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date.
PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the
straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the
assets:
<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Building and building equipment 20-40 years
Land and leasehold improvements 10-20 years
Machinery and equipment 2-13 years
</TABLE>
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the goods are shipped or
delivered and title passes to the customer.SALES INCENTIVES AND TRADE PROMOTIONAL ALLOWANCES
The Company currently recognizes the expense related to coupons, certain sales
incentives and trade promotions upon issuance and classifies these expenses as
selling, marketing and administrative expense. The Company will adopt EITF
Issues No. 00-14 and No. 00-25, which are effective beginning with the first
quarter of 2002. The impact on the Company is a reclassification from expense to
a reduction of sales of $160 million, $132 million and $132 million for 2001,
2000 and 1999 for EITF No. 00-14, and $518 million, $533 million and $518
million for 2001, 2000 and 1999 for EITF No. 00-25.
SHIPPING AND HANDLING
Shipping and handling costs incurred were $473 million, $492 million and $470
million in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively, and are included in selling,
marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for
shipping and handling is immaterial for all periods presented.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined by the
first-in, first-out method.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
For acquisitions completed on or before June 30, 2001, the excess of the cost
over the fair value of net assets of purchased businesses is recorded as
goodwill and is amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 40 years or
less. The cost of other acquired intangibles is amortized on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company continually evaluates the
carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Any impairments would be
recognized when the expected future operating cash flows derived from such
intangible assets is less than their carrying value.
The Company has adopted SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," and SFAS
No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." All business combinations
consummated after July 1, 2001 are accounted for in accordance with the new
pronouncements. Goodwill relating to acquisitions completed subsequent to June
30, 2001 is not amortized and is subject to impairment testing. In addition,
effective January 1, 2002, the Company will no longer be required to amortize
goodwill and certain other intangible assets relating to acquisitions completed
prior to July 1, 2001.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended by SFAS No. 138
"Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities,
an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133," collectively referred to as SFAS 133.
SFAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance
sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each
period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether
the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if it is,
depending on the type of hedge transaction.
The Company uses forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to
the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate
changes of future product purchases denominated in foreign currency. The Company
also uses currency swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to
borrowings. Both of these types of derivatives are designated as cash flow
hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward exchange contracts to offset its
exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward
exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the
fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting
the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and
liabilities.
The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the later of the date
of entering into the derivative contract or January 1, 2001. At inception, all
derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Changes in the fair value of a
derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge and that is highly effective,
are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, until the underlying
transaction affects earnings and are then reclassed to earnings in the same
account as the hedged transaction. Fair value of a forward exchange contract
represents the present value of the change in forward exchange rates times the
notional amount of the derivative. The fair value of a currency swap contract is
determined by discounting to the present all future cash flows of the currencies
to be exchanged
36
<PAGE>
at interest rates prevailing in the market for the periods the currencyexchanges are due, and expressing the result in U.S. dollars at the current spot
foreign currency exchange rate.
At inception, and on an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether
each derivative is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the
cash flows of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be
highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Hedge ineffectiveness, if
any, is included in current period earnings.
The Company documents all relationships between hedged items and
derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for
undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of
this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure's impact on the
Company's financial performance; (2) protect the Company's cash flow from
adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of
financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with
financial institutions.
ADVERTISING
Costs associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred. Advertising
expenses worldwide, which are comprised of television, radio, print media as
well as Internet advertising, were $1.43 billion in 2001, $1.37 billion in 2000
and $1.43 billion in 1999.
INCOME TAXES
The Company intends to continue to reinvest its undistributed international
earnings to expand its international operations; therefore no tax has been
provided to cover the repatriation of such undistributed earnings. At December
30, 2001, and December 31, 2000, the cumulative amount of undistributed
international earnings was approximately $12.1 billion and $9.5 billion,
respectively.
NET EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common
shareowners by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could
occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported.
Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.
ANNUAL CLOSING DATE
The Company follows the concept of a fiscal year which ends on the Sunday
nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists
of 52 weeks, but every five or six years, as was the case in 1998, the fiscal
year consists of 53 weeks.
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year
presentation.
STOCK SPLIT
On April 26, 2001, the Board of Directors declared a 2-for-1 stock split.
Shareowners of record at the close of business on May 22, 2001 were issued one
additional share of Johnson & Johnson common stock on June 12, 2001 for each
share held as of the record date. All shares and per share data for all periods
presented in these financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the stock
split.
2 INVENTORIES

was $95 million, $97 million and $84 million, respectively.
Upon retirement or other disposal of fixed assets, the cost and related
amount of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset
and accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any,
between the net asset value and the proceeds is adjusted to earnings.
4 RENTAL EXPENSE AND LEASE COMMITMENTS
Rentals of space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and office and data
processing equipment under operating leases amounted to approximately $275
million in 2001, $264 million in 2000 and $245 million in 1999.

The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous
banks worldwide. Total unused credit available to the Company approximates $3.0
billion, including $1.5 billion of credit commitments with various banks
worldwide that expire on October 3, 2002. Interest charged on borrowings under
the credit line agreements is based on either bids provided by the banks, the
prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), plus applicable margins.
Commitment fees under the agreements are not material.
The Company's shelf registration filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission enables the Company to issue up to $2.6 billion of unsecured debt
securities and warrants to purchase debt securities under its medium term note
(MTN) program. No MTN's were issued in 2001. At December 30, 2001, the Company
had $1.8 billion remaining on its shelf registration.
Long term debt includes convertible subordinated debentures issued by
Centocor and ALZA prior to their respective mergers with Johnson & Johnson.
With respect to the 4.75% Convertible Subordinated Debentures which
were originally issued by Centocor, the Company exercised its option to redeem
the debentures and set February 21, 2001 as the redemption date, at a price
equal to 102.714% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. The debentures
were converted by the holders into approximately 11.9 million shares of Johnson& Johnson stock at a conversion price of $38.546 per share.
On July 28, 2000, ALZA completed a private offering of the 3% Zero
Coupon Convertible Subordinated Debentures which were issued at a price of
$551.26 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. At December 30, 2001, the
outstanding 3% Debentures had a total principal amount at maturity of $1.1
billion with a yield to maturity of 3% per annum, computed on a semiannual bond
equivalent basis. There are no periodic interest payments. Under the terms of
the 3% debentures, holders are entitled to convert their debentures into
approximately 15.0 million shares of Johnson & Johnson stock at a price of
$40.102 per share. Approximately 21,000 shares have been issued as of December
30, 2001 due to voluntary conversions by note holders. At the option of the
holder, the 3% Debentures may be repurchased by the Company on July 28, 2003,
2008 or 2013, at a purchase price equal to the issue price plus accreted
original issue discount to such purchase date. The Company, at its option, may
elect to deliver either Johnson & Johnson common stock or cash, or a combination
of stock and cash, in the event of repurchase of the 3% Debentures. The Company,
at its option, may also redeem any or all of the 3% Debentures after July 28,
2003 at the issue price plus accreted original issue discount. At December 30,
2001 and December 31, 2000, the fair value based on quoted market value of the
3% Debentures was $909.9 million and $759.8 million, respectively.
In 1994, ALZA issued the 5.25% Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated
Debentures at a price of $354.71 per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. At
December 30, 2001, the outstanding 5.25% Debentures had a total principal amount
at maturity of $223.7 million, with a yield to maturity of 5.25% per annum,
computed on a semiannual bond equivalent basis. There are no periodic interest
payments. Under the terms of the debentures, note holders are entitled to
convert their debentures into approximately 24.0 million shares of Johnson &
Johnson stock at a price of $13.939 per share. Approximately 18.3 million shares
of Johnson & Johnson stock have been issued as at December 30, 2001 due to
voluntary conversions by note holders. At the option of the holder, the 5.25%
Debentures may be purchased by the Company on July 14, 2004 or July 14, 2009, at
a purchase price equal to the issue price plus accreted

original issue discount to such purchase date. The Company, at its option, may
elect to deliver either common stock or cash in the event of conversion or
purchase of the 5.25% Debentures. The Company, at its option, may also redeem
any or all of the 5.25% Debentures for cash after July 14, 1999 at a redemption
price equal to the issue price plus accreted original issue discount. At
December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the fair value based on quoted market
value of the 5.25% Debentures was $339.2 million and $1,038.3 million,
respectively.
Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt amounted to
$565 million at the end of 2001. These borrowings are comprised of the $200
million 7.375% notes and $365 million of local borrowings, principally by
international subsidiaries.

intangible assets above include $1.6 billion related to acquisitions completed
after June 30, 2001 that have been accounted for under the new provision of SFAS
141 and SFAS 142. The effect of implementation of these new provisions on the
intangibles recorded prior to June 30, 2001 will be a reduction of amortization
expense of approximately $120 million, prospectively. Refer to Note 17 for

Deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences of "temporary
differences" by applying enacted statutory tax rates, applicable to future
years, to differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of
existing assets and liabilities.

9 INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY TRANSLATION
For translation of its non-U.S. dollar currencies, the Company has determined
that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional
currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as
those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more
during the past three years.
In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency
effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
This equity account includes the results of translating all balance sheet assets
and liabilities at current exchange rates, except for those located in highly
inflationary economies which are reflected in operating results.
An analysis of the changes during 2001 and 2000 for foreign currency
translation adjustments is included in Note 11.

10 COMMON STOCK, STOCK OPTION PLANS AND STOCK COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS
At December 30, 2001 the Company had 24 stock-based compensation plans. Under
the 2000 Stock Option Plan, the Company may grant options to its employees for
up to 1.6% of the issued shares of the Company's Common Stock, plus the number
of shares available from the previous year that were not issued, as well as
shares issued under the Plan that expired or terminated without being exercised.
The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 1991, 1995 and 2000
Employee Stock Option Plans, the 1997 Non-Employee Director's Plan and the
Mitek, Cordis, Biosense, Gynecare, Centocor, Innovasive Devices, ALZA and
Inverness Stock Option plans.
Stock options expire 10 years from the date they are granted and vest
over service periods that range from one to six years. All options are granted
at current market price on the date of grant. Shares available, under the 2000
Stock Option Plan, for future grants are based on 1.6% of the issued shares each
year, and 49.9 million shares could be granted each year during the years 2002
through 2005, in addition to any other available shares as described above.
Shares available for future grants under the 2000 plan were 57.0 million, at theend of 2001.
A summary of the status of the Company's stock option plans as of
December 30, 2001, December 31, 2000 and January 2, 2000 and changes during the
years ending on those dates, is presented below:

For the year ended December 30, 2001, there was a change in the timing of
granting stock compensation and options to employees from December 2001 to
February 2002. This change was enacted to have 2001 results finalized in order
to align compensation with performance.
The Company applies the provision of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," that calls for companies to
measure employee stock compensation expense based on the fair value method of
accounting. However, as allowed by the Statement, the Company elected continued
use of Accounting Principle Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees," with pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per
share determined as if the fair value method had been applied in measuring
compensation cost. Had the fair value method been applied, net income would have
been reduced by $263 million or $.08 per share in 2001, $189 million or $.06 per
share in 2000 and $140 million or $.05 per share in 1999. These calculations
only take into account the options issued since January 1, 1995. The average
fair value of options granted was $13.72 in 2001, $14.79 in 2000 and $15.00 in
1999. The fair value was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model
based on the weighted average assumptions of:

Total other comprehensive income for 2001 includes reclassification adjustment
gains of $21 million realized from the sale of equity securities and the
associated tax expense of $7 million. In 2000, total other comprehensive income
included reclassification adjustment gains of $80 million realized from the sale
of equity securities and the associated tax expense of $28 million. In 1999,
total other comprehensive income included reclassification adjustment losses of
$18 million and the associated tax benefit of $7 million.
The tax effect on these unrealized gains/(losses) on equity securities
is an expense of $64 million in 2001, $53 million in 2000 and $48 million in1999. The tax effect on the gains/(losses) on derivatives and hedges is an
expense of $53 million in 2001. See Note 15 for additional information relating
to derivatives and hedging.
The currency translation adjustments are not currently adjusted for
income taxes as they relate to permanent investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries.

13 RETIREMENT AND PENSION PLANS
The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined
benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most
employees worldwide. The Company also provides postretirement benefits,
primarily health care to all domestic retired employees and their dependents.
Most international employees are covered by government sponsored
programs and the cost to the Company is not significant.
Retirement plan benefits are primarily based on the employee's
compensation during the last three to five years before retirement and the
number of years of service. The Company's objective in funding its domestic
plans is to accumulate funds sufficient to provide for all accrued benefits.
International subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with
trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts or reserves are
provided.
In certain countries other than the United States, the funding of
pension plans is not a common practice as funding provides no economic benefit.
Consequently, the Company has several pension plans which are not funded.
The Company does not fund retiree health care benefits in advance and
has the right to modify these plans in the future.
Net periodic benefit costs for the Company's defined benefit retirement
plans and other benefit plans for 2001, 2000 and 1999 include the following
components:

effect of a 1% change in these assumed cost trends on the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation at the end of 2001 would be a $96 million
increase or a $79 million decrease and the effect on the service and interest
cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2001 would
be a $12 million increase or a $9 million decrease.

15 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 133 requiring that allderivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. On
January 1, 2001 the Company recorded a $17 million net-of-tax cumulative effect
transition adjustment gain in accumulated other comprehensive income to
recognize at fair value all derivative instruments designated as cash flow
hedges. The adjustment to net earnings was immaterial.
As of December 30, 2001 the balance of deferred net gains on
derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $98 million
(after tax). Of this amount, the Company expects that $95 million will be
reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions
that are expected to occur over that period. The amount ultimately realized in
earnings will differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses
are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the
derivative. The primary types of underlying transactions which will cause the
amount in accumulated other comprehensive income to affect net earnings
primarily consist of sales to third parties. The maximum length of time over
which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash
flows for forecasted transactions is 15 months.
For the year ended December 30, 2001 the net impact of the hedges'
ineffectiveness to the Company's financial statements was insignificant. For the
year ended December 30, 2001 the Company has recorded a net gain of $2 million
(after tax) in the "other (income) expense, net" category of the consolidated
statement of earnings, representing the impact of discontinuance of cash flow
hedges because it is probable that the originally forecasted transactions will
not occur by the end of the originally specified time period.
Refer to Note 11 for disclosures of movements in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company invests its excess cash in both deposits with major banks throughout
the world and other high quality short-term liquid money market instruments.
Refer to Note 14 for additional information. The Company has a policy of making
investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an "A" (or
equivalent) credit rating. These investments generally mature within six months
and the Company has not incurred any related losses. The Company sells a broad
range of products in the health care field in most countries of the world.
Ongoing credit evaluations of customers' financial condition are performed and,
generally, no collateral is required. In 2001, sales to three distributors
accounted for a total of 30.9% of total Company revenues. The Company maintains
reserves for potential credit losses and such losses, in the aggregate, have not
exceeded management's expectations.
16 SAVINGS PLAN
The Company has voluntary 401(k) savings plans designed to enhance the existing
retirement programs covering eligible employees. The Company matches a
percentage of each employee's contributions consistent with the provisions of
the plan for which he/she is eligible.
In the U.S. salaried plan, one-third of the Company match is paid in
Company stock under an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). In 1990, to
establish the ESOP, the Company
44
<PAGE>
loaned $100 million to the ESOP Trust to purchase shares of the Company stock on
the open market. In exchange, the Company received a note, the balance of which
is recorded as a reduction of shareowners' equity.
Total contributions to the plans were $96 million in 2001, $81 million
in 2000, and $73 million in 1999.
17 MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS
On June 22, 2001, Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation (ALZA) completed the
merger between the two companies. This transaction was accounted for as a
pooling-of-interests. ALZA had approximately 239 million shares outstanding (286
million on a fully diluted basis) that were exchanged for approximately 234
million shares of Johnson & Johnson common stock. On a diluted basis when
adjusted for stock options and convertible debt, the total number of Johnson &
Johnson shares issued total approximately 280 million shares. Holders of ALZA
common stock received 0.98 of a share of Johnson & Johnson common stock, valued
at $52.39 per share.
ALZA is a research-based pharmaceutical company with leading drugdelivery technologies. The company applies its delivery technologies to develop
pharmaceutical products with enhanced therapeutic value for its own portfolio
and for many of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies.
The financial statements have been prepared to give retroactive effect
to Johnson & Johnson's merger with ALZA. The only adjustments to ALZA's
historical financial statements have been the reflection of income tax expense
as if the companies had been combined for all periods presented, the elimination
of transactions with Johnson & Johnson affiliate companies and the
reclassification of certain amounts to conform with Johnson & Johnson
presentation. For the first quarter of 2001, the revenue and net earnings for
Johnson & Johnson prior to the merger with ALZA were $7.8 billion and $1.5
billion, respectively. For the first quarter of 2001, the revenue and net
earnings of ALZA included in Johnson & Johnson's financial results were $230
million for revenue and $52 million for net earnings. For 2000 and 1999, the
revenue and net earnings of Johnson & Johnson prior to the merger with ALZA were
$29.1 billion and $27.5 billion, respectively for revenue and $4.8 billion and
$4.2 billion, respectively for net earnings. For 2000 and 1999, the revenue and
net earnings of ALZA included in Johnson & Johnson's financial results were $707
million and $536 million, respectively for revenue and $153 million and $106
million, respectively for net earnings. For the year ended December 30, 2001,
the Company incurred $147 million pretax ($126 million after tax) costs
associated with the ALZA merger. Such costs are included in other
(income)/expense, net.
Certain businesses were acquired for $1.7 billion during 2001 ($326
million in cash and debt assumed and approximately 24.5 million shares of the
Company's common stock issuable from Treasury valued at $1.4 billion). These
acquisitions were accounted for by the purchase method and, accordingly, results
of operations have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
The 2001 acquisitions included Inverness Medical Technology, the
supplier of LifeScan's electrochemical products for blood glucose monitoring
following the spin-off of the non-diabetes businesses; Heartport, a company that
develops and manufactures products for less invasive open chest and minimally
invasive heart operations, including stopped heart and beating heart procedures;
TERAMed Inc., an early-stage medical device company that is developing
endovascular stent-graft systems for the minimally invasive treatment of
abdominal aortic aneurysms and peripheral occlusive disease; Babycenter.com, an
internet content and commerce site devoted to supporting a community of
expectant and new mothers; and the VIACTIV product line, a chewable calcium
supplement, from the Mead Johnson Nutritionals Division of Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Inverness Medical Technology was acquired to enhance control of a
primary supplier of LifeScan blood glucose monitoring products and will allow
for the achievement of operational synergies. The acquisition also provides key
technology for the development of future products. The preliminary purchase
price allocation includes current assets of $45 million, property, plant and
equipment of $31 million, current liabilities of $44 million, deferred tax
liabilities of $274 million and long term debt of $66 million. The goodwill and
intangible assets acquired included $784 million of patents and technology that
will be amortized over a period of 20 years or less at an annual amortization of
$45 million per year and goodwill of $714 million. In accordance with SFAS No.
142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," this goodwill will not be amortized
and is not deductible for tax purposes.
Approximately $105 million has been identified as the value of
in-process research and development (IPR&D) associated with the Inverness
Medical Technology and TERAMed Inc. acquisitions. The IPR&D charge is primarily
related to Inverness projects for minimally invasive testing, continuous
monitoring and insulin delivery. The value of the IPR&D was calculated with the
assistance of a third party appraiser using cash flow projections discounted for
the risk inherent in such projects using probability of success factors ranging
from 25 - 40%. The discount rate used was 12%.
Pro forma information is not provided since the impact of the
acquisitions does not have a material effect on the Company's results of
operations, cash flows or financial position.
Certain businesses were acquired for $241 million during 2000 ($156
million in cash and debt assumed and approximately 1.8 million shares of the
Company's common stock issued from Treasury valued at $77 million). These
acquisitions were accounted for by the purchase method and, accordingly, results
of operations have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements from their respective dates of acquisitions.
The 2000 acquisitions included Crescendo, a company formed by ALZA for
the purpose of selecting, developing and commercializing human pharmaceutical
products; Innovasive Devices, a company that manufactures and sells devices for
sports medicine surgery for soft tissue injuries; Atrionix, Inc., a developmentstage company whose primary product is a pulmonary ablation catheter for the
treatment of atrial fibrillation; Medtrex, a company that develops and
manufactures electrosurgical generators and disposable products, and the ST.
JOSEPH aspirin business.
45
<PAGE>
The IPR&D writeoff associated with the Atrionix, Inc. and ALZA's
Crescendo acquisition was $66 million. The IPR&D charge is primarily related to
an Atrionix project for the design of a catheter system to be used in a
procedure which blocks electrical impulses originating in pulmonary veins, which
can cause atrial fibrillation. The value of the IPR&D was calculated with the
assistance of a third party appraiser using a cash flow projection discounted
for the risk inherent in such a project. The discount rate used was 26%.
Divestitures in 2001 and 2000 did not have a material effect on the
Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
18 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company is involved in numerous product liability cases in the United
States, many of which concern adverse reactions to drugs and medical devices.
The damages claimed are substantial, and while the Company is confident of the
adequacy of the warnings and instructions for use which accompany such products,
it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. However, the
Company believes that if any liability results from such cases, it will be
substantially covered by reserves established under its self-insurance program
and by commercially available excess liability insurance.
One group of cases against the Company concerns the Janssen
Pharmaceutica product PROPULSID, which was withdrawn from general sale and
restricted to limited use in 2000. In the wake of publicity about those events,
more than 950 lawsuits, comprising the claims of more than 3,700 named
individuals, have been filed against Janssen, which is a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company, and the Company regarding PROPULSID in state and federal courts
across the country. Approximately 2,700 of these plaintiffs claim to have taken
PROPULSID; the rest are derivative plaintiffs, such as spouses. Claims have been
filed that 327 of these patients have died from the use of PROPULSID. A
significant number of these cases also seek certification as class actions.
These actions accuse Janssen and the Company of inadequately testing for and
warning about the drug's side effects, of promoting it for off-label use and of
over-promotion. These actions seek substantial compensatory and punitive
damages. In addition, Janssen and the Company have entered into agreements with
various plaintiffs' counsel halting the running of the statutes of limitations
with respect to the potential claims of a significant number of individuals
while those attorneys evaluate whether or not to sue Janssen and the Company on
their behalf. In September 2001, the first 10 plaintiffs in the Rankin case,
which comprises the claims of 155 plaintiffs, went to trial in state court in
Claiborne County, Mississippi. The jury returned compensatory damage verdicts
for each plaintiff in the amount of $10 million, for a total of $100 million.
The trial judge thereafter dismissed the claims of punitive damages. Janssen and
the Company believe these verdicts are insupportable and will be reduced on post
trial motions and reversed on appeal. In the view of Janssen and the Company,
the proof at trial demonstrated that none of these plaintiffs was injured by
PROPULSID and that no basis for liability existed. With respect to all the
various PROPULSID actions against them, Janssen and the Company dispute the
claims in those lawsuits and are vigorously defending against them except where,
in their judgement, settlement is appropriate. Janssen and the Company believe
they have adequate self and commercially available excess insurance with respect
to these cases.
The Company's Ortho Biotech subsidiary is party to an arbitration
proceeding filed against it in 1995 by Amgen, Ortho Biotech's licensor of U.S.
non-dialysis rights to PROCRIT/EPREX, in which Amgen seeks to terminate Ortho
Biotech's U.S. license rights and collect substantial damages based on alleged
deliberate PROCRIT/EPREX sales by Ortho Biotech during the early 1990's into
Amgen's reserved dialysis market. The Company believes no basis exists for
terminating Ortho Biotech's U.S. license rights or for obtaining damages and is
vigorously contesting Amgen's claims. However, Ortho Biotech's U.S. license
rights to PROCRIT/EPREX are material to the Company; thus, an unfavorable
outcome on the termination issue could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.
The arbitration began in January, 2002 and is expected to conclude in April,
2002. The arbitrator's decision will follow the submission of post-hearing
briefs by both sides.
The Company and its LifeScan subsidiary were defendants in several
class actions filed in federal and state courts in California in 1998 in which
it is alleged that purchasers of SURESTEP blood glucose meters and stripssuffered economic harm because those products contained undisclosed defects. In
late 2000, LifeScan pleaded guilty in federal court to three misdemeanors and
paid a total of $60 million in fines and civil costs to resolve an investigation
related to those same alleged defects. In December 2001 all these actions were
settled and the settlement has been preliminarily approved by the Federal
District Court. The settlement has been accounted for by the Company and is not
material.
In patent infringement actions tried in Delaware Federal Court in late
2000, Cordis, a Johnson & Johnson company, obtained verdicts of infringement and
patent validity, and damage awards, against Boston Scientific Corporation and
Medtronic AVE, Inc., based on a number of Cordis coronary stent patents. On
December 15, 2000, the jury in the damage action against Boston Scientific
returned a verdict of $324 million and on December 21, 2000 the jury in the
Medtronic AVE action returned a verdict of $271 million. These sums represent
lost profit and reasonable royalty damages to compensate Cordis for infringement
but do not include pre or post judgment interest. In February 2001 a hearing was
held on the claims of Boston Scientific and Medtronic AVE that the patents at
issue are unenforceable owing to alleged inequitable conduct before the patent
office. Post trial motions and appeals to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals
will follow and no judgments are likely to be paid, if at all, until those
proceedings have run their course. Furthermore, since the amount of damages, if
any, which the Company may receive cannot be quantified until the legal process
is complete, no gain has been recorded in the financial statements for either of
these awards.
The Company is also involved in a number of patent, trademark and other
lawsuits incidental to its business.

The Company believes that the above proceedings, except as noted above,
would not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash
flows or financial position.
19 EARNINGS PER SHARE
The following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net

Diluted earnings per share calculation includes the dilution effect of
convertible debt: a decrease in interest expense of $25 million, $47 million and
$48 million after tax for years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
Diluted earnings per share excludes 1 million shares, 62 million shares
and 24 million shares of options for the year 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively,
as the exercise price of these options was greater than their average market
value, resulting in an anti-dilutive effect on diluted earnings per share.

The statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, and include amounts that are
based on our best judgments with due consideration given to materiality.
Management maintains a system of internal accounting controls monitored
by a corporate staff of professionally trained internal auditors who travel
worldwide. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance, at
reasonable cost, that assets are safeguarded and that transactions and events
are recorded properly. While the Company is organized on the principle of
decentralized management, appropriate control measures are also evidenced by
well-defined organizational responsibilities, management selection, development
and evaluation processes, communicative techniques, financial planning and
reporting systems and formalized procedures.
It has always been the policy and practice of the Company to conduct
its affairs ethically and in a socially responsible manner. This responsibility

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
To the Shareowners and Board of Directors of
Johnson & Johnson:
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, consolidated statements of equity and
consolidated statements of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Johnson & Johnson and subsidiaries at December 30,
2001 and December 31, 2000, and the results of their operations and their cashflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2001, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

<DESCRIPTION>CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
<TEXT>
<PAGE>
EXHIBIT 99(b)
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM
ACT OF 1995 -- "SAFE HARBOR" FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The Company may from time to time make certain forward-looking statements
in publicly-released materials, both written and oral. Forward-looking
statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and anticipate
results based on management's plans that are subject to uncertainty.
Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words like "plans,"
"expects," "will," "anticipates," "estimates" and other words of similar meaning
in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations,
financial performance, the Company's strategy for growth, product development,
regulatory approvals, market position and expenditures.
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of future
events. The Company cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be
accurate, although the Company believes that it has been reasonable in its
expectations and assumptions. Investors should realize that if underlying
assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize,
actual results could vary materially from the Company's expectations and
projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on
any forward-looking statements. Furthermore, the Company assumes no obligation
to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or
future events or developments.
Some important factors that could cause the Company's actual results to
differ from the Company's expectations in any forward-looking statements are as
follows:
Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in interest
rates and foreign currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such
fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins;
Competitive factors, including technological advances achieved and
patents attained by competitors and challenges by competitors to the
Company's patents;
Domestic and foreign health care changes resulting in pricing
pressures, including the continued consolidation among health care
providers, trends toward managed care and health care cost containment and
government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion,
reimbursement and pricing generally;
Government laws and regulations, affecting domestic and foreign
operations, including those relating to trade, monetary and fiscal
policies, taxes, price controls, regulatory approval of new products,
licensing and patent rights;
Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement
of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant and
results from time to time in product and process obsolescence. The
development of new and improved products is important to the Company's
success in all areas of its business;
Difficulties inherent in product development, including the potential
inability to successfully continue technological innovation, complete
clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals in the United States and
abroad, gain and maintain market approval of products and the possibility
of encountering infringement claims by competitors with respect to patent
or other intellectual property rights which can preclude or delay
commercialization of a product;Significant litigation adverse to the Company including product
liability claims, patent infringement claims, and antitrust claims, as well
as the arbitration proceeding filed by Amgen to terminate U.S. license
rights;
Product efficacy or safety concerns resulting in product recalls,
regulatory action on the part of the FDA (or foreign counterparts) or
declining sales;
<PAGE>
The impact of business combinations, including acquisitions and
divestitures, both internally for the Company and externally in the
pharmaceutical and health care industries; and
Issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board or the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could
impact upon the Company's ability to achieve results described in any
forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible
to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be
a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The Company has
identified the factors on this list as permitted by the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

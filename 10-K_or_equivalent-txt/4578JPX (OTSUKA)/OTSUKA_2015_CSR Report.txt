The Otsuka Group CSR vision draws inspiration from the forward and backward flows of the
famous eddies in the Naruto Straits, near the city in Tokushima, Japan where Otsuka was found-
ed. In a way analogous to these two-way currents, the Otsuka Group contributes profits back to
society in one direction, while in the other direction it pursues commercial activities rooted in its
corporate philosophy that reinforce social goodwill.

To Become
an Indispensable Contributor to
People’s Health Worldwide
Dedicated to a Management Philosophy that
Anticipates and Fulfills Customer Needs
While remaining deeply committed to pharmaceuticals and nu-
traceuticals (NC)* as our two core areas, the Otsuka Group has
expanded into businesses that include clinical nutrition, med-
ical equipment, and chemicals. As our business has developed,
Otsuka has grown to operate around the world with 49 companies
in Japan and 129 companies in other countries, which employ ap-
proximately 47,000 people.
Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth. To do this, we seek to
gain a deeper understanding of what patients and consumers are
seeking—in other words, the underlying fundamental needs that
drive their wants—as we work to develop competitive products
and services.
The Otsuka Group is currently working under its Second
Medium-Term Management Plan, which will conclude in December
2018. We are concentrating on reorganizing business segments
and strengthening management practices with the goal to become
an indispensable contributor to people’s health worldwide.
The management plan is designed to ensure sustainable growth
for the Otsuka Group beyond 2018 by diversifying the Group’s
profit structure over the plan’s five-year period, maintaining a basic
policy of continued investment, and moving forward structural
reforms so that our business will expand steadily. In the pharma-
ceutical business, we aim to maximize product value in two core
areas, the central nervous system and oncology, as well as to make
steady progress in specific R&D fields that address unmet medical
needs. In the nutraceutical business, the management plan calls
for accelerated development of new products and their accelerated
global deployment, alongside a corresponding reassessment and
restructuring of management resources to facilitate growth.

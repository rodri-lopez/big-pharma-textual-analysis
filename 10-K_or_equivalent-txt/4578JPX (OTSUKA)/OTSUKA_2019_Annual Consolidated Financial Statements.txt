-9-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Reporting Entity
Otsuka Holdings Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) is a company incorporated in
Japan. The addresses of its registered head office and principal business offices are disclosed on the
Company’s website (URL https://www.otsuka.com/en/). The consolidated financial statements of the
Company, which were prepared with the end of the fiscal year on December 31, 2019, comprise the Company
and its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as the “Group”) and interests in its associates.
The details of businesses and principal business activities of the Group are provided in Note “5. Operating
Segments.”
2. Basis of Preparation
(1) Compliance with IFRS
Pursuant to the provision of Article 93 of the Ordinance on Consolidated Financial Statements, the
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in compliance with IFRS since the
Company qualifies as a “Specified Company under Designated International Accounting Standards”
prescribed in Article 1-2 of the Ordinance.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 were
approved on March 26, 2020 by Tatsuo Higuchi, President and Representative Director, CEO, and Yuko
Makino, Executive Director, CFO.
(2) Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for financial
instruments, etc. measured at fair value.
(3) Functional currency and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Japanese yen, which is the Company’s functional
currency, and figures are rounded down to the nearest million yen.
(4) Changes in accounting policies
The Group has adopted the following standards from the current fiscal year.
IFRS Description of newly issued standards, interpretations and amendments
IFRS 16 Leases Amendment concerning accounting treatment for leases
From the current fiscal year, the Group has adopted IFRS 16 “Leases” (issued in January 2016, hereinafter
referred to as “IFRS 16”).
On adoption of IFRS 16, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were recognized at the date of initial
application of IFRS 16 (January 1, 2019) for leases previously classified as operating leases applying IAS
17 “Leases” (hereinafter referred to as “IAS 17”). In addition, operating lease payments that were expensed
as incurred applying IAS 17 are recorded as depreciation for right-of-use assets and interest costs for lease
liabilities in the consolidated statement of income for the current fiscal year, and are reclassified from a
reduction in cash flows from operating activities to a reduction in cash flows from financing activities in
the consolidated statement of cash flows.
The details of the accounting policy for leases are provided in Note “3. Significant Accounting Policies
(10) Leases.”
In accordance with the transition requirement under IFRS 16, the Group has retrospectively adopted IFRS
16 and recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 as an adjustment to the opening
balance of retained earnings for the current fiscal year. In transitioning to IFRS 16, the Group chooses the
practical expedient detailed in IFRS 16 paragraph C3 about whether a contract is, or contains a lease and
continuously utilizes a result of assessment applying IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 “Determining whether an
Arrangement contains a Lease.”
Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commence
date discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application. The
-10-weighted average lessee’s incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities recognized in the
consolidated statement of financial position at the date of initial application is 3.9%. Right-of-use assets are
initially measured at the initial measurement of the lease liabilities adjusted by the amount of any prepaid
or accrued lease payments.
As a result, compared with the application of the previous accounting standard, as of the beginning of the
current fiscal year, right-of-use assets increased by ¥59,324 million as property, plant and equipment in the
consolidated statement of financial position, and retained earnings decreased by ¥23 million. The following
is the reconciliation of operating lease contracts disclosed applying IAS 17 at the end of the previous fiscal
year and lease liabilities recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position at the date of initial
application.
(Millions of yen)
Amount
Operating lease contracts disclosed as of December 31, 2018 42,631
Operating lease contracts discounted using the incremental borrowing rate as of January 1,
33,366
2019
Finance lease contracts disclosed as of December 31, 2018 8,054
Lease contracts accounted for as short-term lease expenses (213)
Cancellable operating lease contracts 28,339
Others 118
Lease liabilities as of January 1, 2019 69,665
In the application of IFRS 16, the Group applies the following practical expedients detailed in IFRS 16
paragraph C10.
 A single discount rate is applied to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics.
 Leases for which the lease term ends within 12 months of the date of initial application are accounted
for in the same way as short-term leases.
 Initial direct costs are excluded from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial
application.
 Hindsight is used, such as in determining the lease term for the contract containing options to extend or
terminate the lease.
(5) Changes in presentation
(Consolidated Statements of Financial Position)
The Group has adopted IFRS16 from the current fiscal year. In line with this application, “Lease
liabilities,” which was included in “Other financial liabilities” in the previous fiscal year, is separately
presented from the current fiscal year due to the increased materiality of the amount. To reflect this change
in presentation, the consolidated financial statements for the previous fiscal year have been reclassified
accordingly.
As a result, ¥1,894 million previously presented as “Other financial liabilities” under “Current liabilities”
and ¥6,159 million previously presented as “Other financial liabilities” under “Non-current liabilities” have
been reclassified into “Lease liabilities” under “Current liabilities” and “Lease liabilities” under “Non-
current liabilities,” respectively.
(Consolidated Statements of Income)
For the purpose of providing more useful and clearer information on future cash flow projection and others,
it has been decided that impairment losses on in-process research and development which were included in
“Research and development expenses” and other impairment losses which were included in “Selling,
general and administrative expenses” in the previous fiscal year are separately presented, in aggregate, as
“Impairment losses” from the current fiscal year. To reflect this change in presentation, the consolidated
financial statements for the previous fiscal year have been reclassified accordingly.
As a result, ¥23,208 million previously included in “Research and development expenses” and ¥11,533
million previously included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” have been reclassified into
¥34,742 million of “Impairment losses.”
-11-(Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows)
The Group has adopted IFRS16 from the current fiscal year. In line with the application, “Repayments of
lease liabilities,” which was included in “Other” under “Cash flows from financing activities” in the
previous fiscal year, is separately presented from the current fiscal year due to the increased materiality of
the amount. To reflect this change in presentation, the consolidated financial statements for the previous
fiscal year have been reclassified accordingly.
As a result, ¥(2,202) million previously presented as “Other” under “Cash flows from financing activities”
has been reclassified into “Repayments of lease liabilities” under “Cash flows from financing activities.”
(6) New standards not yet adopted
Among the standards and interpretations newly issued or amended by the date of approval that is described
in the Note “2. Basis of Preparation,” there were no new or amended standards and interpretations that
have been early adopted by the Group as of December 31, 2019. The impact of the adoption of these
standards and interpretations has not been provided because it is expected to be insignificant.
3. Significant Accounting Policies
(1) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when the Group
has power over the investee, is exposed or has rights to variable returns arising from the Group’s
involvement in the investee and has an ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the
date that the Group gains control until the date that control is lost.
If any accounting policies applied by a subsidiary differ from those applied by the Group, adjustments
are made to the subsidiary’s financial statements where needed. The balances of payables and receivables
and internal transactions within the group companies as well as unrealized gains or losses arising from
internal transactions are offset in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
When the ownership interest in a subsidiary is partially disposed of, the transaction is accounted for as an
equity transaction if the Group retains control over the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of
adjustment to the non-controlling interests and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is
recognized directly in equity attributable to owners of the Company.
If the Group loses control over the subsidiary, gains or losses derived from such loss are recognized as
profit or loss.
(ii) Associates
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence in terms of financial and operating
policies but which the Group does not control or jointly control. The Group is presumed to have
significant influence over another entity when it holds at least 20% but 50% or less of the voting rights of
the entity.
Investments in associates are recognized at cost at the time of acquisition and subsequently accounted for
using the equity method. Goodwill recognized on acquisition is included in investments in associates.
Because such goodwill is not separately recognized, it is not tested for impairment separately. Instead,
the entire amount of the investments in associates is tested for impairment as a single asset whenever
objective evidence indicates that the investments in associates may be impaired.
If any accounting policies applied by an associate differ from those applied by the Group, adjustments
are made to the associate’s financial statements where needed. When the Group has retained interests
after losing significant influence, these interests are measured at fair value and any difference between
the fair value and the carrying amount of the investment as of the date on which the equity method was
discontinued is recognized as profit or loss.
(2) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of non-
controlling interests in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held
equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed. In case the identifiable net asset exceeds the aggregate of the
consideration and others, such excess is immediately recognized in profit or loss.
-12-The consideration transferred is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets
transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the
equity interests issued by the acquirer. The consideration transferred includes any assets or liabilities
resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. The amount of non-controlling interests in the
acquiree is measured for each business combination either at fair value or as the present ownership
instruments’ proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date are measured at their fair values
as of the acquisition date, except for limited exceptions based on the requirements of IFRS 3 “Business
Combinations.”
Transaction costs incurred in relation to business combinations are recognized as expenses when they are
incurred.
If the initial accounting for business combinations is incomplete by the end of the fiscal year in which the
business combinations occur, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting
is incomplete. Those provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date are retrospectively adjusted to
reflect new information obtained during the measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed
as of the acquisition date and, if known at the acquisition date, would have affected the measurement of the
amounts recognized. Additional assets or liabilities are recognized if new information is known to have
resulted in the additional recognition of assets or liabilities. The measurement period does not exceed one
year.
(3) Foreign currency translation
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated to the respective functional currencies of the group
companies at exchange rates on the transaction dates or exchange rates which are close to the actual rate
on the transaction dates. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated to the functional
currency at the closing rate. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
value are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of measurement.
Translation differences arising from translations or settlements are recognized as profit or loss; provided,
however, that translation differences arising from financial assets measured through other comprehensive
income as well as from cash flow hedges are recognized as other comprehensive income.
(ii) Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Japanese yen at the closing rate. The
revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Japanese yen at the average exchange rate
for the reporting period. Translation differences arising from translation of financial statements of foreign
operations are recognized as other comprehensive income. The foreign currency translation reserve is
recognized in profit or loss for periods in which foreign operations are disposed.
(4) Financial instruments
(i) Financial assets
i) Initial recognition and measurement
Trade and other receivables are initially recognized on the date when they are incurred. All other
financial assets are initially recognized on the contract date when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the financial instruments.
At the initial recognition, all financial assets, except for those measured at fair value through profit or
loss, are measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Transaction costs of
financial assets measured through profit or loss are recognized in profit or loss.
At the initial recognition, financial assets are classified as (a) Financial assets measured at amortized
cost, (b) Debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, (c) Equity
instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or (d) Financial assets
measured at fair value through profit or loss.
(a) Financial assets measured at amortized cost
Financial assets are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost if both of the
following conditions are met.
 The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial
assets in order to collect contractual cash flows.
 The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that
are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
-13-(b) Debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Financial assets are classified as debt instruments measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met.
 The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both
collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
 The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that
are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
(c) Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
For investments in some equity instruments, the Group has chosen an irrevocable option to
present subsequent changes in fair value of investments that are neither ‘held for trading’ nor
‘contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination to which IFRS
3 Business Combinations applies,’ in other comprehensive income. The Group classifies such
investments as equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
(d) Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets, except for financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt instruments
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and equity instruments measured
at fair value through other comprehensive income stated above, are classified as financial
assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.
ii) Subsequent measurement
After their initial recognition, financial assets are measured according to their classification as
follows:
(a) Financial assets measured at amortized cost
Financial assets measured at amortized cost are measured at amortized cost using the effective
interest method. Amortization using the effective interest method and gains or losses arising in
the case of derecognition are recognized in profit or loss.
(b) Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured
at fair value. Any changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income. When
such financial assets are derecognized, the accumulated other comprehensive income is
transferred to retained earnings. Meanwhile, dividends from such financial assets are
recognized as profit or loss.
(c) Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and
any changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss.
iii) Impairment
With respect to impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost, the Group recognizes an
allowance for expected credit losses on such financial assets.
At the end of each fiscal year, the Group evaluates whether the credit risk on financial instruments has
increased significantly since the initial recognition.
If credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since the initial recognition, the
allowance for that instrument is measured at an amount equal to the 12-month expected credit losses.
If credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since the initial recognition, the
allowance for such financial instrument is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit
losses.
The Group considers that, as a rule-of-thumb, there has been a significant increase in credit risk when
no payments have been made and more than 30 days have passed since the contractual due date. The
assessment of whether or not credit risk has increased significantly takes into account all relevant
current information that is reasonably available to the Group, as well as historic information.
When the credit risk on a financial asset is considered to be low at the end of a fiscal year, the Group
determines that the credit risk on that financial asset has not increased significantly since its initial
recognition.
However, with regards to trade receivables, etc., that do not contain a significant financing
component, the allowance is always measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit
losses, regardless of whether or not there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial
recognition.
Expected credit losses of a financial instrument are measured using a methodology which reflects the
following:
 An unbiased and probability-weighted loss that is determined by evaluating a range of possible
outcomes;
 The time value of money; and
-14- Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the
reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.
The changes in these measurements are recognized in profit or loss. The amount of expected credit
losses (or reversal) required to adjust the loss allowance at the end of the fiscal year to the amount
that is required to be recognized is recognized as impairment gains or impairment losses.
iv) Derecognition
The Group derecognizes financial assets only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
financial assets expire, or when the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of the financial assets.
(ii) Financial liabilities
i) Initial recognition and measurement
Bonds and borrowings are initially recognized on the date when they are issued or incurred. All other
financial liabilities are initially recognized on the contract date when the Group becomes a party to
the contractual provisions of the financial instruments.
At the initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as (a) financial liabilities measured at
amortized cost and (b) financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss.
At the initial recognition, financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are measured at fair value
net of transaction costs that are directly attributable to the financial liability. Transaction costs of
financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in profit or loss.
ii) Subsequent measurement
After their initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured according to their classification as
follows:
(a) Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method. Amortization using the effective interest method and gains or losses
arising in the case of derecognition are recognized in profit or loss.
(b) Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and
any changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss.
iii) Derecognition
The Group derecognizes the financial liability when a financial liability is extinguished, that is, the
obligations specified in a contract are discharged, cancelled or expired.
(iii) Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented only when the Group
currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amount and intends either to settle on a
net basis or realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
(iv) Derivatives and hedge accounting
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value. After their initial recognition, derivatives continue to be
measured at fair value.
The Group utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swap agreements, currency option
transactions, interest rate swap agreements and other derivatives to hedge foreign currency risk and
interest rate risk.
At inception of a hedging relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedging
relationship and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The
documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk
being hedged, and the methods of assessing whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge
effectiveness requirements. The Group assesses whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge
effectiveness requirements, both at inception and on an ongoing basis. Ongoing assessments are
performed at each reporting date or upon a significant change in the circumstances affecting the hedge
effectiveness requirements, whichever comes first.
The Group applies hedge accounting to cash flow hedges which meet the criteria for hedge accounting
and such hedges are accounted for as follows:
The portions of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that are determined to be effective hedges are
recognized in other comprehensive income, while the remaining ineffective portions are recognized in
profit or loss. The amounts associated with the hedging instruments recognized in other comprehensive
-15-income are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged transactions affect profit or loss. However, in
cases where the hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial
asset or liability, the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is accounted for as an
adjustment to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
When the hedging relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria, or the hedging instrument expires or
is sold, terminated or exercised, the application of hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. When
forecast transactions or firm commitments are no longer expected to occur, any related cumulative gains
or losses that have been recognized in equity through other comprehensive income are reclassified to
profit or loss.
The Group does not undertake any fair value hedges or any hedges of net investment in foreign
operations.
(5) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term investments with
repayment terms of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible to cash and
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
(6) Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated
costs necessary to make the sale. The cost of inventories is determined mainly by using the weighted-
average cost formula. The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other
costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition.
(7) Property, plant and equipment
The cost model is applied in measurement of property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment
are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The cost of property, plant and equipment includes cost directly incidental to the acquisition of assets, the
initial estimated costs of dismantling and removing the assets and restoration costs.
Depreciation expense for assets except for land and construction in progress is recognized mainly by the
straight-line method over the respective estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of major asset
items are as follows:
 Buildings and structures: 2 to 65 years
 Machinery and vehicles: 2 to 58 years
 Tools, furniture and fixtures: 2 to 20 years
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods of assets are reviewed at the end of
each fiscal year, and any changes are applied prospectively as a change in an accounting estimate.
(8) Goodwill
Measurement of goodwill at the initial recognition is provided in “(2) Business combinations.” After the
initial recognition, the amount is recorded at its cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to each of the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units (hereinafter
referred to as the “Cash-Generating Units”) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business
combination. Cash-Generating Units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment
annually and whenever there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of
Cash-Generating Units is less than their carrying amounts, an impairment loss is recognized in profit or
loss. With regard to allocation of impairment losses recognized in association with Cash-Generating Units,
first the carrying amount of goodwill that has been allocated to the unit is reduced, and then the remaining
amount of impairment loss is allocated to other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying
amount of each asset in the unit. For impairment losses recognized on goodwill, no reversal is made in
subsequent periods.
(9) Intangible assets
The cost model is applied in measurement of intangible assets. Intangible assets are carried at cost less any
accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.
Separately acquired intangible assets are measured at cost at the time of the initial recognition.
Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
Internally generated intangible assets, other than development expenses that meet the requirements for
capitalization, are recognized as an expense when incurred.
-16-Amortization expense on each intangible asset with a finite useful life is recognized by the straight-line
method over its estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives of major intangible assets are as follows:
 Patents: 5 to 15 years
 Trademarks, distribution rights and others: 3 to 16 years
 Software: 2 to 10 years
The estimated useful lives, residual values and amortization methods are reviewed at the end of each fiscal
year, and any changes are applied prospectively as a change in an accounting estimate.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives consist mainly of brands and trademarks acquired separately or
in business combinations, and are included in intangible assets as trademarks, distribution rights and others.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed at the end of each fiscal year to determine
whether the indefinite useful life assessment remains appropriate. If it is no longer appropriate, the change
in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate.
In-process research and development acquired separately or in business combinations are included in
intangible assets as in-process research and development. Because these assets are intangible assets that are
not yet available for use, they are not amortized and are tested for impairment. An asset in “in-process
research and development” is transferred to trademarks, distribution rights and others when the asset
becomes available for use by obtaining permits and approvals from regulatory authorities in a subsequent
period, and begins to be amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life from that time.
(10) Leases
FY2018 (From January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018)
Lease transactions in which substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are transferred to
the Group are classified as finance leases. All other lease transactions are classified as operating leases.
With regards to finance leases, the Group initially recognizes lease assets and liabilities at the fair value of
the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the
inception of the lease.
Leased assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives
or lease terms. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance costs and the repayments of the lease
obligations. Finance costs are allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant
periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Lease payments under operating leases are recognized as expenses using the straight-line method over the
lease term.
FY2019 (From January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019)
For the leases that the Group has contracted as a lessee, right-of-use assets are measured at cost, and lease
liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful
lives or lease terms.
Lease payments are recognized upon apportionment between the finance costs and the repayments of lease
liabilities based on the interest method.
The Group does not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases on intangible assets and
short-term leases within 12 months. The Group recognizes the lease payments relating to short-term leases
on either a straight-line basis over the lease term or another systematic basis.
(11) Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
The Group assesses whether there is any indication of impairment at the end of each fiscal year for
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount
of the asset is estimated. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset,
the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. A cash-
generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. For the intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives, or those not yet available for use, the recoverable amounts are estimated at the end
of each fiscal year, regardless of whether there is any indication of impairment.
The recoverable amount of an individual asset or a cash-generating unit is measured at the higher of its fair
value less cost of disposal or its value in use. The value in use is calculated by discounting the estimated
future cash flows to the present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the time value of money
and the risks specific to the asset.
-17-The corporate assets do not independently generate cash inflows. When there is an indication of
impairment of the corporate assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the
corporate assets belong is calculated.
Impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss when the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating
unit exceeds the recoverable amount.
For an impairment loss recognized in prior periods, the Group assesses whether there is any indication of a
decrease or disappearance of the impairment loss at the end of each fiscal year. If there is any indication of
reversal of impairment loss, the recoverable amounts of assets or cash-generating units are estimated. In
cases in which the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit,
the impairment loss is reversed up to the lower of the recoverable amount or the carrying amount less any
depreciation and amortization costs that would have been determined had no impairment loss been
recognized.
(12) Assets held for sale
Assets or groups of assets expected to be recovered not by continuous use but by sale are classified as non-
current assets or disposal groups held for sale when they are quite likely to be sold within one year, they are
available for immediate sale in its present condition, and management of the Group is committed to such
sale. In such case, non-current assets are neither depreciated nor amortized, and are measured at carrying
amount or fair value less cost of sales, whichever is lower.
(13) Post-employment benefits
The Group’s post-employment benefit plans for its employees include defined benefit plans and defined
contribution plans.
The Group uses the projected unit credit method to determine the present value of the defined benefit
obligations, the related current service cost and the past service cost.
The discount rate is determined based on market yields on high quality corporate bonds at the end of the
fiscal year that are consistent with the discount period, which is set for the projected period until the
expected date of benefit payment in each fiscal year.
Net defined benefit liabilities or assets are calculated by deducting the fair value of the plan assets from the
present value of the defined benefit obligations. If the defined benefit plan has surplus, the defined benefit
asset is limited to the asset ceiling that is the present value of any future economic benefits available in the
form of reductions in the future contributions to the plan or cash refunds.
Service costs and net interest on the net defined benefit liabilities (assets) are recognized in profit or loss.
The remeasured amount of a defined benefit plan is recognized at once in other comprehensive income
when it occurs, and immediately transferred to retained earnings.
Contributions to the defined contribution retirement benefits are recognized as expenses when employees
have rendered service.
(14) Provisions
Provisions are recognized when there are present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events,
it is probable that outflows of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligations, and reliable estimates can be made of the amount of obligations.
The amount recognized as provisions is the best estimate taking into account the risks and uncertainties of
the expenditure required to settle the present obligations on the reporting date. When the time value of
money is material, the amount of provision is measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to
be required to settle the obligation.
(15) Treasury shares
Treasury shares are measured at acquisition cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognized
associated with the purchase, sale or retirement of treasury shares of the Company. Any difference between
the carrying amount and the consideration received from the sale is recognized as capital surplus.
(16) Share-based payments
(i) Equity-settled share-based payment plan
The Group has adopted a restricted stock compensation plan accounted for as an equity-settled share-
based payment plan from the current fiscal year. The stock option plan has been terminated due to the
elapse of the applicable service period for the plan, and all stock options were exercised for the current
fiscal year.
-18-Restricted stock compensation is measured at fair value at the grant date and recognized as expenses over
the vesting periods from the grant date with the corresponding amounts as increases in equity. The fair
value of restricted stock compensation is measured by reference to fair value of granted shares of the
Company.
(ii) Cash-settled share-based payment plan
The Group has adopted equity-linked compensation entitlements as a cash-settled share-based payment
plan.
For the cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of payments is recognized as a liability, and any
changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as profit or loss until the liability is settled.
(17) Revenue
(i) Sales of products
For sales of products, the performance obligation is judged to have been satisfied and revenue is
therefore recognized upon delivery of the products because legal title, physical possession, significant
risks and rewards of ownership of the products are transferred to customer upon delivery, and the
customer obtains control over the products.
Products may be sold with a rebate based upon the achievement of a defined sales volume and amount.
In such a case, the transaction price is recognized as the consideration promised in the contract, less
estimated rebates and other items. Rebates are measured by the ‘most likely amount’ method based on
historical performance. Revenue is recognized only to the extent that it is highly probable that significant
reversal will not occur.
The consideration of sales is received primarily within one year from the time of delivery, and it does not
include significant financing component.
(ii) License and royalty income
License income is up-front and milestone payments that the Group receives based on license agreements,
etc., which the Group and a third party enter into for development and distribution right of developing
and finished products. Under license agreements, etc., if contractual obligations are fulfilled at a specific
point in time, up-front payments are recognized as revenue once development and distribution rights are
granted. If contractual obligations are fulfilled over a period of time, such payments are recorded as
contract liabilities and recognized as revenue over a period (estimated contract term, etc.) in accordance
with the method of measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations, such as
those related to development cooperation, determined by each contract. Income from milestone payments
received under license agreements is recognized as revenue from the point when the conditions are met
to avoid future reversal of revenues.
Royalty income is the income from license agreements, etc., calculated based on the sales, etc., of
counterparties and its revenue is recognized at the later point of either the counterparty’s revenue
recognition, etc., or satisfaction of performance obligations.
License and royalty income is received primarily within one year from the time when the right to the
amount is earned based on the contract, and it does not include material financing component.
(18) Government grants
Grant income is measured at fair value and recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the Group
will comply with the conditions attached to the grants and that the grants will be received. Grants for
revenue incurred are recorded as revenue in the fiscal year during which the expenses occurred. Grants for
the assets are recorded as revenue regularly over the useful life of the asset, and unearned grant income is
recorded as liability.
(19) Finance income and finance costs
Finance income principally consists of interest income, dividend income, gain on fair value valuation and
foreign exchange gains. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method when the income
arises. Dividend income is recognized when the Group’s right to receive the dividend is established.
Finance costs principally consist of interest expenses, loss on fair value valuation and foreign exchange
losses.
-19-(20) Income taxes
Income taxes consist of current taxes and deferred taxes. These taxes are recognized in profit or loss,
except for those related to business combinations and items recognized directly in equity or other
comprehensive income.
Current taxes are measured at the amount of expected tax payment to or expected tax refund from tax
authorities. The amount of taxes is computed in accordance with tax rates and tax laws that are in effect or
substantially in effect by the end of the fiscal year in countries where the Group conducts business
activities and earns taxable profits or losses.
Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between accounting carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities at the reporting date and amounts of them for tax purposes, unused tax losses and unused tax
credits.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recorded for the following temporary differences:
 Temporary differences arising from goodwill
 Temporary differences arising from initial recognition of assets and liabilities which occur through
transactions that affect neither accounting profit nor taxable profit for tax purposes, except for business
combinations
 In cases where, for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and
associates, timing of reversal can be controlled and it is highly probable that such temporary differences
are not reversed in a foreseeable period
 In cases where, for deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and
associates, it is highly probable that such temporary differences are not reversed to the extent
foreseeable
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized, in principle, for all taxable temporary differences, while deferred tax
assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is highly probable that
taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences could be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed in every period, and reduced by the amount of
deferred tax assets for which taxable profit sufficient to use all or part of the deferred tax assets is unlikely
to be earned. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed in every period and recognized to the extent
that it is highly probable that deferred tax assets are realizable with future taxable profit.
The Company and certain domestic subsidiaries have adopted the consolidated taxation system from the
current fiscal year.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in accordance with tax rates and tax laws expected to be
applied in the period in which the assets are realized or the liabilities are settled based on tax rates and tax
laws that are in effect or substantially in effect at the end of the fiscal year.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
assets against current tax liabilities, and they are related to income taxes levied by the same taxation
authority on the same taxable entity.
(21) Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity
holders of the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares issued during the period that
is adjusted by the number of treasury shares. Diluted earnings per share are calculated reflecting the
adjustment of the impact from all diluted shares with dilutive effect.
4. Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgments
In preparing IFRS-compliant consolidated financial statements, the management is required to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Such estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The effects of the review of
accounting estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the review was conducted and future
accounting periods.
Of items for which the management made estimates and judgments, those that have significant effects on the
amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements are as follows:
 Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (items (7) and (9) of Note “3.
Significant Accounting Policies,” Notes “12. Property, Plant and Equipment” and “13. Goodwill and
Intangible Assets”)
 Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets (items (8) and (11) of Note “3.
Significant Accounting Policies” and Note “14. Impairment of Assets”)
 Fair value measurement of the financial instruments (Note “33. Financial Instruments”)
 Recoverability of deferred tax assets (Note “16. Income Taxes”)
-20- Accounting and measurement of provisions (Note “22. Provisions”)
 Measurements of defined benefit obligations (Note “23. Post-employment Benefits”)
 Revenue recognition (item (17) of Note “3. Significant Accounting Policies” and Note “25. Revenue”)
 Contingent liabilities (Note “40. Contingent Liabilities”)
5. Operating Segments
(1) Overview of reportable segments
The Group’s reportable segments are the constituent units of the Group for which separate financial
information is available and which are subject to periodic reviews by the Board of Directors in order to
make decisions on allocation of business resources and to evaluate the business performances of the
respective segments.
As the Group’s holding company, the Company directs the Group’s strategic planning, monitors Group
operations and provides various services to its group companies. Business activities are conducted by the
Group’s subsidiaries and associates.
Centering on healthcare business, the Group operates activities inside and outside Japan relating to the
following four reportable segments: “Pharmaceuticals,” “Nutraceuticals,” “Consumer products” and
“Others” businesses. The Group defines the reportable segments as follows:
“Pharmaceuticals” comprises manufacturing and sales of prescription drugs, intravenous solutions, and
others. “Nutraceuticals” comprises manufacturing and sales of functional beverages, etc., over-the-counter
drugs and nutritional supplements. “Consumer products” comprises manufacturing and sales of mineral
water, soft beverages and food products. “Others” encompasses logistics, warehousing, manufacturing and
sales of chemical products, evaluation systems for LED displays and spectroanalysis devices.
(2) Revenue and performances by reportable segment
Revenue and performances by the Group’s reportable segment are as follows.
Segment profit is based on operating profit.
Intersegment revenue and transfers reflect reasonable prices for intersegment transfers based on market
value.

The impairment loss on property, plant and equipment of ¥850 million is principally a reduction of the
carrying amount of machinery and vehicles and tools, furniture and fixtures to the recoverable amount,
which is value in use, due to a decrease in the profitability.
The impairment loss on intangible assets of ¥33,034 million is principally ¥8,727 million of impairment
loss on trademarks, distribution rights and others for ONZETRA Xsail, ¥8,640 million of impairment loss
on in-process research and development for centanafadine (development code: EB-1020) which is being
developed for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and ¥12,942 million of
impairment loss on in-process research and development for guadecitabine (development code: SGI-110)
which is being developed for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.
The impairment loss for ONZETRA Xsail is a reduction of the full carrying amount due to termination of
the license agreement.
The impairment loss for centanafadine (development code: EB-1020) is a reduction of the carrying amount
to the recoverable amount of ¥10,389 million, which is value in use, because the initially assumed
profitability was no longer expected. For calculation of the value in use, the discount rate (13.5%) based on
the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital was used.
The impairment loss for guadecitabine (development code: SGI-110) is a reduction of the carrying amount
to the recoverable amount of ¥11,066 million, which is value in use, because the initially assumed
profitability was no longer expected. For calculation of the value in use, the discount rate (11.2% to 11.8%)
based on the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital was used.
An impairment loss and a reversal of impairment loss in the pharmaceutical business recognized in
FY2019 are ¥8,754 million and ¥3,263 million respectively, and an impairment loss of ¥8,754 million
consists of impairment losses on property, plant and equipment of ¥4,728 million, on goodwill of ¥306
million, and on intangible assets of ¥3,719 million.
The impairment losses on property, plant and equipment of ¥4,728 million are principally a reduction of the
carrying amount of buildings and structures, machinery and vehicles, and tools, furniture and fixtures to the
recoverable amount, which is value in use, due to a decrease in the profitability.
The impairment losses on intangible assets of ¥3,719 million are principally a reduction of the carrying
amount of in-process research and development, and trademarks, distribution rights and others to the
recoverable amount, which is value in use, due to a decrease in the profitability.
-33-(2) Impairment test of goodwill
Goodwill arising in business combinations is allocated to cash-generating units that benefit from the
business combination on the acquisition date. The breakdown of the carrying amount of goodwill by
segment is as follows.
(Millions of yen)
FY2018 FY2019
(As of December 31, 2018) (As of December 31, 2019)
Pharmaceuticals 231,501 226,550
Nutraceuticals 43,739 42,468
Consumer products 473 467
Others 5,274 5,274
Total 280,989 274,761
Of the above, the carrying amount of significant goodwill in FY2019 is Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(pharmaceuticals) of ¥149,131 million (FY2018: ¥151,091 million), Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(pharmaceuticals) of ¥30,365 million (FY2018: ¥31,307 million), Visterra, Inc. (pharmaceuticals) of
¥25,054 million (FY2018: ¥26,715 million), and Nutrition & Santé SAS (nutraceuticals) of ¥23,680
million (FY2018: ¥25,216 million).
The Group tests goodwill for impairment in each fiscal period, or whenever there is an indication of
impairment. The recoverable amount in impairment test is determined based on value in use.
Value in use reflects past experience and external information, and is calculated by discounting the
estimated amount of cash flows based on the business plan for the next five years approved by the
management and the growth rate to the present value using the discount rate (8.4% to 11.0%) based on the
pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of the cash-generating unit. The growth rate is determined to be
0% to 1.2% in view of the long-term average growth rate in the industry or country to which the cash-
generating unit belongs, and does not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the market.
There is the risk that impairment may arise when key assumptions used in the impairment test are changed.
However, the value in use adequately exceeds the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit, and it is
considered unlikely that the value in use falls below the carrying amount even if key assumptions used in
the impairment test change within a reasonably predictable range.
(3) Impairment test of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives included in trademark rights in FY2019 are principally brands
held by the Nutrition & Santé SAS Group (nutraceuticals), and their carrying amount is ¥20,273 million
(FY2018: ¥22,526 million).
Each brand is tested for impairment in each fiscal period, or whenever there is an indication of impairment,
using the relief-from-royalty method and the excess earnings method. Value in use reflects past experience
and external information, and is determined using the business plan for the next five years approved by the
management and the discount rate (6.5% to 14.0%) equal to pre-tax weighted average cost of capital to
which certain country risk and foreign currency risk are added where necessary. The growth rate is
determined to be 0% to 1.5% in view of the long-term average growth rate in the industry or country to
which the cash-generating unit belongs, and does not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the
market. The value in use adequately exceeds the carrying amount in each case, and it is considered unlikely
that the value in use falls below the carrying amount even if key assumptions used in the impairment test
change within a reasonably predictable range.
-34-(4) Impairment test of in-process research and development
In-process research and development in FY2019 is principally rights related to research and development
of AVP-786, and their carrying amount is ¥156,451 million (FY2018: ¥158,508 million).
As intangible assets not yet available for use, in-process research and development is tested for impairment
in each fiscal period, or whenever there is an indication of impairment. The recoverable amount in
impairment test is determined based on value in use.
Value in use reflects past experience and external information, and is calculated by discounting the
estimated amount of cash flows based on the business plan for the next five years approved by the
management and the growth rate to the present value using the discount rate based on the pre-tax weighted
average cost of capital of the cash-generating unit (12.4% for AVP-786).

In recognizing deferred tax assets, the Group takes into account the possibility that part or all of deductible
temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be used against future taxable profit. In
assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, reversal of deferred tax liabilities, expected future
taxable profit and tax planning are taken into account. Based on the level of taxable profit in the past and
estimated future taxable profit in the period during which deferred tax assets are deductible, the Group
considers it is probable that deferred taxable assets recognized as of December 31, 2019 will be recovered.
-36-(2) Unrecognized deferred tax assets
Deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits for which no deferred tax asset
is recognized are as follows.

Deferred tax assets on the above items are not recognized because it is not highly probable that future
taxable income necessary for the Group to utilize the benefits arises. Deductible temporary differences do
not expire under current tax law. Expiration of unused tax losses of the Company and some of its
subsidiaries is as follows.

and others for which the Group has obligations to restore the site to its original condition at the end of the lease
contract.
The Group expects that the timing at which economic resources flow out is principally after one year passed
from the end of each fiscal year.
23. Post-employment Benefits
The Group has adopted defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans as post-employment benefit
plans.
Major domestic subsidiaries have a contributory funded, defined benefit corporate pension plan and lump–
sum retirement payments plan as defined benefit plans, and defined contribution pension plans as defined
contribution plans.
Certain foreign subsidiaries have contributory funded or unfunded defined benefit plans, defined contribution
plans, or a combination of them.
Among defined benefit plans, the major plan is the defined benefit plan in Japan, which accounts for
approximately 90% of total defined benefit obligations. In the current fiscal year, some domestic subsidiaries
have abolished early retirement plans.
There is no post-employment benefit other than pensions and lump-sum payments.
For the accounting policy for defined benefit plans, please refer to Note “3. Significant Accounting Policies
(13) Post-employment benefits.”
(1) Defined benefit plans
For benefits under defined benefit plans of the Company and major domestic subsidiaries, the amount of
retirement benefit payments is calculated based on service years, salaries during the service period, position
and other factors. When the period of validity of a retiring employee equals to or more than a certain
period, benefits are paid as lump-sum payment or pension at the option of the employee. Upon retirement,
etc. of employees, additional retirement benefits that do not qualify as benefits under defined benefit plans
may be paid.
Defined benefit corporate pension plans are managed by Otsuka Pharmaceuticals corporate pension fund.
Directors of this pension fund and the pension plan management institution are required by laws and
regulations to behave in a way that gives utmost priority to the interest of plan participants and former
participants and assume the responsibility for managing plan assets under the prescribed policy.
Although defined benefit retirement benefit plans are exposed to general investment risk, interest rate risk
and others, it is considered that the exposure to these risks is not significant.

Management policy for plan assets
The fund management policy for major plans of the Group aims to secure stable returns over the medium to
long term to ensure the payment of defined benefit obligations now and in the future. Specifically, assets
are managed by setting the target rate of return and the asset mix by investment asset within a range of
acceptable risk defined annually and maintaining this mix.
The Group conducts review of the asset mix where necessary, taking into account financial conditions of
defined benefit pension plans and the investment environment.
When management of each asset is implemented, the Group seeks efficiency on the investment aspect
through continuous monitoring with attention to risk diversification associated to asset managers.
The fair value of the plan assets is as follows.

-57-32. Share-based Payments
The Group has introduced a restricted stock compensation plan for Directors of the Company (excluding
Outside Directors) and certain Directors of its subsidiaries from FY2019 aiming at granting incentives so as to
achieve the medium-term management plan, to sustainably improve the medium- to long-term performance
and corporate value of the Company, and to further share more of that value with shareholders. The stock
option plan, which was introduced as a medium-term incentive plan covering three-year period from the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2016 to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 has been terminated due to the
elapse of the applicable period for the plan.
In addition, the Group has adopted equity-linked compensation entitlements as a cash-settled share-based
payment plan for officers and employees of certain consolidated subsidiaries. The Group grants the
entitlements to officers and employees who have the rank as of the time of grant and makes the payment in
cash, taking into account the level of achievement of performance targets and the share price at the end of the
period for each cycle: from cycle of one-year period to cycle of three-year period.
(1) Restricted stock compensation plan
The details of restricted stock compensation plan are as follows:
FY2019
(From January 1, 2019
to December 31, 2019)

Number of shares granted 340,120 shares
Fair value at date of grant ¥4,196
Settlement method Equity-settled
Transfer restriction period From May 20, 2019 to June 1, 2026
1 Persons granted are Directors of the Company (excluding Outside Directors) and certain Directors of its subsidiaries
(hereinafter referred to as “Eligible Directors”).
2 The Company has entered into, with each Eligible Director, a restricted stock allocation agreement, which contains the
provisions that Eligible Directors shall not transfer, attach security interest, and make other dispositions of the Company’s
ordinary shares allotted (hereinafter referred to as the “Allotted Shares”), and that the Company acquires the Allotted
Shares at no cost upon the occurrence of specified events, and other provisions.
3 The Company shall remove the transfer restriction on the Allotted Shares on the condition that (1) the Eligible Director
continued to hold a position as Director of the Company (Director of its subsidiary, if the Eligible Director is a Director of
its subsidiary) during the transfer restriction period and (2) targets set by the Company in advance in light of consolidated
revenue, operating profit and other metrics were achieved. If it is determined that a person eligible for allotment retires
due to the expiration of the term of office or any other reasonable cause, the time of release from the transfer restriction
and the number of shares to be released from the transfer restriction will be reasonably adjusted as necessary.
4 The method of measuring fair value is calculated based on the closing price of shares of the Company on the First Section
of the Tokyo Stock Exchange on the business day prior to the date of a resolution of the Board of Directors.

2 851,400 shares subject to share acquisition rights granted represent the maximum number of exercisable rights, and the
number of share acquisition rights that ultimately become exercisable varies depending on the level of achievement of the
medium-term management plan and others. Therefore, 83,200 shares subject to share acquisition rights that ultimately
become exercisable were determined by multiplying the base number of share acquisition rights, which is determined for
the position of each eligible person in consideration of the content of duties performed, responsibilities, fixed
remuneration, etc., by a certain percentage according to the level of achievement of the medium-term management plan,
and all of them were exercised in FY2019.

-60-33. Financial Instruments
(1) Capital management
The Group’s basic policy for capital management is to improve capital efficiency and ensure financial
soundness in order to achieve sustainable growth and enhance corporate value over the medium to long
term.
The Group conducts monitoring of financial indicators as a procedure for capital management. The Group
monitors return on equity attributable to owners of the Company for capital efficiency and ratio of equity
attributable to owners of the Company to total assets for financial soundness in a timely manner.
The Group is not subject to any material capital restrictions.

(3) Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to financial risks (market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk) in the course of
operating activities and conducts risk management in accordance with certain policy to mitigate these
financial risks. The Group uses derivative transactions to avoid foreign currency risks or interest rate risks
and, in accordance with its policy, does not carry out any speculative transactions.
-61-(4) Market risk management
The Group’s activities are mainly exposed to risks of changes in economic circumstances and financial
market circumstances. Specifically, the risks of changes in financial market circumstances include 1)
Foreign currency risk, 2) Interest rate risk, and 3) Risk of fluctuations in equity instrument prices.
1) Foreign currency risks
(i) Foreign currency risk management
The Group engages in business globally, and fluctuations in exchange rates of the US dollar and euro,
principally, affect its operating results.
With regard to settlement of receivables and payables arising from ongoing operating activities, the
Group’s policy is to balance foreign exchange receipts and payments as much as possible with three
major currencies, namely, the US dollar, euro and yen. More specifically, operating subsidiaries that
continuously engage in export and import transactions reduce the frequency of exchanging foreign
currencies by holding foreign currencies received as export proceeds without exchanging them for the
local currency, and using them directly in payment for imports, in order to mitigate foreign currency
risks.
(ii) Foreign exchange sensitivity analysis
The Group is principally exposed to foreign currency risks of US dollar and Euro. The following table
shows the sensitivity analysis in the case where the yen’s value increases by 1% against the US dollar
and the Euro in each reporting period. In making these calculations, the Group has assumed no changes
in currencies other than those used. The impact from the translation of functional currency-denominated
financial instruments, and assets, liabilities, profit and expense of foreign operations into yen is not
included. This is based on the assumption that other variable factors (such as balances and interest rate)
are constant.

The above figures in parentheses represent negative effects on profit or loss and equity of the Group in the case where the
yen’s value increases by 1% against each currency. The above amounts show effects of currency translation on the Group’s
consolidated financial statements, and do not have direct positive or negative effects on its cash flows and business
management.
(iii) Forward exchange contracts and others
With regard to management of derivative transactions, including forward exchange contracts, the Group
has established management rules for derivative transactions and limits derivative transactions to those
made for the purpose of hedging risks.
The Group may enter into forward exchange contracts and other agreements to fix future cash flows
related to lending and borrowing of funds within the Group in association with receivables and payables
denominated in foreign currencies or to determine the amount of dividends within the Group. In this
case, the Group also manages these contracts appropriately in accordance with the internal rules.
The breakdown of forward exchange contracts and others is presented in “(8) Fair value of financial
instruments (ii) Fair value of derivatives.”
-62-2) Interest rate risk
(i) Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to various interest rate risks in its business activities, and fluctuations in interest
rates associated with borrowings especially affect its operating results. However, the effect of interest
rate fluctuations on borrowing costs is offset by income arising from assets that are affected by the
interest rate fluctuations.
The Group monitors fluctuations in interest rates arising from these assets and liabilities, and manages
interest rate risks through refinancing and other means when interest rates drastically fluctuate.
(ii) Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The impact of a 1% increase in interest rates for each reporting period on profit before taxes of the Group
is as follows.
In this analysis, calculation is made by multiplying balances of financial instruments with variable
interest rates held by the Group as of the end of each reporting period by 1%, assuming that all other
variables are constant.

3) Risk of fluctuations in equity instrument prices
(i) Management of risk of fluctuations in equity instrument prices
The Group is exposed to risk of fluctuations in share prices arising from equity instruments (shares). The
Group has no equity instruments held for short-term trading and owns equity instruments to smoothly
execute business strategies. The Group does not sell these investments actively. With regard to equity
instruments, the Group regularly assesses and monitors fair value and financial conditions of issuers.
(ii) Price sensitivity analysis
For equity instruments (shares) held by the Group, the following table shows impact of a 10% decrease
in the share price on other comprehensive income (before the application of tax effects) of the Group,
assuming that all other variables are constant.

¥1,127 million of cumulative losses, respectively.
In FY2018 and FY2019, dividend income from financial assets measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income that were sold (derecognized) are ¥3 million and ¥7 million, respectively.
(5) Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities
As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, there were no significant financial instruments that
were offset in the consolidated statements of financial position. Among financial assets and financial
liabilities that were recognized for the same counterparty, there were also no significant financial
instruments that were under enforceable master netting arrangements or similar contracts but were not
offset as they did not meet certain or all criteria of offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities.
-65-(6) Credit risk management
Credit risks are risks that result in financial losses incurred by the Group when a customer goes into default
for contractual obligations. The Group has the sales department and the accounting and finance department
monitor the status of business partners in terms of trade receivables, etc., regularly and manage due dates
and balances for each business partner while working to early identify and mitigate any concerns about
collections due to deterioration in each business partner’s financial position and other factors. When full or
partial collection of trade receivables, etc., is considered impossible, or extremely difficult, it is deemed to
be a default.
With respect to shares in securities and investment securities, the financial situation of issuers is assessed
regularly in accordance with the management rules of each group company. With respect to public and
corporate bonds, credit risk is insignificant because the Group invests solely in highly rated bonds.
The Group recognizes that there is extremely insignificant credit risk in the use of derivatives since it only
deals with financial institutions with high credit ratings to mitigate credit risk.
The Group does not have any credit risk overly concentrated in a specific counterparty or a group to which
the counterparty belongs.
1) Allowance for credit losses
When financial assets are impaired, the Group does not reduce the impairment directly from the carrying
amount and accounts for the impairment in the allowance for credit losses account. Changes in allowance
for credit losses are as follows.

represent the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk of financial assets.
(7) Liquidity risk management
The Group manages liquidity risk by having the accounting and finance department prepares and updates a
cash flow management plan, maintaining a constant level of liquidity. A temporary shortage of cash due to
the payment of dividends, bonuses and other items is covered by a loan from a bank or other financial
institution.
The balance of financial liabilities other than liability on guarantee (including derivative financial
instruments) by maturity is as follows. The details of the lease liabilities are provided in Note “20. Leases.”

Securities
The fair value of securities is determined based on the quoted price at the securities exchange.
Borrowings
The fair value of borrowings with floating interest rates reflects market interest rates in the short term,
and the carrying amount approximates to that fair value. The fair value of borrowings with fixed interest
rates is determined by the method in which future cash flows are discounted, using an interest rate which
approximates to when funds are borrowed under the same terms and conditions with the same remaining
borrowing period.
Bonds
The fair value of bonds is determined based on the observable price in the market.

Forward exchange contracts and others
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and others is calculated based on the market price of
forward exchange contracts and others entered into on similar terms and conditions.
Interest rate swaps
Interest rate swaps are used for the purpose of reducing interest borne on borrowings, and their fair value
is calculated based on the value presented by creditor financial institutions.
Currency swaps
Currency swaps are used for the purpose of reducing foreign currency risks on currencies of borrowings,
and their fair value is calculated based on the value presented by creditor financial institutions.

Equity instruments
The fair values of equity instruments are measured using a valuation technique appropriate to
characteristics of the instrument, such as the comparable company analysis method and the option
pricing method.

(Acquisition of Visterra, Inc.)
On July 11, 2018, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Otsuka”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company,
entered into an agreement to acquire all shares of Visterra, Inc. (“Visterra”), which is engaged in research and
development of pharmaceutical products in the United States, through an acquisition company set up by
Otsuka America, Inc. (“Otsuka America”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. This acquisition was
completed on August 31, 2018.
(i) Overview of business combination
(a) Name of company acquired and nature of business
Name of company acquired: Visterra, Inc.
Nature of business: Research and development of pharmaceutical products
(b) Primary reasons for business combination
Visterra has unique antibody platform technologies (Hierotope® platform) that enable computer
estimations of three-dimensional structures of a portion of a protein deemed essential for its function,
simulations of the structure in combination with numerous partial structures of antibodies, detection
of optimal antibody structures, and design of antibody drugs. These technologies may make it
possible to develop antibody drugs to many biological materials that were previously considered
difficult to address. Visterra has already created several clinical development products from the
antibody technologies, and it also has multiple programs that will move to clinical development soon.
Among them, a clinical trial was launched for “VIS649,” which is aimed at treatment of IgA
nephropathy, as an effective therapeutic approach to this disease for which there is currently no
approved medication.
Otsuka will promote further drug development by newly acquiring the base for antibody drug
discovery, in addition to the existing base for small-molecule drug discovery, through this acquisition.
(c) Acquisition date

(2) Contingent consideration
Contingent considerations arose from the business combination of Neurovance, Inc. and ReCor Medical Inc.
The contingent considerations from the acquisition of Neurovance, Inc. consist of the milestones to be paid
based on the progress of the development of centanafadine, which is a compound under development as a
treatment of ADHD, obtained when the Group acquired Neurovance, Inc. in March 2017, and the ones to be
paid based on the revenue after the launch of centanafadine. The maximum potential amounts of the
milestones will be USD 125 million and USD 750 million, respectively.
The contingent considerations from the acquisition of ReCor Medical Inc. are the milestones to be paid based
on the progress of the development of the ultrasound renal denervation device obtained by the Group at its
acquisition in June 2018. The maximum potential amount of the milestones will be USD 125 million.
The fair value of the contingent considerations is estimated based on the probability-weighted present value of
the potential amount to be paid to the counterparty.
The level of contingent considerations in the fair value hierarchy is classified as Level 3.
The fair value changes of the contingent considerations attributable to time value is recognized in “Finance
costs,” and the one attributable to changes of non-time-value is recognized in either “Other income” or “Other
expenses.”

－9－Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Reporting Entity
Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) is a company incorporated in Japan. The
addresses of its registered head office and principal business office are disclosed on the Company’s website
(URL https://www.otsuka.com/en/). The consolidated financial statements of the Company, which were
prepared with the end of the fiscal year on December 31, 2022, comprise the Company and its subsidiaries
(hereinafter referred to as the “Group”) and interests in its associates.
The details of businesses and principal business activities of the Group are provided in Note “5. Operating
Segments.”
2. Basis of Preparation
(1) Compliance with IFRS
Pursuant to the provision of Article 93 of the Ordinance on Consolidated Financial Statements, the
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in compliance with IFRS since the
Company qualifies as a “Specified Company under Designated International Accounting Standards”
prescribed in Article 1-2 of the Ordinance.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 were
approved on March 24, 2023 by Tatsuo Higuchi, President and Representative Director, CEO, and Yuko
Makino, Executive Director, CFO.
(2) Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for financial
instruments and other items measured at fair value.
(3) Functional currency and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Japanese yen, which is the Company’s functional
currency, and figures are rounded down to the nearest million yen.
(4) New standards not yet adopted
Among the standards and interpretations newly issued or amended by the date of approval that is provided
in “(1) Compliance with IFRS,” there were no new or amended standards and interpretations that have
been early adopted by the Group as of December 31, 2022. The impact of the adoption of these standards
and interpretations has not been provided because it is expected to be insignificant.
3. Significant Accounting Policies
(1) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when the
Group has power over the investee, is exposed or has rights to variable returns arising from the Group’s
involvement in the investee and has an ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the
date that the Group obtains control until the date that control is lost.
If any accounting policies applied by a subsidiary differ from those applied by the Group, adjustments
are made to the subsidiary’s financial statements when needed. The balances of receivables and payables
among the Group and inter-company transactions as well as unrealized gains or losses arising from inter-
company transactions are offset in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
When the ownership interest in a subsidiary is partially disposed of, the transaction is accounted for as an
equity transaction if the Group retains control over the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount of
－10－adjustment to the non-controlling interests and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is
recognized directly in equity attributable to owners of the Company.
If the Group loses control over the subsidiary, gains or losses derived from such loss are recognized in
profit or loss.
(ii) Associates
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence in terms of financial and operating
policies but which the Group does not control or jointly control. The Group is presumed to have
significant influence over another entity when it holds at least 20% but 50% or less of the voting rights of
the entity.
Investments in associates are recognized at cost at the time of acquisition and subsequently accounted for
using the equity method. Goodwill recognized on acquisition is included in investments in associates.
Because such goodwill is not separately recognized, it is not tested for impairment separately. Instead,
the entire amount of the investments in associates is tested for impairment as a single asset whenever
objective evidence indicates that the investments in associates may be impaired.
If any accounting policies applied by an associate differ from those applied by the Group, adjustments
are made to the associate’s financial statements when needed.
When the Group has retained interests after losing significant influence, these interests are measured at
fair value and any difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the investment as of the
date on which the equity method was discontinued is recognized in profit or loss.
(2) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of non-
controlling interests in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held
equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed. In case the identifiable net asset exceeds the aggregate of the
consideration and others, such excess is immediately recognized in profit or loss.
The consideration transferred is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets
transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the
equity interests issued by the acquirer. The consideration transferred includes any assets or liabilities
resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. The amount of non-controlling interests in the
acquiree at the acquisition date is measured for each business combination either at fair value or as the
present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable
net assets.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date are measured at fair value as of
the acquisition date, except for limited exceptions based on the requirements of IFRS 3 “Business
Combinations.”
Transaction costs incurred in relation to business combinations are recognized as expenses when they are
incurred.
If the initial accounting for business combinations is incomplete by the end of the fiscal year in which the
business combinations occur, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting
is incomplete. Those provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date are retrospectively adjusted to
reflect new information obtained during the measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed
as of the acquisition date and, if known at the acquisition date, would have affected the measurement of the
amounts recognized. Additional assets or liabilities are recognized if new information is known to have
resulted in the additional recognition of assets or liabilities. The measurement period does not exceed one
year.
－11－(3) Foreign currency translation
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated to the functional currencies at exchange rates on the
transaction dates or exchange rates which are close to the actual rate on the transaction dates. Foreign
currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate on
each reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign
currency are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of measurement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at cost in a foreign currency are translated into the
functional currency using the spot exchange rate on the date of the original transaction.
Translation differences arising from translations or settlements are recognized as profit or loss. However,
equity instruments measured through other comprehensive income as well as the effective portion of
translation differences arising from hedging instruments related to cash flow hedges used to hedge
foreign currency risk are recognized as other comprehensive income.
(ii) Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rate on
each reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Japanese yen at
the average exchange rate for the reporting period. Translation differences arising from translation of
financial statements of foreign operations are recognized as other comprehensive income. The exchange
differences on translation of foreign operations are recognized in profit or loss for periods in which
foreign operations are disposed.
(4) Financial instruments
(i) Financial assets
i) Initial recognition and measurement
Trade and other receivables are initially recognized on the date when they are incurred. All other
financial assets are initially recognized on the contract date when the Group becomes a party to the
contract of the instruments.
At initial recognition, all financial assets, except for those measured at fair value through profit or
loss, are measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. However, trade receivables
that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at the transaction price.
Transaction costs of financial assets measured through profit or loss are recognized in profit or loss.
At initial recognition, financial assets are classified as (a) financial assets measured at amortized cost,
(b) debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, (c) equity
instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or (d) financial assets
measured at fair value through profit or loss.
(a) Financial assets measured at amortized cost
Financial assets are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost if both of the
following conditions are met.
 The financial assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial
assets in order to collect contractual cash flows.
 The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that
are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
(b) Debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Financial assets are classified as debt instruments measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met.
 The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both
collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
 The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that
are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
－12－(c) Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
For investments in some equity instruments, the Group has chosen an irrevocable option to
present subsequent changes in the fair value of investments that are neither ‘held for trading’
nor ‘contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination to which
IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” applies,’ in other comprehensive income. The Group
classifies such investments as equity instruments measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income.
(d) Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets, except for financial assets measured at amortized cost and equity instruments
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income stated above, are classified as
financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.
ii) Subsequent measurement
After initial recognition, financial assets are measured according to their classification as follows:
(a) Financial assets measured at amortized cost
Financial assets measured at amortized cost are measured at amortized cost using the effective
interest method. Amortization by using the effective interest method and any gains or losses on
derecognition are recognized in profit or loss.
(b) Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured
at fair value. Any changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income. When
such financial assets are derecognized, the accumulated other comprehensive income is
transferred to retained earnings. Meanwhile, dividends from such financial assets are
recognized as profit or loss.
(c) Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and
any changes in their fair value are recognized in profit or loss.
iii) Impairment
With regard to impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost, the Group recognizes an
allowance for expected credit losses on such financial assets.
At each reporting date, the Group evaluates whether the credit risk on financial instruments has
increased significantly after initial recognition.
If credit risk on financial instruments has not increased significantly after initial recognition, the
allowance for those instruments is measured at an amount equal to the 12-month expected credit
losses. If credit risk on financial instruments has increased significantly after initial recognition, the
allowance for such financial instruments is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected
credit losses.
The Group considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when contractual
payments are more than 30 days past due. The assessment of whether or not credit risk has increased
significantly takes into account all relevant current information that is reasonably available to the
Group, as well as past due information.
However, with regard to trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, the
allowance is always measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses, regardless of
whether or not there has been a significant increase in credit risk after initial recognition.
iv) Derecognition
The Group derecognizes financial assets only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
financial assets expire, or when the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of the financial assets.
－13－(ii) Financial liabilities
i) Initial recognition and measurement
Bonds and borrowings are initially recognized on the date when they are issued or incurred. All other
financial liabilities are initially recognized on the contract date when the Group becomes a party to
the contract of the financial instruments.
At initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as (a) financial liabilities measured at
amortized cost or (b) financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss.
At initial recognition, financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are measured at fair value net of
transaction costs that are directly attributable to the financial liabilities. Transaction costs of financial
liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in profit or loss.
ii) Subsequent measurement
After initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured according to their classification as follows:
(a) Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method. Amortization by using the effective interest method and any gains or
losses on derecognition are recognized in profit or loss.
(b) Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and
any changes in their fair value are recognized in profit or loss.
iii) Derecognition
The Group derecognizes the financial liabilities only when they are extinguished, that is, the
obligations specified in the contract are discharged, cancelled or expired.
(iii) Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented only when the Group
currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amount and intends either to settle on a
net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
(iv) Derivatives and hedge accounting
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value. After initial recognition, derivatives continue to be
measured at fair value.
The Group designates certain derivatives such as forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swap
agreements, currency option transactions, and interest rate swap agreements to hedge foreign currency
risk and interest rate risk.
At the inception of a hedging relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedging
relationship and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The
documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk
being hedged, and the methods of assessing whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge
effectiveness requirements. The Group assesses whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge
effectiveness requirements, both at inception and on an ongoing basis. Ongoing assessments are
performed at each reporting date or upon a significant change in the circumstances affecting the hedge
effectiveness requirements, whichever comes first.
The Group applies hedge accounting to cash flow hedges which meet the criteria for hedge accounting
and such hedges are accounted for as follows:
The portions of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that are determined to be effective hedges are
recognized in other comprehensive income, while the remaining ineffective portions are recognized in
profit or loss. The amounts associated with the hedging instruments recognized in other comprehensive
income are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged transactions affect profit or loss. However, in
cases where the hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial
－14－asset or liability, the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is accounted for as an
adjustment to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
When the hedging relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria, or the hedging instrument expires or
is sold, terminated or exercised, the application of hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. When
forecast transactions or firm commitments are no longer expected to occur, any related cumulative gains
or losses that have been recognized in equity through other comprehensive income are reclassified to
profit or loss.
The Group does not undertake any fair value hedges or any hedges of net investment in foreign
operations.
(5) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term investments with
original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are so
near maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value.
(6) Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated
costs necessary to make the sale. The cost of inventories is determined mainly by the weighted-average
cost formula. The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs
incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition.
(7) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are measured under the cost model and carried at their cost less any
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of property, plant and equipment includes the cost directly incidental to the acquisition of assets,
the initial estimated costs of dismantling, removing and restoring the assets.
Depreciation expense for assets except for land and construction in progress is recognized mainly by the
straight-line method over the respective estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of major asset
items are as follows:
 Buildings and structures: 2 to 65 years
 Machinery and vehicles: 2 to 40 years
 Tools, furniture and fixtures: 2 to 20 years
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods of assets are reviewed at the end of
each fiscal year, and any changes are applied prospectively as a change in an accounting estimate.
(8) Goodwill
Measurement of goodwill at initial recognition is provided in “(2) Business combinations.” After initial
recognition, the amount is recorded at its cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to each of the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units (hereinafter
referred to as the “Cash-Generating Units”) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business
combination. Cash-Generating Units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment
annually and whenever there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of
Cash-Generating Units is less than their carrying amounts, an impairment loss is recognized in profit or
loss. With regard to allocation of impairment losses recognized in association with Cash-Generating Units,
first the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the unit is reduced, and then the remaining amount of
impairment loss is allocated to other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each
asset in the unit. For impairment losses recognized on goodwill, no reversal is made in subsequent periods.
－15－(9) Intangible assets
Intangible assets are measured under the cost model and carried at their cost less any accumulated
amortization and impairment losses.
Separately acquired intangible assets are initially measured at cost.
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
Internally generated intangible assets, other than development expenses that meet the requirements for
capitalization, are recognized as an expense when incurred.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives. The estimated useful lives of major intangible assets are as follows:
 Patents: 5 to 15 years
 Trademarks, distribution rights and others: 2 to 20 years
 Software: 2 to 10 years
The estimated useful lives, residual values and amortization methods are reviewed at the end of each fiscal
year, and any changes are applied prospectively as a change in an accounting estimate.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives consist mainly of brands and trademarks acquired separately or
in business combinations, and are included in intangible assets as “Trademarks, distribution rights and
others.” Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed at the end of each fiscal year to
determine whether the indefinite useful life assessment remains appropriate. If it is no longer appropriate,
the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is accounted for as a change in an
accounting estimate.
In-process research and development acquired separately or through a business combination is included in
intangible assets as “In-process research and development.” As these assets are intangible assets that are
not yet available for use, they are tested for impairment without amortization. An asset in “In-process
research and development” is transferred to “Trademarks, distribution rights and others” when the asset
becomes available for use by obtaining permits and approvals from regulatory authorities in a subsequent
period, and begins to be amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life from that time.
(10) Leases
For the leases that the Group has contracted as a lessee, right-of-use assets are measured at cost, and lease
liabilities are measured at the present value of total lease payments.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or lease
terms, whichever is shorter. The depreciation periods of right-of-use assets of major underlying asset items
are as follows:
 Buildings and structures: 2 to 50 years
 Machinery and vehicles: 2 to 15 years
 Tools, furniture and fixtures: 2 to 6 years
 Land: 2 to 50 years
Lease payments are recognized upon apportionment between the finance expenses and the repayments of
lease liabilities based on the interest method.
The Group does not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases on intangible assets and
short-term leases within 12 months. The Group recognizes the total lease payments associated with short-
term leases on either a straight-line method or another systematic basis over the lease term.
(11) Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
The Group assesses whether there is any indication of impairment at the end of each reporting period for
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (including right-of-use assets; the same applies
hereinafter). If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. When it is not
possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. A cash-generating unit is the smallest
－16－identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows
from other assets or groups of assets. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives or those not yet available
for use are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the intangible assets
may be impaired.
The recoverable amount of an individual asset or a cash-generating unit is measured at the higher of its fair
value less cost of disposal or its value in use. The value in use is calculated by discounting the estimated
future cash flows to the present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the time value of money
and the risks specific to the asset.
The corporate assets do not independently generate cash inflows. When there is an indication of
impairment of the corporate assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the
corporate assets belong is calculated.
An impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss when the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating
unit exceeds the recoverable amount.
For an impairment loss recognized in prior periods, the Group assesses whether there is any indication of a
decrease or disappearance of the impairment loss at the end of each reporting period. If there is any
indication of reversal of the impairment loss, the recoverable amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is
estimated. In cases in which the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the asset or cash-
generating unit, the impairment loss is reversed up to the lower of the recoverable amount or the carrying
amount less any depreciation and amortization costs that would have been determined had no impairment
loss been recognized.
(12) Assets held for sale
Assets or groups of assets expected to be recovered not by continuous use but by sale are classified as non-
current assets or disposal groups held for sale when they are quite likely to be sold within one year, they
are available for immediate sale in its present condition, and management of the Group is committed to
such sale. In such case, non-current assets are neither depreciated nor amortized, and are measured at
carrying amount or fair value less cost of sales, whichever is lower.
(13) Post-employment benefits
The Group has defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans as post-employment benefit plans for
its employees.
The Group uses the projected unit credit method to determine the present value of the defined benefit
obligations, the related current service cost and the past service cost.
The discount rate is determined based on market yields on high quality corporate bonds at the end of the
fiscal year that are consistent with the discount period, which is set for the projected period until the
expected date of benefit payment in each fiscal year.
Net defined benefit liabilities or assets are calculated by deducting the fair value of the plan assets from the
present value of the defined benefit obligations. If the defined benefit plan has surplus, the defined benefit
asset is limited to the asset ceiling that is the present value of any future economic benefits available in the
form of reductions in the future contributions to the plan or cash refunds.
Service costs and net interest on the net defined benefit liabilities (assets) are recognized in profit or loss.
The remeasured amount of a defined benefit plan is recognized at once in other comprehensive income
when it occurs, and immediately transferred to retained earnings.
Contributions to the defined contribution retirement benefits are recognized as expenses when employees
have rendered service.
(14) Provisions
Provisions are recognized when there are present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events,
it is probable that outflows of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligations, and reliable estimates can be made of the amount of obligations.
－17－The amount recognized as provisions is the best estimate taking into account the risks and uncertainties of
the expenditure required to settle the present obligations on each reporting date. When the time value of
money is material, the amount of provision is measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to
be required to settle the obligation.
(15) Treasury shares
Treasury shares are measured at acquisition cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognized
associated with the purchase, sale or retirement of treasury shares of the Company. Any difference between
the carrying amount and the consideration received from the sale is recognized as capital surplus.
(16) Share-based payments
(i) Equity-settled share-based payment plan
The Group has adopted a restricted stock remuneration plan accounted for as an equity-settled share-
based payment.
Restricted stock remuneration is measured at fair value at the grant date and recognized as expenses over
the vesting periods from the grant date with the corresponding amounts as increases in equity. The fair
value of restricted stock remuneration is measured by reference to fair value of granted shares of the
Company.
(ii) Cash-settled share-based payment plan
The Group has granted equity-linked remuneration entitlements to eligible personnel under a cash-settled
share-based payment plan.
Cash-settled share-based payment is measured at the fair value of payment amount and recognized as
expenses over the vesting periods with the corresponding amounts as increases in liabilities. The Group
remeasures the fair value of those liabilities at the end of each reporting period until the liabilities are
settled, and recognizes any changes of fair value in profit or loss.
(17) Revenue
(i) Sales of products
For sales of products, the performance obligation is judged to have been satisfied and revenue is
therefore recognized upon delivery of the products because legal title, physical possession, significant
risks and rewards of ownership of the products are transferred to a customer upon delivery, and the
customer obtains control over the products.
Products may be sold with a rebate based upon the achievement of a defined sales volume and amount.
In such a case, the transaction price is recognized as the consideration promised in the contract with a
customer, less estimated rebates and other items. Rebates are measured by the ‘most likely amount’
method based on historical performance. Revenue is recognized only to the extent that it is highly
probable that significant reversal will not occur.
Specifically, in connection with rebates for Medicaid, Medicare and Commercial Managed Care Program
in the U.S., the Group estimates statutory and contractual rebate payments related to the public healthcare
system provided by federal and state governments, and contractual rebate payments with medical
institutions and customers to prepare for possible refunds after the end of the fiscal year. The Group
estimates the accrual amounts through the process such as identifying the target products of each
program, applicable product prices, estimated inventory at pharmacies and wholesalers, and time lag
between sales of products and payment of rebates. However, these estimates are uncertain and may differ
from the actual amount incurred. The Group reasonably evaluates whether the estimates of variable
consideration are constrained, taking into account the impact of potential changes such as past
experiences on the related contracts, consistency between the paid rebates and contract clauses, and
demand forecasts. As a result of this evaluation, the Group judges the constraints are limited. The
estimated amount of these rebate payments is recorded in “Other current liabilities” on the consolidated
statement of financial position.
－18－The majority of the consideration for sales is received within one year from the date of delivery.
Therefore, the promised amount of consideration does not include a significant financing component.
(ii) License and royalty income
License income includes up-front and milestone payments that the Group receives from a third party
based on license agreements for development and distribution right and others of developing or finished
products. Under license agreements, if contractual obligations are fulfilled at a point in time, up-front
payments are recognized as revenue once development and distribution rights and others are granted, and
milestone payments are recognized as revenue when the contractual milestones are achieved. If
contractual obligations are fulfilled over a period of time, including those for certain license agreements
entered into between the Group and a third party for development and distribution rights and others of
products under development, in principle, the corresponding payments are recorded as contract liabilities
and the income from up-front and milestone payments is recognized as revenue over a period such as an
estimated contract term, in accordance with the measurement method of progress towards satisfaction of
performance obligations. Income from milestone payments under license agreements is recognized as
revenue from the point when the conditions are met to avoid future reversal of revenues. The progress
towards satisfaction of performance obligations is obtained using an output measurement method such as
ratio between time elapsed and the remaining service provision period promised in the contract, etc. for
each contract such as development cooperation.
Royalty income is the income that is calculated based on the sales of counterparties under license
agreements, and is recognized as revenue at the later point of either the counterparty’s revenue
recognition, or satisfaction of performance obligations.
License and royalty income are received primarily within one year from the time when the rights are
acquired based on the agreements. Therefore, the agreements do not include significant financing
components.
(18) Government grants
Grant income is measured at fair value and recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the Group
will comply with the conditions attached to the grants and that the grants will be received. Grants for
revenue incurred are recorded as revenue in the fiscal year during which the expenses occurred. Grants for
the assets are recorded as revenue regularly over the useful life of the asset, and unearned grant income is
recorded as liability.
(19) Finance income and finance expenses
Finance income principally consists of interest income, dividend income, gain on fair value valuation and
foreign exchange gains. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. Dividend income
is recognized when the Group’s right to receive the dividend is established.
Finance expenses principally consist of interest expenses, loss on fair value valuation and foreign exchange
losses.
(20) Income taxes
Income taxes consist of current taxes and deferred taxes. These taxes are recognized in profit or loss,
except for those related to business combinations and items recognized directly in equity or other
comprehensive income.
Current taxes are calculated at the amount of expected tax payment to or expected tax refund from tax
authorities. The amount of taxes is computed in accordance with tax rates and tax laws that are in effect or
substantially in effect by the end of the fiscal year in countries where the Group conducts business
activities and earns taxable profits or losses.
Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between accounting carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities at the reporting date and amounts of them for tax purposes, unused tax losses and unused tax
credits.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recorded for the following temporary differences:
－19－ Temporary differences arising from goodwill
 Temporary differences arising from initial recognition of assets and liabilities which occur through
transactions that affect neither accounting profit nor taxable profit for tax purposes, except for business
combinations
 In cases where, for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and
associates, timing of reversal can be controlled and it is highly probable that such temporary differences
are not reversed in a foreseeable period
 In cases where, for deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and
associates, it is highly probable that such temporary differences are not reversed to the extent
foreseeable
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized, in principle, for all taxable temporary differences, while deferred tax
assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is highly probable that
taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences could be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed annually, and reduced by the amount of deferred tax
assets for which taxable profit sufficient to use all or part of the deferred tax assets is unlikely to be earned.
Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed annually and recognized to the extent that it is highly
probable that deferred tax assets are realizable with future taxable profit.
The Company and certain subsidiaries apply the consolidated taxation system.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in accordance with tax rates and tax laws expected to be
applied in the period in which the assets are realized or the liabilities are settled based on tax rates and tax
laws that are in effect or substantially in effect at the end of the fiscal year.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
assets against current tax liabilities, and they are related to income taxes levied by the same taxation
authority on the same taxable entity.
(21) Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity
holders of the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares issued during the period that
is adjusted by the number of treasury shares. Diluted earnings per share are calculated reflecting the
adjustment of the impact from all diluted shares with dilutive effect.
4. Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgments
In preparing IFRS-compliant consolidated financial statements, the management is required to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Such estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The effects of the review of
accounting estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the review was conducted and future
accounting periods.
Estimates and judgments that have significant effects on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial
statements are as follows:
 Impairment of intangible assets (Note “3. Significant Accounting Policies (11) Impairment of property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets” and Note “14. Impairment of Assets”)
 Fair value of the financial instruments (Note “33. Financial Instruments” and Note “36. Business
Combinations”)
 Recoverability of deferred tax assets (Note “16. Income Taxes”)
 Measurements of defined benefit obligations (Note “23. Post-employment Benefits”)
 Estimation of statutory and contractual rebates related to the public healthcare system in the U.S. (Note “3.
Significant Accounting Policies (17) Revenue” and Note “21. Other Liabilities”)
Changes in circumstances occurring in the future pandemic of COVID-19 are uncertain, and there is a risk
that they could significantly affect the reported amounts for assets, liabilities, income and expenses for the
－20－following fiscal year and thereafter.
5. Operating Segments
(1) Overview of reportable segments
The Group’s reportable segments are the constituent units of the Group for which separate financial
information is available and which are subject to periodic reviews by the Board of Directors in order to
make decisions on allocation of business resources and to evaluate the business performances of the
respective segments.

5 Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, entered into an agreement on May 12, 2022
(Japan time) to acquire all shares of Cullinan Pearl Corp. (a then 20% equity-method affiliate of the Company) held by
Cullinan Oncology, Inc., thereby making Cullinan Pearl Corp. a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
As a result of conducting a concentration test in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” for
the above transaction, the Group determined that substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired was
concentrated in a single identifiable asset (TAS6417, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor), and that
－31－because the integrated set of activities and assets acquired did not qualify as a business, the Group recorded this
transaction as an asset acquisition (¥48,370 million recorded as in-process research and development).
(4) Assets pledged as collateral
Not applicable.
(5) Individually significant intangible assets
Major intangible assets recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position are rights associated to
research and development of AVP-786, which were recognized in line with the acquisition of Avanir
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. executed in 2015. The carrying amounts of the rights associated to research and
development of AVP-786 are ¥164,248 million in FY2021 and ¥189,495 million in FY2022.
14. Impairment of Assets
(1) Impairment losses
In calculating impairment losses, the Group bases its grouping of assets on the smallest identifiable group
of assets that generates largely independent cash inflows.
Impairment losses are recorded as “Impairment losses” in the consolidated statements of income. In
addition, reversal of impairment losses is recorded in “Other income.”
The breakdown of impairment losses and reversals of impairment losses by segment is as follows:
(Millions of yen)
FY2021 FY2022
(Fiscal year ended (Fiscal year ended
December 31, 2021) December 31, 2022)
Pharmaceuticals 5,376 38,287

Consumer products 20 237
Others 1,006 108
Corporate 14 847
Total 6,479 41,521
Pharmaceuticals
Impairment losses of ¥5,376 million in the pharmaceutical business recognized in FY2021 consist of
impairment losses on property, plant and equipment of ¥555 million, on intangible assets of ¥3,999 million,
and on assets held for sale of ¥821 million.
The impairment losses on property, plant and equipment of ¥555 million are principally a reduction of the
carrying amount of machinery and vehicles to the recoverable amount of zero, which is value in use, as a
result of certain machinery becoming idle due to suspension of the operation.
The impairment losses on intangible assets of ¥3,999 million are principally a reduction of the carrying
amount of certain in-process research and development to the recoverable amount of zero, which is value
in use, as a result of reviewing the probability of success in the development due to a delay from the
original development schedule.
The impairment losses on assets held for sale of ¥821 million are principally a reduction of the carrying
amount of assets held for sale to the fair value less costs to sell due to the decision made to sell certain
businesses.
Impairment losses of ¥38,287 million in the pharmaceutical business recognized in FY2022 consist of
impairment losses on property, plant and equipment of ¥2,349 million, on intangible assets of ¥20,472
million, on other current assets of ¥3,127 million, and on other non-current assets of ¥12,338 million.
－32－The impairment losses on property, plant and equipment of ¥2,349 million are principally a reduction of
the carrying amount of buildings and structures (right-of-use assets) to the recoverable amount of zero,
which is the value in use, as a result of the consolidation of office space at headquarters at certain
consolidated subsidiaries.
The impairment losses on intangible assets of ¥20,472 million are principally the impairment loss on
vadadustat, which was under development for the indication of anemia associated with chronic kidney
disease.
The impairment losses on other current assets of ¥3,127 million and the impairment losses on other non-
current assets of ¥12,338 million are the impairment loss on vadadustat, which was under development for
the indication of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease.
Concerning vadadustat, an application for the drug’s approval was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for the indication of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease during or prior
to the dialysis phase. However, the Group received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA
conveying that it would be unable to approve the current application, and carrying amounts of in-process
research and development recorded in intangible assets and other related assets were reduced to zero.
(2) Impairment test of goodwill
The Company considers cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated, in principle, as cash-
generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination.
The breakdown of the carrying amount of goodwill by segment and by major cash-generating unit is as
follows:
(Millions of yen)
FY2021 FY2022
(As of December 31, 2021) (As of December 31, 2022)
Pharmaceuticals 238,192 274,572
Prescription drugs and clinical nutrition
224,862 259,427
products
Nutraceuticals 51,661 54,912
Consumer products 490 566
Others 5,391 5,391
Total 295,735 335,442
The Group tests major goodwill for impairment in each fiscal period, or whenever there is an indication of
impairment as follows:
Prescription drugs and clinical nutrition products
Goodwill allocated to prescription drugs and clinical nutrition products is principally recognized in
association with acquisitions of U.S.-based Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,
Visterra, Inc. and others, and its carrying amount is ¥259,427 million (FY2021: ¥224,862 million).
The recoverable amount in impairment test is determined based on value in use. Value in use reflects past
experience and external information, and is calculated by discounting the estimated amount of cash flows
based on the business plan for the next five years approved by the management to the present value. The
estimated amount of cash flows reflects the probability of obtaining sales approval from regulatory
authorities (probability of success), and sales forecasts and market share after the launch. The pre-tax
weighted average cost of capital for the cash-generating unit is used as the discount rate, which is 10.1%
(FY2021: 8.4%). Beyond the forecast period of the business plan, considering future uncertainty, the
amount of cash flows is assumed to equal to the amount for the final fiscal year of the business plan with
the subsequent growth rate deemed to be 0%.
There is a risk that impairment may occur when key assumptions used in the impairment test are changed.
However, the value in use adequately exceeds the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit, and even if
－33－key assumptions used in the impairment test change, provided the change is within a reasonably predictable
range, it is considered unlikely that the value in use will fall below the carrying amount.
(3) Impairment test of in-process research and development
As intangible assets are not yet available for use, in-process research and development is tested for
impairment in each fiscal period, or whenever there is an indication of impairment. The recoverable
amount in impairment test is determined based on value in use.
Value in use reflects past experience and external information, and is calculated by discounting the
estimated amount of cash flows based on the business plan approved by the management to the present
value. The pre-tax weighted average cost of capital for the cash-generating unit is used as the discount rate.
The measurement of value in use reflects the probability of obtaining sales approval from regulatory
authorities (probability of success), and sales forecasts and market share after the launch, and the
management considers assumptions used in these estimates appropriate. However, there is uncertainty in
the healthcare market of which the environment changes rapidly, and therefore, if the assumed situation
changes due to a delay or halt of the development and launches of competing products, the calculation
result of the value in use could be different.
In-process research and development in FY2022 is principally rights related to research and development
of AVP-786, and their carrying amount is ¥189,495 million (FY2021: ¥164,248 million) and their discount

－35－Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax
credits to the extent that it is highly probable that taxable profits will be available against which they could
be utilized. In assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, reversal of deferred tax liabilities,
expected future taxable profit and tax planning are taken into account, and the carrying amount is reviewed
each fiscal year based on the level of taxable profit in the past and estimated future taxable profit in the
period during which deferred tax assets are deductible. The Group considers it is probable that deferred tax
assets recognized as of December 31, 2022 will be recovered.
The future taxable profit and tax planning are estimated based on the Group’s business plan. If a different
result from forecasts such as revenue in the business plan occurs, this may have a significant impact on the
amount of deferred tax assets in the consolidated financial statements for the following fiscal year.

Unused tax losses 39,163 41,405
Unused tax credits 316 812
Total 381,266 436,247
Deferred tax assets on the above items are not recognized because there is a low probability that temporary
differences will be reversed in the foreseeable future, or it is not highly probable that future taxable income
necessary for the Group to utilize the benefits arises. Deductible temporary differences do not expire under
current tax law.

Provision for asset retirement obligations
The Group records provision for asset retirement obligations at the estimated amount of costs for removal of
harmful substances related to non-current assets and the estimated amount of restoration costs for rented
offices and others for which the Group has obligations to restore the site to its original condition at the end of
the lease contract.
The Group expects that the timing at which economic resources flow out is principally after one year passed
from the end of each fiscal year.
Provision for loss on contracts
Provisions have been recorded for onerous contracts concerning co-promotion agreements related to some
prescription drugs.
The Group expects that the timing at which economic resources flow out is principally within one year from
the end of each fiscal year. “Decrease during the year (utilization)” in FY2022 is due to the transfer to “Trade
and other payables.”
23. Post-employment Benefits
The Group has adopted defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans as post-employment benefit
－43－plans.
Major domestic subsidiaries have a contributory funded, defined benefit corporate pension plan and lump-sum
retirement payments plan as defined benefit plans, and defined contribution pension plans as defined
contribution plans.
Certain foreign subsidiaries have contributory funded or unfunded defined benefit plans, defined contribution
plans, or a combination of them.
Among defined benefit plans, the major plan is the defined benefit plan in Japan, which accounts for
approximately 90% of total defined benefit obligations. In the current fiscal year, some domestic subsidiaries
have abolished early retirement plans.
There is no post-employment benefit other than pensions and lump-sum payments.
For the accounting policy for defined benefit plans, please refer to Note “3. Significant Accounting Policies
(13) Post-employment benefits.”
Defined benefit obligations are calculated using an actuarial technique, and actuarial assumptions include an
estimate of discount rate. These assumptions may be affected by uncertain future economic conditions or
changes in social situations, and other factors. If a different result from their assumptions occurs, this may
have a significant impact on the amounts of net defined benefit liabilities and net defined benefit assets
included in other non-current assets in the consolidated financial statements for the following fiscal year.
(1) Defined benefit plans
For benefits under defined benefit plans of the Company and major domestic subsidiaries, the amount of
retirement benefit payments is calculated based on service years, salaries during the service period, position
and other factors. When the period of validity of a retiring employee equals to or more than a certain
period, benefits are paid as lump-sum payment or pension at the option of the employee. Upon retirement,
etc. of employees, additional retirement benefits that do not qualify as benefits under defined benefit plans
may be paid.
Defined benefit corporate pension plans are managed by Otsuka Pharmaceuticals corporate pension fund.
Directors of this pension fund and the pension plan management institution are required by laws and
regulations to behave in a way that gives utmost priority to the interest of plan participants and former
participants and assume the responsibility for managing plan assets under the prescribed policy.
Although defined benefit retirement benefit plans are exposed to general investment risk, interest rate risk
and others, it is considered that the exposure to these risks is not significant.

Management policy for plan assets
The fund management policy for major plans of the Group aims to secure stable returns over the medium to
long term to ensure the payment of defined benefit obligations now and in the future. Specifically, assets
are managed by setting the target rate of return and the asset mix by investment asset within a range of
acceptable risk defined annually and maintaining this mix.
－45－The Group conducts review of the asset mix where necessary, taking into account financial conditions of
defined benefit pension plans and the investment environment.
When management of each asset is implemented, the Group seeks efficiency on the investment aspect
through continuous monitoring with attention to risk diversification associated to asset managers.
The fair value of the plan assets is as follows:

Any economic resource is not available because future contributions are not reduced or refunded.
Consequently, an unrecognized surplus has arisen in some pension plans of the Group.
Principal actuarial assumptions at the end of the reporting period are as follows:

changes in actuarial assumptions.
These items are recognized in other comprehensive income when occurred and immediately transferred
from other components of equity to retained earnings.

Of the opening balance of contract liabilities, the amount of revenue recognized is ¥12,710 million in
FY2021 and ¥12,322 million in FY2022. The contract liabilities balance increased by ¥4,290 million in
FY2022 (FY2021: ¥92 million) due to the receipt of up-front payments under license agreements for
development and distribution rights and others of products under development, achievement of milestones,
and others.
The amount of revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in the past
period was ¥11,682 million for FY2021 and ¥25,835 million for FY2022, of which major revenue was
license and royalty income.
(3) Timing of satisfaction of performance obligations
Contract liabilities mainly arise in certain license agreements entered into between the Group and a third
party for development and distribution rights and others of products under development. In principle, the
corresponding consideration is recorded as contract liabilities when the agreement is concluded or when
milestones are achieved, regardless of satisfaction of performance obligations. In addition, contract
－51－liabilities are recognized as revenue over a period such as a contract term according to the satisfaction of
performance obligations such as development cooperation determined by each contract. In the license
agreements above, there is no consideration from the contract with a customer that is not included in the
transaction price. In addition, contract liabilities include advances received from customers in relation to
sale of products.
The total amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations and timing when
revenue is expected to be recognized are as follows:

32. Share-based Payments
The Group has introduced a restricted stock remuneration plan for Directors of the Company (excluding
Outside Directors) and certain Directors of its subsidiaries aiming at granting incentives so as to achieve the
medium-term management plan, to sustainably improve the medium- to long-term performance and corporate
value of the Company, and to further share more of that value with shareholders.
In addition, the Group has granted equity-linked remuneration entitlements under a cash-settled share-based
payment plan to officers and employees of certain consolidated subsidiaries. The Group grants the
entitlements to employees who have the rank as of the time of grant and makes the payment in cash, taking
into account the level of achievement of performance targets and the share price at the end of the period for
each cycle: from cycle of one-year period to cycle of three-year period.

(hereinafter referred to as “Eligible Directors”).
2 The Company has entered into, with each Eligible Director, a restricted stock allocation agreement, which contains the
provisions that Eligible Directors shall not transfer, attach security interest, and make other dispositions of the Company’s
ordinary shares allotted (hereinafter referred to as the “Allotted Shares”), and that the Company acquires the Allotted
Shares at no cost upon the occurrence of specified events.
3 The Company shall remove the transfer restriction on the Allotted Shares on the condition that (1) the Eligible Director
continuously holds a position as Director of the Company (Director of its subsidiary, if the Eligible Director is a Director
of its subsidiary) during the transfer restriction period and (2) targets set by the Company in advance in light of
consolidated revenue, operating profit and other metrics are achieved. If it is determined that a person eligible for
allotment retires due to the expiration of the term of office or any other reasonable cause, the time of release from the
transfer restriction and the number of shares to be released from the transfer restriction will be reasonably adjusted as
necessary.
4 The method of measuring fair value is calculated based on the closing price of shares of the Company on the Prime
Market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange on the business day prior to the date of a resolution of the Board of Directors.

(3) Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to financial risks (market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk) in the course of
operating activities and conducts risk management in accordance with its policy to mitigate these financial
risks. The Group uses derivative transactions to avoid foreign currency risk or interest rate risk and, in
accordance with its policy, does not carry out any speculative transactions.
(4) Market risk management
The Group’s activities are mainly exposed to risks of changes in economic circumstances and financial
market circumstances. Specifically, the risks of changes in financial market circumstances include 1)
foreign currency risk, 2) interest rate risk, and 3) risk of fluctuations in equity instrument prices.
1) Foreign currency risks
(i) Foreign currency risk management
The Group engages in business globally, and fluctuations in exchange rates of the US dollar and Euro,
principally, affect its operating results.
With regard to settlement of receivables and payables arising from ongoing operating activities, the
Group’s policy is to balance foreign exchange receipts and payments as much as possible with three
major currencies, namely, the US dollar, Euro and Japanese yen.
In addition, the Group has established management rules for derivative transactions and limits derivative
transactions, including forward foreign exchange contracts, to those for the purpose of hedging risks.
Information on derivative transactions conducted by the Group is provided in “(8) Fair value of financial
instruments (ii) Fair value of derivatives.”
(ii) Foreign exchange sensitivity analysis
The Group is principally exposed to foreign currency risks of US dollar and Euro. The following table
shows the sensitivity analysis in the case where the yen’s value increases by 1% against the US dollar
－58－and the Euro in each fiscal year. In making these calculations, the Group has assumed no changes in
currencies other than those used. The impact from the translation of functional currency-denominated
financial instruments, and assets, liabilities, income and expenses of foreign operations into yen is not
included. This is based on the assumption that other variable factors (such as balances and interest rate)
are constant.

The above figures in parentheses represent negative effects on profit or loss and equity of the Group in the case where the
yen’s value increases by 1% against each currency. The above figures show effects of currency translation on the Group’s
consolidated financial statements, and do not have direct positive or negative effects on its cash flows and business
management.
The Group’s exposures to foreign exchange fluctuation risks other than the US dollar and Euro are not significant.
2) Interest rate risk
(i) Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to various interest rate risks in its business activities, and fluctuations in interest
rates associated with borrowings especially affect its operating results. However, the effect of interest
rate fluctuations on borrowing costs is offset by income arising from assets that are affected by the
interest rate fluctuations.
The Group monitors fluctuations in interest rates arising from these assets and liabilities, and manages
interest rate risks through refinancing and other means when interest rates drastically fluctuate.
(ii) Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The impact of a 1% increase in interest rates for each fiscal year on profit before tax of the Group is as
follows.
In this analysis, calculation is made by multiplying balances of financial instruments with variable
interest rates held by the Group as of the end of each fiscal year by 1%, assuming that all other variables
are constant.

(i) Risk management of price fluctuations in equity instruments
The Group is exposed to risk of stock price fluctuations in equity instruments. The Group has no equity
instruments held for short-term trading but owns equity instruments to execute business strategies
smoothly. With regard to equity instruments, the Group regularly assesses fair value and monitors
issuers’ financial conditions.

income that were disposed (derecognized) is ¥486 million, and there is no such dividend income in
FY2021.
(6) Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk that causes financial loss to the Group when a counterparty of a financial asset held
by the Group goes into default for contractual obligations. According to its credit management policy, the
Group’s sales department and accounting and finance department regularly monitor the credit status of
each counterparty to claims such as trade receivables, manage due dates and balances, and strive for early
identification and mitigation of any concerns about collections due to deterioration in the financial position
of the counterparty and other factors. When full or partial collection of trade receivables and other is
considered impossible, or extremely difficult, it is deemed as a default.
The Group recognizes that there is little credit risk in the use of derivatives since the Group only deals with
financial institutions with high credit ratings to mitigate credit risk.
The Group does not have any credit risk significantly concentrated in a specific counterparty or a group to
which the counterparty belongs.

－63－(8) Fair value of financial instruments
The details of fair value of financial instruments are as follows. If financial instruments are settled in a
short term and their carrying amount approximates to their fair value, information on fair value of the
financial instruments is omitted.
Fair value hierarchy
The fair value hierarchy classifies the inputs as follows:
Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted market prices of identical assets or liabilities in active
markets
Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable inputs for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly
Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability
Transfers between fair value hierarchy levels are recognized on the date the event or condition
prompting the transfer occurred.

The fair value calculation methods are as follows:
Securities
The fair value of securities is calculated based on the quoted price at the securities exchange.
Borrowings
The fair value of borrowings with floating interest rates reflects market interest rates in a short term, and
the carrying amount and fair value are reasonable approximations. The fair value of borrowings with
fixed interest rates is calculated by the method in which future cash flows are discounted, using an
interest rate to which approximates when funds are borrowed under the same terms and conditions with
the same remaining borrowing period.

The fair value calculation methods are as follows:
Forward exchange contracts and others
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and others is calculated based on the market price of
forward exchange contracts and others entered into on similar terms and conditions.
Interest rate swaps
Interest rate swaps are used for the purpose of reducing interest borne on borrowings, and their fair value
is calculated based on the present value, which is derived by discounting future cash flows at the interest
rate reflecting the period up to the maturity date and credit risk.
Currency swaps
Currency swaps are used for the purpose of reducing foreign currency risks on currencies of borrowings,
and their fair value is calculated based on the present value, which is derived by discounting future cash
flows at the interest rate reflecting the period up to the maturity date and credit risk.
Call options
The fair value of call options is calculated based on the Black-Scholes model.

－66－(iv) Valuation techniques and inputs for financial instruments classified as Level 2 and Level 3
(a) Valuation techniques and inputs
Equity instruments
The fair value of equity instruments is measured using a valuation technique appropriate to
characteristics of the instrument, such as the comparable company analysis method and the option
pricing method.
In the measurement, input information, including stock price index of comparable companies, the
discount rate according to risk of the instrument, and price of conversion of preference shares held by
the Group into ordinary shares, is taken into account.
Debt instruments
The fair value of bonds and other instruments is calculated based on cash flows and business models.
Derivatives
The information is provided in “(ii) Fair value of derivatives.”
Contingent consideration
Contingent considerations classified as Level 3 are liabilities recognized as a result of recognizing a
part of the considerations as contingent considerations in the acquisition of shares, such as shares of
Neurovance, Inc. and shares of ReCor Medical Inc. Valuation techniques and inputs of fair value are
provided in Note “36. Business Combinations.”
(b) Valuation processes
The fair value of Level 3 financial instruments is measured based on internal regulations.
The Group has adopted appropriate valuation techniques and inputs that reflect the risks,
characteristics and nature of the financial instruments subject to valuation.

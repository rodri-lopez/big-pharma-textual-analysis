- 8 -Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Reporting Entity
Otsuka Holdings Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) is a company incorporated in
Japan. The addresses of its registered head office and principal business offices are disclosed on the
Company’s website (URL http://www.otsuka.com/en/). The consolidated financial statements of the Company,
which were prepared with the end of the fiscal year on December 31, 2016, comprise the Company and its
subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Group”) and interests in its associates.
The details of businesses and principal business activities of the Group are stated in “5. Operating Segments.”
2. Basis of Preparation
(1) Compliance with IFRS and first-time adoption
Pursuant to the provision of Article 93 of the Ordinance on Consolidated Financial Statements, the
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in compliance with IFRS since the
Company qualifies as a “Specified Company under Designated International Accounting Standards”
prescribed in Article 1-2 of the Ordinance.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 were
approved on March 29, 2017 by Tatsuo Higuchi, President and Representative Director, and Atsumasa
Makise, Senior Managing Director in charge of Corporate Finance.
The Group has adopted IFRS for the first time in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and the date of
transition to IFRS (hereinafter referred to as the “IFRS Transition Date”) is January 1, 2015. The impact
of the transition to IFRS on financial position, operating results and cash flows of the Group on the IFRS
Transition Date and in the comparative year is provided in “43. First-Time Adoption of IFRS.”
Except for IFRS that have not been early adopted and exemptions permitted under IFRS 1 “First-time
Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” (hereinafter referred to as “IFRS 1”), the
Group’s accounting policies are in accordance with IFRS effective as of December 31, 2016.
The exemptions adopted and reconciliations required to be disclosed under IFRS are provided in “43.
First-Time Adoption of IFRS.”
(2) Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for financial
instruments, etc. measured at fair value.
(3) Functional currency and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Japanese yen, which is the Company’s functional
currency, and figures are rounded down to the nearest million yen.
(4) Early adoption of new accounting standards
The Group has early adopted IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” (amended in July 2014) from the IFRS
Transition Date (January 1, 2015).
(5) New standards not yet adopted
Major standards and interpretations newly established or amended that have not been early adopted by the
Group are as follows.
The impact of adoption of these standards and interpretations on the Group is under consideration and
cannot be estimated at this point.

- 9 -3. Significant Accounting Policies
(1) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when the
Group has power over the investee, is exposed or has rights to variable returns arising from the Group’s
involvement in the investee and has an ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the
date that the Group gains control until the date that control is lost.
If any accounting policies applied by a subsidiary differ from those applied by the Group, adjustments
are made to the subsidiary’s financial statements where needed. The balances of payables and
receivables and internal transactions within the group companies as well as unrealized gains or losses
arising from internal transactions are offset in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
When the ownership interest in a subsidiary is partially disposed of, the transaction is accounted for as
an equity transaction if the Group retains control over the subsidiary. Any difference between the
amount of adjustment to the non-controlling interests and the fair value of the consideration paid or
received is recognized directly in equity attributable to owners of the Company.
If the Group loses control over the subsidiary, gains or losses derived from such loss are recognized as
profit or loss.
(ii) Associates
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence in terms of financial and
operating policies but which the Group does not control or jointly control. The Group is presumed to
have significant influence over another entity when it holds at least 20% but 50% or less of the voting
rights of the entity.
Investments in associates are recognized at cost at the time of acquisition and subsequently accounted
for using the equity method. Goodwill recognized on acquisition is included in investments in
associates. Because such goodwill is not separately recognized, it is not tested for impairment
separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investments in associates is tested for impairment as a
single asset whenever objective evidence indicates that the investments in associates may be impaired.
If any accounting policies applied by an associate differ from those applied by the Group, adjustments
are made to the associate’s financial statements where needed.
When the Group has retained interests after losing significant influence, these interests are measured at
fair value and any difference between the fair value and the carrying amount of the investment as of the
date on which the equity method was discontinued is recognized as profit or loss.
(2) Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of non-
controlling interests in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held
equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed. In case the identifiable net asset exceeds the aggregate of the
consideration and others, such excess is immediately recognized in profit or loss.
The consideration transferred is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets
transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the
equity interests issued by the acquirer. The consideration transferred includes any assets or liabilities
resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. The amount of non-controlling interests in the
acquiree is measured for each business combination either at fair value or as the present ownership
instruments’ proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date are measured at their fair values
as of the acquisition date, except for limited exceptions based on the requirements of IFRS 3 “Business
Combinations.”
Transaction costs incurred in relation to business combinations are recognized as expenses when they are
incurred.
If the initial accounting for business combinations is incomplete by the end of the fiscal year in which the
business combinations occur, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the
accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date are retrospectively
adjusted to reflect new information obtained during the measurement period about facts and
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and, if known at the acquisition date, would have
affected the measurement of the amounts recognized. Additional assets or liabilities are recognized if new
information is known to have resulted in the additional recognition of assets or liabilities. The
measurement period does not exceed one year.
- 10 -The Group has adopted the exemptions of IFRS 1 and did not apply IFRS 3 “Business Combinations”
retrospectively to business combinations that occurred before the IFRS Transition Date (January 1, 2015).
(3) Foreign currency translation
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Foreign currency transactions are translated to the respective functional currencies of the group
companies at exchange rates on the transaction dates or exchange rates which are close to the actual
rate on the transaction dates. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated to the
functional currency at the closing rate. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are
measured at fair value are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of
measurement.
Translation differences arising from translations or settlements are recognized as profit or loss;
provided, however, that translation differences arising from financial assets measured through other
comprehensive income as well as from cash flow hedges are recognized as other comprehensive
income.
(ii) Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Japanese yen at the closing rate. The
revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Japanese yen at the average exchange
rate for the reporting period. Translation differences arising from translation of financial statements of
foreign operations are recognized as other comprehensive income. Foreign currency translation reserve
are recognized as profit or loss for the period in which the foreign operations concerned are disposed.
The Group has adopted the exemption of IFRS 1 and accordingly the cumulative amount of foreign
currency translation reserve at the IFRS Transition Date (January 1, 2015) is deemed to be zero and the
entire amount has been reclassified to retained earnings.
(4) Financial instruments
(i) Financial assets
i) Initial recognition and measurement
Trade and other receivables are initially recognized on the date when they are incurred. All other
financial assets are initially recognized on the contract date when the Group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the financial instruments.
At the initial recognition, all financial assets, except for those measured at fair value through profit
or loss, are measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the financial
asset. Transaction costs of financial assets measured through profit or loss are recognized in profit
or loss.
At the initial recognition, financial assets are classified as (a) Financial assets measured at
amortized cost, (b) Debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income,
(c) Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or (d) Financial
assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.
(a) Financial assets measured at amortized cost
Financial assets are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost if both of the
following conditions are met.
 The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial
assets in order to collect contractual cash flows.
 The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
(b) Debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Financial assets are classified as debt instruments measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income if both of the following conditions are met.
 The financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both
collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.
 The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
(c) Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
For investments in some equity instruments, the Group has chosen an irrevocable option to
present subsequent changes in the fair value of investments that are neither held for trading nor
contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination to which IFRS 3
“Business Combinations” applies in other comprehensive income, and classifies such
investments as equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.
- 11 -(d) Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets, except for financial assets measured at amortized cost, debt instruments
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and equity instruments measured
at fair value through other comprehensive income stated above, are classified as financial assets
measured at fair value through profit or loss.
ii) Subsequent measurement
After the initial recognition, financial assets are measured according to their classification as
follows:
(a) Financial assets measured at amortized cost
Financial assets measured at amortized cost are measured at amortized cost using the effective
interest method. Amortization using the effective interest method and gains or losses arising in
the case of derecognition are recognized in profit or loss.
(b) Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured
at fair value. Any changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income. When
such financial assets are derecognized, the accumulated other comprehensive income is
transferred to retained earnings. Meanwhile, dividends from such financial assets are
recognized as profit or loss.
(c) Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and
any changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss.
iii) Impairment
With respect to impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost, the Group recognizes an
allowance for expected credit losses on such financial assets.
At the end of each fiscal year, the Group evaluates whether the credit risk on financial instruments
has increased significantly since the initial recognition.
If credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since the initial recognition,
the allowance for such financial instrument is measured at an amount equal to the 12-month
expected credit losses. If credit risk on a financial instrument has increased significantly since the
initial recognition, the allowance for such financial instrument is measured at an amount equal to
the lifetime expected credit losses.
The Group considers, as a general rule, that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when
payments have not been made and more than 30 days have passed since the contractual due date.
The assessment of whether or not credit risk has increased significantly takes into account
information that is reasonably available to the Group and supportable as well as past due
information.
When the credit risk on a financial asset is considered low at the end of fiscal year, the Group
determines that the credit risk on the financial asset has not increased significantly since initial
recognition.
However, with regards to trade receivables, etc., that do not contain a significant financing
component, the allowance is always measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit
losses, regardless of whether or not there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial
recognition.
Expected credit losses of a financial instrument are measured in a way that reflects the following
items:
 Unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible
outcomes;
 Time value of money; and
 Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the
reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.
The amounts of these measurements are recognized in profit or loss. The amount of expected credit
losses (or reversal) required to adjust the loss allowance at the end of fiscal year to the amount that
is required to be recognized is recognized in profit or loss, as impairment gains or impairment
losses.
iv) Derecognition
The Group derecognizes financial assets only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from
the financial assets expire, or when the Group transfers financial assets and substantially all the
risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets.
- 12 -(ii) Financial liabilities
i) Initial recognition and measurement
Bonds and borrowings are initially recognized on the date when they are issued or incurred. All
other financial liabilities are initially recognized on the contract date when the Group becomes a
party to the contractual provisions of the financial instruments.
At the initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as (a) financial liabilities measured at
amortized cost and (b) financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss.
At the initial recognition, financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are measured at fair value
net of transaction costs that are directly attributable to the financial liability. Transaction costs of
financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in profit or loss.
ii) Subsequent measurement
After the initial recognition, financial liabilities are measured according to their classification as
follows:
(a) Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest method. Amortization using the effective interest method and gains or losses
arising in the case of derecognition are recognized in profit or loss.
(b) Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and
any changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss.
iii) Derecognition
The Group derecognizes the financial liability when a financial liability is extinguished, that is, the
obligations specified in a contract are discharged, cancelled or expired.
(iii) Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented only when the Group
currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amount and intends either to settle on
a net basis or realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
(iv) Derivatives and hedge accounting
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value. After the initial recognition, derivatives are measured
at fair value.
The Group utilizes forward exchange contracts, currency swap agreements, currency option
transactions, interest rate swap agreements and other derivatives to hedge foreign currency risk and
interest rate risk.
At the inception of a hedging relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedging
relationship and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The
documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk
being hedged, and the methods of assessing whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge
effectiveness requirements. In addition, the Group assesses whether the hedging relationship meets the
hedge effectiveness requirements, both at the inception and on an ongoing basis. Ongoing assessments
are performed at each reporting date or upon a significant change in the circumstances affecting the
hedge effectiveness requirements, whichever comes first.
The Group applies hedge accounting to cash flow hedges which meet the criteria for hedge accounting
and such hedges are accounted for as follows:
The portions of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that are determined to be effective hedges
are recognized in other comprehensive income, while the remaining ineffective portions are recognized
in profit or loss. The amounts associated with the hedging instruments recognized in other
comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged transactions affect profit or
loss. However, in cases where the hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of
a non-financial asset or liability, the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is accounted
for as an adjustment to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
When the hedging relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria, or the hedging instrument expires
or is sold, terminated or exercised, the application of hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
When forecast transactions or firm commitments are no longer expected to occur, any related
cumulative gains or losses that have been recognized in equity through other comprehensive income
are reclassified to profit or loss.
The Group does not undertake any fair value hedges and any hedges of net investment in foreign
operations.
- 13 -(5) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term investments with
repayment terms of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible to cash
and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
(6) Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated
costs necessary to make the sale. The cost of inventories is determined mainly by using the weighted-
average cost formula. The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and
other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition.
(7) Property, plant and equipment
The cost model is applied in measurement of property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and
equipment are carried at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The cost of property, plant and equipment includes cost directly incidental to the acquisition of assets, and
the initial estimated costs of dismantling and removing the assets and restoration costs.
Depreciation expense for assets except for land and construction in progress is recognized mainly by the
straight-line method over the respective estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of major asset
items are as follows:
 Buildings and structures: 2 to 65 years
 Machinery and vehicles: 2 to 58 years
 Tools, furniture and fixtures: 2 to 30 years
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods of assets are reviewed at the end of
each fiscal year, and any changes are applied prospectively as a change in an accounting estimate.
(8) Goodwill
Measurement of goodwill at the initial recognition is stated in “(2) Business combinations.” After the
initial recognition, goodwill is recorded at its cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to each of the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units (hereinafter
referred to as the “Cash-Generating Units”) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business
combination. Cash-Generating Units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment
annually and whenever there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of
Cash-Generating Units is less than their carrying amounts, an impairment loss is recognized in profit or
loss.
With regard to allocation of impairment losses recognized in association with Cash-Generating Units, first
the carrying amount of goodwill that has been allocated to the unit is reduced, and then the remaining
amount of impairment loss is allocated to other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying
amount of each asset in the unit. For impairment losses recognized on goodwill, no reversal is made in
subsequent periods.
(9) Intangible assets
The cost model is applied in measurement of intangible assets. Intangible assets are carried at cost less
any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.
Separately acquired intangible assets are measured at cost at the time of the initial recognition.
Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
Internally generated intangible assets, other than development expenses that meet the requirements for
capitalization, are recognized as an expense when incurred.
Amortization expense on each intangible asset with a finite useful life is recognized by the straight-line
method over its estimated useful life. The estimated useful lives of major intangible assets are as follows:
 Patents: 5 to 10 years
 Trademarks, distribution rights and others: 3 to 16 years
 Software: 2 to 10 years
The estimated useful lives, residual values and amortization methods are reviewed at the end of each
fiscal year, and any changes are applied prospectively as a change in an accounting estimate.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives consist mainly of brands and trademarks acquired separately
or in business combinations, and are included in intangible assets as trademarks, distribution rights and
others. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed at the end of each fiscal year to
determine whether the indefinite useful life assessment remains appropriate. If it is no longer appropriate,
the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is accounted for as a change in an
accounting estimate.
- 14 -In-process research and development acquired separately or in business combinations are included in
intangible assets as in-process research and development. Because these assets are intangible assets that
are not yet available for use, they are not amortized and are tested for impairment. An asset in in-process
research and development is transferred to trademarks, distribution rights and others when the asset
becomes available for use by obtaining permits and approvals from regulatory authorities in a subsequent
period, and begins to be amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life from that
time.
(10) Leases
Lease transactions in which substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are transferred
to the Group are classified as finance leases. All other lease transactions are classified as operating leases.
With regards to finance leases, the Group initially recognizes lease assets and liabilities at the fair value of
the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the
inception of the lease.
Leased assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives or lease
terms, whichever is shorter. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance costs and the
repayments of the lease obligations. Finance costs are allocated to each period during the lease term so as
to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Lease payments under operating leases are recognized as expenses using the straight-line method over the
lease term.
(11) Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
The Group assesses whether there is any indication of impairment at the end of each fiscal year for
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount
of the asset is estimated. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset,
the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. A
cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. For the intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives, or those not yet available for use, the recoverable amounts are estimated at the end
of each fiscal year, regardless of whether there is any indication of impairment.
The recoverable amount of an individual asset or a cash-generating unit is measured at the higher of its
fair value less cost of disposal or its value in use. The value in use is calculated by discounting the
estimated future cash flows to the present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset.
The corporate assets do not independently generate cash inflows. When there is an indication of
impairment of the corporate assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the
corporate assets belong is calculated.
Impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss when the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating
unit exceeds the recoverable amount.
For an impairment loss recognized in prior periods, the Group assesses whether there is any indication of
a decrease or disappearance of the impairment loss at the end of each fiscal year. If there is any indication
of reversal of impairment loss, the recoverable amounts of assets or cash-generating units are estimated.
In cases in which the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit,
the impairment loss is reversed up to the lower of the recoverable amount or the carrying amount less any
depreciation and amortization costs that would have been determined had no impairment loss been
recognized.
(12) Assets held for sale
Assets or groups of assets expected to be recovered not by continuous use but by sale are classified as
non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale when they are quite likely to be sold within one year,
they are available for immediate sale in its present condition, and management of the Group is committed
to such sale. In such case, non-current assets are neither depreciated nor amortized, and are measured at
carrying amount or fair value less cost of sales, whichever is lower.
(13) Post-employment benefits
The Group’s post-employment benefit plans for its employees include defined benefit plans and defined
contribution plans.
The Group uses the projected unit credit method to determine the present value of the defined benefit
obligations, the related current service cost and the past service cost.
The discount rate is determined based on the market yield on high quality corporate bonds at the end of
fiscal year that are consistent with the discount period, which is set for the projected period until the
expected date of benefit payment in each fiscal year.
- 15 -Net defined benefit liabilities or assets are calculated by deducting the fair value of the plan assets from
the present value of the defined benefit obligations. If the defined benefit plan has surplus, the defined
benefit asset is limited to the asset ceiling that is the present value of any future economic benefits
available in the form of reductions in the future contributions to the plan or cash refunds.
Service costs and net interest on the net defined benefit liabilities (assets) are recognized in profit or loss.
The remeasured amount of a defined benefit plan is recognized at once in other comprehensive income
when it occurs, and immediately transferred to retained earnings.
Contributions to the defined contribution retirement benefits are recognized as expenses when employees
have rendered service.
(14) Provisions
Provisions are recognized when there are present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past
events, it is probable that outflows of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligations, and reliable estimates can be made of the amount of obligations.
The amount recognized as provisions is the best estimate taking into account the risks and uncertainties of
the expenditure required to settle the present obligations on the reporting date. When the time value of
money is material, the amount of provision is measured at the present value of the expenditures expected
to be required to settle the obligation.
(15) Treasury shares
Treasury shares are measured at acquisition cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognized
associated with the purchase, sale or retirement of treasury shares of the Company. Any difference
between the carrying amount and the consideration received from the sale is recognized as capital surplus.
(16) Share-based payments
(i) Equity-settled share-based payment plan
The Group has adopted a stock option plan accounted for as an equity-settled share-based payment plan.
Stock options are measured at fair value at the grant date and recognized as expenses over the vesting
periods with corresponding increases to equity, taking into account the estimated number of options to
be vested. The fair value of stock options granted is measured using the Black-Scholes model at the
grant date.
(ii) Cash-settled share-based payment plan
The Group has adopted equity-linked compensation entitlements as a cash-settled share-based payment
plan.
For the cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of payments is recognized as a liability, and
any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as profit or loss until the liability is settled.
(17) Net sales
(i) Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the Group has transferred to the buyer the
significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods, the Group retains neither continuous
managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the
goods sold, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is highly probable that the economic
benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group, and the costs incurred or to be incurred
in respect to the transaction can be measured reliably.
Such revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable taking into
account the amount of any trade discounts, volume rebates and others.
(ii) License and royalty income
License income is income from up-front and milestone payments received under license agreements,
etc. on development and distribution rights and others of products under development or finished
products, which the Group has concluded with a third party. License income is recognized when
contractual obligations are fulfilled. If not all contractual obligations have been fulfilled, such income
is recorded in liabilities, and revenue is recognized over the contract term, etc.
Royalty income is recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant
agreement.
(18) Government grants
Grant income is measured at fair value and recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the Group
will comply with the conditions attached to the grants and that the grants will be received. Grants for
revenue incurred are recorded as revenue in the fiscal year during which the expenses occurred. Grants for
the assets are recorded as revenue regularly over the useful life of the asset, and unearned grant income is
recorded as liability.
- 16 -(19) Finance income and finance costs
Finance income principally consists of interest income, dividend income, gain on fair value valuation and
foreign exchange gains. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method when the
income arises. Dividend income is recognized when the Group’s right to receive the dividend is
established.
Finance costs principally consist of interest expenses, loss on fair value valuation and foreign exchange
losses.
(20) Income taxes
Income taxes consist of current taxes and deferred taxes. These taxes are recognized in profit or loss,
except for those related to business combinations and items recognized directly in equity or other
comprehensive income.
Current taxes are measured at the amount of expected tax payment to or expected tax refund from tax
authorities. The amount of taxes is computed in accordance with tax rates and tax laws that are in effect or
substantially in effect by the end of the fiscal year in countries where the Group conducts business
activities and earns taxable profits or losses.
Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between accounting carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities at the reporting date and amounts of them for tax purposes, unused tax losses and unused
tax credits.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recorded for the following temporary differences:
 Temporary differences arising from goodwill
 Temporary differences arising from initial recognition of assets and liabilities which occur through
transactions that affect neither accounting profit nor taxable profit for tax purposes, except for business
combinations
 In cases where, for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and
associates, timing of reversal can be controlled and it is highly probable that such temporary
differences are not reversed in a foreseeable period
 In cases where, for deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and
associates, it is highly probable that such temporary differences are not reversed to the extent
foreseeable
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized, in principle, for all taxable temporary differences, while deferred
tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is highly probable
that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences could be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed in every period, and reduced by the amount of
deferred tax assets for which taxable profit sufficient to use all or part of the deferred tax assets is unlikely
to be earned. Unrecognized deferred tax assets are reassessed in every period and recognized to the extent
that it is highly probable that deferred tax assets are realizable with future taxable profit.
In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the Company and certain domestic subsidiaries applied for
approval of the adoption of the consolidated taxation system and it is to be adopted from the following
fiscal year. Therefore, from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
accounted for assuming the adoption of the consolidated taxation system.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated in accordance with tax rates and tax laws expected to be
applied in the period in which the assets are realized or the liabilities are settled based on tax rates and tax
laws that are in effect or substantially in effect at the end of the fiscal year.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current
tax assets against current tax liabilities, and they are related to income taxes levied by the same taxation
authority on the same taxable entity.
(21) Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary
equity holders of the Company, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares issued during the
period that is adjusted by the number of treasury shares. Diluted earnings per share are calculated
reflecting the adjustment of the impact from all diluted shares with dilutive effect.
4. Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgments
In preparing IFRS-compliant consolidated financial statements, the management is required to make
judgments, estimates and assumptions that may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Such estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The effects of the review of
accounting estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the review was conducted and future
accounting periods.
- 17 -Of items for which the management made estimates and judgments, those that have significant effects on the
amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements are as follows:
 Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (items (7) and (9) of “3. Significant
Accounting Policies,” “12. Property, Plant and Equipment” and “13. Goodwill and Intangible Assets”)
 Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets (items (8) and (11) of “3.
Significant Accounting Policies” and “14. Impairment of Assets”)
 Fair value measurement of the financial instruments (“34. Financial Instruments”)
 Recoverability of deferred tax assets (“16. Income Taxes”)
 Measurements of defined benefit obligations (“23. Post-employment Benefits”)
 Contingent liabilities (“41. Contingent Liabilities”)
5. Operating Segments
(1) Overview of reportable segments
The Group’s reportable segments are the constituent units of the Group for which separate financial
information is available and which are subject to periodic reviews by the Board of Directors in order to
make decisions on allocation of business resources and to evaluate the business performances of the
respective segments.

- 25 -14. Impairment of Assets
(1) Impairment loss
In calculating impairment losses, the Group bases its grouping of assets on the smallest identifiable group
of assets that generates largely independent cash inflows.
Impairment losses on in-process research and development are recorded in “Research and development
expenses” in the consolidated statement of income, and other impairment losses are included in “Selling,
general and administrative expenses.” In addition, reversal of impairment loss is recorded in “Selling,
general and administrative expenses.”
The breakdown of impairment loss and reversal of impairment loss by segment is as follows.
(Millions of yen)
FY2015 FY2016
(From January 1, 2015 (From January 1, 2016
to December 31, 2015) to December 31, 2016)

Corporate 30 (417)
Total 22,064 32,133
Corporate for FY2016 includes reversal of impairment loss of ¥423 million.
Pharmaceuticals
Impairment loss of ¥17,749 million in the pharmaceuticals business recognized in FY2015 consists of
impairment loss on property, plant and equipment of ¥418 million, impairment loss on goodwill of ¥5,904
million, and impairment loss on intangible assets of ¥11,426 million.
Impairment loss on property, plant and equipment of ¥418 million is principally a reduction of the
carrying amount of buildings and structures and tools, furniture and fixtures to the recoverable amount,
which is value in use, due to a decrease in the profitability.
Impairment loss on goodwill of ¥5,904 million is principally a reduction of the carrying amount of the
goodwill of ¥3,335 million to the recoverable amount of zero because as a result of review of the business
plan for Claris Otsuka Private Limited, the initially assumed profitability was no longer expected.
Impairment loss on intangible assets of ¥11,426 million is principally a reduction of the carrying amount
of trademarks, distribution rights and others and intangible assets (other) of ¥6,530 million to the
recoverable amount of zero because as a result of review of the business plan for Claris Otsuka Private
Limited, the initially assumed profitability was no longer expected.
Impairment loss of ¥21,051 million in the pharmaceuticals business recognized in FY2016 consists of
impairment loss on property, plant and equipment of ¥559 million and impairment loss on intangible
assets of ¥20,491 million.
Impairment loss on property, plant and equipment of ¥559 million is principally a reduction of the
carrying amount of buildings and structures and tools, furniture and fixtures to the recoverable amount,
which is value in use, due to a decrease in the profitability.
Impairment loss on intangible assets of ¥20,491 million is principally a reduction of the carrying amount
of in-process research and development of ¥14,305 million to the recoverable amount of zero because the
primary endpoints could not be achieved in the Phase III trial for the development code: Lu AE58054
(generic name: idalopirdine), which is under development by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. in
collaboration with H. Lundbeck A/S.
Nutraceuticals
Impairment loss of ¥5,986 million in the nutraceuticals business recognized in FY2016 consists of
impairment loss on property, plant and equipment of ¥1,710 million, impairment loss on goodwill of
¥2,947 million, and impairment loss on intangible assets of ¥1,328 million.
Impairment loss on property, plant and equipment of ¥1,710 million is principally a reduction of the
carrying amount of buildings and structures and machinery and vehicles to the recoverable amount, which
is value in use, due to a decrease in the profitability.
Impairment loss on goodwill of ¥2,947 million is a reduction of the carrying amount of the goodwill to the
recoverable amount, which is value in use, due to a decrease in the profitability.
- 26 -Impairment loss on intangible assets of ¥1,328 million is principally a reduction of the carrying amount of
trademarks, distribution rights and others to the recoverable amount, which is value in use, due to a
decrease in the profitability.
(2) Impairment test of goodwill
Goodwill arising in business combinations is allocated to cash-generating units that benefit from the
business combination on the acquisition date. The breakdown of the carrying amount of goodwill by
segment is as follows.
(Millions of yen)
IFRS Transition Date FY2015 FY2016
(As of January 1, 2015) (As of December 31, 2015) (As of December 31, 2016)
Pharmaceuticals 43,445 201,675 194,825
Nutraceuticals 38,244 36,452 31,235
Consumer products 520 520 503
Others 10,098 6,094 5,274
Total 92,308 244,743 231,839
Of the above, the carrying amount of significant goodwill in FY2016 is Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(pharmaceuticals) of ¥158,564 million (FY2015: ¥164,172 million), Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(pharmaceuticals) of ¥32,856 million (IFRS Transition Date: ¥34,001 million, FY2015: ¥34,018 million),
and Nutrition & Santé SAS (nutraceuticals) of ¥23,711 million (IFRS Transition Date: ¥30,164 million,
FY2015: ¥28,356 million).
The Group tests goodwill for impairment in each fiscal period, or whenever there is an indication of
impairment. The recoverable amount in impairment test is determined based on value in use.
Value in use reflects past experience and external information, and is calculated by discounting the
estimated amount of cash flows based on the business plan for the next five years approved by the
management and the growth rate to the present value using the discount rate based on the pre-tax
weighted average cost of capital of the cash-generating unit (10.9 to 11.4%). The growth rate is
determined to be 0 to 2.0% in view of the long-term average growth rate in the industry or country to
which the cash-generating unit belongs, and does not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the
market.
There is the risk that impairment may arise when key assumptions used in the impairment test are changed.
However, the value in use adequately exceeds the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit, and it is
considered unlikely that the value in use falls below the carrying amount even if key assumptions used in
the impairment test change within a reasonably predictable range.
(3) Impairment test of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives included in trademark rights in FY2016 are principally brands
held by the Nutrition & Santé SAS Group (nutraceuticals), and their carrying amount is ¥22,056 million
(IFRS Transition Date: ¥24,744 million, FY2015: ¥24,575 million).
Each brand is tested for impairment in each fiscal period, or whenever there is an indication of impairment,
using the relief-from-royalty method and the excess earnings method. Value in use reflects past experience
and external information, and is determined using the business plan for the next five years approved by
the management and the discount rate equal to pre-tax weighted average cost of capital to which certain
country risk and foreign currency risk are added where necessary (6.5 to 14.0%). The growth rate is
determined to be 0 to 3.5% in view of the long-term average growth rate in the industry or country to
which the cash-generating unit belongs, and does not exceed the long-term average growth rate of the
market. The value in use adequately exceeds the carrying amount in each case, and it is considered
unlikely that the value in use falls below the carrying amount even if key assumptions used in the
impairment test change within a reasonably predictable range.
(4) Impairment test of in-process research and development
In-process research and development in FY2016 is principally rights related to research and development
of AVP-786, and their carrying amount is ¥166,347 million (FY2015: ¥172,231 million).
As intangible assets not yet available for use, in-process research and development is tested for
impairment in each fiscal period, or whenever there is an indication of impairment. The recoverable
amount in impairment test is determined based on value in use.
Value in use reflects past experience and external information, and is calculated by discounting the
estimated amount of cash flows based on the business plan for the next five years approved by the
management and the growth rate to the present value using the discount rate based on the pre-tax
weighted average cost of capital of the cash-generating unit (12.4% for AVP-786).

In recognizing deferred tax assets, the Group takes into account the possibility that part or all of
deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be used against future
taxable profit. In assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, reversal of deferred tax liabilities,
expected future taxable profit and tax planning are taken into account. Based on the level of taxable profit
in the past and estimated future taxable profit in the period during which deferred tax assets are deductible,
the Group considers it is probable that deferred taxable assets recognized as of December 31, 2016 will be
recovered.
- 29 -(2) Unrecognized deferred tax assets
Deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits for which no deferred tax asset
is recognized are as follows.

- 30 -(4) Income tax expenses
The effective tax rates for FY2015 (ended December 31, 2015) and FY2016 (ended December 31, 2016)
in Japan were approximately 35.6% and 33.0%, respectively. The tax amount in other tax jurisdictions is
calculated using a general tax rate in each jurisdiction. The breakdown of current tax expenses and
deferred tax expenses is as follows.
(Millions of yen)

In conjunction with the promulgation of the Act for Partial Amendment of the Income Tax Act, etc. (Act
No. 9 of 2015), and the Act for Partial Amendment of the Local Tax Act, etc. (Act No. 2 of 2015) on
March 31, 2015, the effective statutory tax rate used by the Company and its domestic subsidiaries has
been changed from 35.6% in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 to 33.0% in the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2016 and to 32.2% in the fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2017.
Furthermore, as the Act for Partial Amendment of the Income Tax Act, etc. (Act No. 15 of 2016), and the
Act for Partial Amendment of the Local Tax Act, etc. (Act No. 13 of 2016), were enacted in the Diet on
March 29, 2016, the effective statutory tax rate used by the Company and its domestic subsidiaries to
calculate the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities (however, limited to those that are reversed on
or after January 1, 2017) has been changed from 32.2% in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 to
30.8% for the temporary differences expected to be recovered or settled between January 1, 2017 and
December 31, 2018, and to 30.6% for those expected to be recovered or settled on or after January 1, 2019,
respectively.
The reconciliation of the effective statutory tax rate and the actual tax rate for each fiscal year is as
follows. The actual tax rate represents the ratio of income tax expenses to profit before taxes.

The Group has a policy to conduct a lease transaction only when the Group judged that the lease transaction
has more merits, comprehensively taking into account aversion of obsolescence risk, a reduction in related
expenses and other factors.
The weighted average interest rate on finance lease obligations was 4.07% for FY2015 (ended December 31,
2015) and 4.09% for FY2016 (ended December 31, 2016).
Some contracts include renewal options. There are no contingent rent payable, escalation clauses (clauses
specifying a raise in the lease contract amount) or restriction imposed by any lease contracts (such as
restriction on dividends, additional borrowings and additional leases).

The details of provisions are as follows.
(i) Provision for asset retirement obligations
The Group records provision for asset retirement obligations at the estimated amount of costs for removal
of harmful substances related to non-current assets and the estimated amount of restoration costs for
rented offices and others for which the Group has obligations to restore the site to its original condition at
the end of the lease contract.
The Group expects that the timing at which economic benefits flow out is principally after one year
passed from the end of each fiscal year.
(ii) Provision for restructuring
The Group records provision for restructuring at the estimated amount of expenditure occurring in line
with business reorganization. Provision for restructuring is recognized when the Group has a specific
official plan and makes those involved who are affected expect that the restructuring is certainly
implemented, through announcement or execution of the plan. Provision for restructuring only includes an
amount that is necessitated by the restructuring and not associated with the company’s continuing
activities.
The Group expects that the timing at which economic benefits flow out is principally within one year
from the end of each fiscal year.
- 34 -23. Post-employment Benefits
The Group has adopted defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans as post-employment benefit plans.
Major domestic subsidiaries have a contributory funded, defined benefit corporate pension plan and lump-sum
retirement payments plan as defined benefit plans, and defined contribution pension plans as defined
contribution plans.
Certain foreign subsidiaries have contributory funded or unfunded defined benefit plans, defined contribution
plans, or a combination of them.
Among defined benefit plans, the major plan is the defined benefit plan in Japan, which accounts for
approximately 90% of total defined benefit obligations.
There is no post-employment benefit other than pensions and lump-sum payments.
For the accounting policy for defined benefit plans, please refer to note “3. Significant Accounting Policies
(13) Post-employment benefits.”
(1) Defined benefit plans
For benefits under defined benefit plans of the Company and major domestic subsidiaries, the amount of
retirement benefit payments is calculated based on service years, salaries during the service period,
position and other factors. When the period of validity of a retiring employee equals to or more than a
certain period, benefits are paid as lump-sum payment or pension at the option of the employee. Upon
retirement, etc. of employees, additional retirement benefits that do not qualify as benefits under defined
benefit plans may be paid.
Defined benefit corporate pension plans are managed by Otsuka Pharmaceuticals corporate pension fund.
Directors of this pension fund and the pension plan management institution are required by laws and
regulations to behave in a way that gives utmost priority to the interest of plan participants and former
participants and assume the responsibility for managing plan assets under the prescribed policy.
Although defined benefit retirement benefit plans are exposed to general investment risk, interest rate risk
and others, it is considered that the exposure to these risks is not significant.

- 36 -Management policy for plan assets
The fund management policy for major plans of the Group aims to secure stable returns over the medium
to long term to ensure the payment of defined benefit obligations now and in the future. Specifically,
assets are managed by setting the target rate of return and the asset mix by investment asset within a range
of acceptable risk defined annually and maintaining this mix.
The Group conducts review of the asset mix where necessary, taking into account financial conditions of
defined benefit pension plans and the investment environment.
When management of each asset is implemented, the Group seeks efficiency on the investment aspect
through continuous monitoring with attention to risk diversification associated to asset managers.
The fair value of the plan assets is as follows.

Any economic benefit is not available because future contributions are not reduced or refunded.
Consequently an unrecognized surplus has arisen in some pension plans of the Group.
Principal actuarial assumptions at the end of the reporting period are as follows.
IFRS Transition Date FY2015 FY2016
(As of January 1, 2015) (As of December 31, 2015) (As of December 31, 2016)

The following table represents the sensitivity analysis for significant actuarial assumptions.
The sensitivity analysis shows impact of a 0.5% increase or decrease in assumptions used in actuarial
calculation on the present value of defined benefit obligations.
This analysis is based on the assumption that other variables are constant. The analysis for FY2016 (ended
December 31, 2016) was made using the same fundamentals as those for FY2015 (ended December 31,
2015).

The put options written on shares of foreign subsidiaries granted by the foreign subsidiaries to owners of
non-controlling interests are recognized at the present value of exercise price of options as financial
liabilities and the same amount is deducted from capital surplus at initial recognition, while any
subsequent change is recognized in profit or loss. As of January 1, 2015, December 31, 2015 and
December 31, 2016, the amount deducted from capital surplus was ¥9,802 million each.
The fair value of put options is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the fair value
after the initial recognition are recorded as finance income or costs. Valuation techniques and hierarchy of
fair value is provided in note “34. Financial Instruments.”

acquisition rights that ultimately become exercisable varies depending on the level of achievement of the medium-term
management plan and others. The number of share acquisition rights that ultimately become exercisable is determined by
multiplying the base number of share acquisition rights, which is determined for the position of each eligible person in
consideration of the content of duties performed, responsibilities, base remuneration, etc., by a certain percentage.

based on an assumption that stock options are exercised at the midpoint of the exercise period.
3. The amount is based on actual dividends paid in the past 12 months (June 2015 and December 2015).
4. The risk-free interest rate represents the interest rate on Japanese government bonds with the remaining period
corresponding to the expected remaining option life.
- 45 -34. Financial Instruments
(1) Capital management
The Group’s basic policy for capital management is to improve capital efficiency and ensure financial
soundness in order to achieve sustainable growth and enhance corporate value over the medium to long
term.
The Group conducts monitoring of financial indicators as a procedure for capital management. The Group
monitors return on equity attributable to owners of the Company for capital efficiency and ratio of equity
attributable to owners of the Company to total assets for financial soundness in a timely manner.
The Group is not subject to any material capital restrictions.

(3) Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to financial risks (market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk) in the course of
operating activities and conducts risk management in accordance with certain policy to mitigate these
financial risks. The Group uses derivative transactions to avoid foreign currency risks or interest rate risks
and, in accordance with its policy, does not carry out any speculative transactions.
(4) Market risk management
The Group’s activities are mainly exposed to risks of changes in economic circumstances and financial
market circumstances. Specifically, the risks of changes in financial market circumstances include 1)
Foreign currency risk, 2) Interest rate risk, and 3) Risk of fluctuations in equity instrument prices.
1) Foreign currency risk
(i) Foreign currency risk management
The Group engages in business globally, and fluctuations in exchange rates of the US dollar and
Euro principally affect its operating results.
With regard to settlement of receivables and payables arising from ongoing operating activities,
the Group’s policy is to balance foreign exchange receipts and payments as much as possible with
three major currencies, namely the US dollar, Euro and Yen. More specifically, operating
subsidiaries that continuously engage in export and import transactions reduce the frequency of
exchanging foreign currencies by holding foreign currencies received as export proceeds without
- 46 -exchanging them for the local currency, and using them directly in payment for imports, in order
to mitigate foreign currency risks.
(ii) Foreign exchange sensitivity analysis
The Group is principally exposed to foreign currency risks of US dollar and Euro. The following
table shows the sensitivity analysis in the case where the yen’s value increases by 1% against the
US dollar and the Euro in each reporting period. In making these calculations, the Group has
assumed no changes in currencies other than those used. The impact from the translation of
functional currency-denominated financial instruments, and assets, liabilities, profit and expense
of foreign operations into yen is not included. This is based on the assumption that other variable
factors (such as balances and interest rate) are constant.

yen’s value increases by 1% against each currency. The above amounts show effects of currency translation on the Group’s
consolidated financial statements, and do not have direct positive or negative effects on its cash flows and business
management.
(iii) Forward exchange contracts and others
With regard to management of derivative transactions including forward exchange contracts, the
Group has established management rules for derivative transactions and limits derivative
transactions to those made for the purpose of hedging risks.
The Group may enter into forward exchange contracts and other agreements to fix future cash
flows related to lending and borrowing of funds within the Group in association with receivables
and payables denominated in foreign currencies or to determine the amount of dividends within
the Group. In this case, the Group also manages these contracts appropriately in accordance with
the internal rules.
The breakdown of forward exchange contracts and others is presented in “(8) Fair value of

2) Interest rate risk
(i) Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to various interest rate risks in its business activities, and fluctuations in
interest rates associated with borrowings especially affect its operating results. However, the
effect of interest rate fluctuations on borrowing costs is offset by income arising from assets that
are affected by the interest rate fluctuations.
The Group monitors fluctuations in interest rates arising from these assets and liabilities, and
manages interest rate risks through refinancing and other means when interest rates drastically
fluctuate.
(ii) Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The impact of a 1% increase in interest rates for each reporting period on profit before taxes of the
Group is as follows.
In this analysis, calculation is made by multiplying balances of financial instruments with variable
interest rates held by the Group as of the end of each reporting period by 1%, assuming that all
other variables are constant.

As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016, there were no significant financial instruments that
were offset in the consolidated statement of financial position. Among financial assets and financial
liabilities that were recognized for the same counterparty, there were also no significant financial
instruments that were under enforceable master netting arrangements or similar contracts but were not
offset as they did not meet certain or all criteria of offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities.
(6) Credit risk management
Credit risks are risks that result in financial losses incurred by the Group when a customer goes into
default for contractual obligations. The Group has the sales department and the accounting and finance
department monitor the status of business partners in terms of trade receivables, etc., regularly and
manage due dates and balances for each business partner while working to early identify and mitigate any
concerns about collections due to deterioration in each business partner’s financial position and other
factors. When full or partial collection of trade receivables, etc., is considered impossible, or extremely
difficult, it is deemed to be a default.
With regard to shares in securities and investment securities, financial conditions of issuers are assessed
regularly in accordance with management rules of each Group company. With regard to public and
corporate bonds, credit risks are insignificant because the Group invests only in highly rated bonds.
The Group recognizes that there is extremely insignificant credit risk in the use of derivatives since it only
deals with financial institutions with high credit ratings to mitigate credit risk.
The Group does not have any credit risk overly concentrated in a specific counterparty or a group to
which the counterparty belongs.
1) Allowance for credit losses
When financial assets are impaired, the Group does not reduce the impairment directly from the
carrying amount and accounts for the impairment in the allowance for credit losses account. Changes
in allowance for credit losses are as follows.

cash flow management plan, maintaining a constant level of liquidity at hand, and other means. A
temporary shortage of funds due to payment of dividends, bonuses and others is covered with loans from
banks and other financial institutions.

The calculation method for above fair values is as follows.
Bonds
The fair value of bonds is determined based on the quoted price at the stock exchange.
Bonds and borrowings
The fair value of bonds and borrowings with floating interest rates reflects market interest rates within
a short period of time, and the carrying amount reasonably approximates the fair value. The fair value
of those with fixed interest rates is determined by the method in which future cash flows are discounted
using the interest rate for the case where funds are borrowed under the same terms and conditions with
the same remaining period.
Lease obligations
The fair value of lease obligations is determined by the method in which future cash flows are
discounted using the interest rate for the case where leases are entered into under the same terms and
conditions with the same remaining period.

(Note) Transfers between fair value hierarchy levels are recognized on the date the event or condition prompting the transfer
occurred. In each fiscal year, there was no significant transfer between Level 1, 2 and 3.
(iv) Valuation techniques and inputs for financial instruments classified as Level 2 and Level 3
(a) Valuation techniques and inputs
Equity instruments
The fair values of equity instruments are measured using a valuation technique appropriate to
characteristics of the instrument, such as the comparable company analysis method and the option
pricing method.
In the measurement, input information, including stock price index of comparable companies, the
discount rate according to risk of the instrument, and price of conversion of preference shares held by
the Group into ordinary shares, is taken into account.
Loans receivable
The fair values of loans receivable are determined by the method where future cash flows are
discounted using the interest rate applicable when new loans are provided under the same terms and
conditions with the same remaining period, and other methods.
Derivatives
The information is provided in “34. Financial Instruments (8) Fair value of financial instruments (ii)
Fair value of derivatives.”
(b) Valuation processes
Fair values of Level 3 financial instruments are measured based on internal regulations.
The Group has adopted appropriate valuation techniques and inputs that reflect the risks, characteristics
and nature of the financial instruments subject to valuation.

profit or loss as of the reporting date. These gains or losses are included in finance income and finance costs in the
consolidated statement of income.
2. Gains or losses included in other comprehensive income relate to financial assets measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income as of the reporting date. These gains or losses are included in financial assets measured at fair
value through other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
(9) Transfer of financial assets
The Group discounts certain notes receivable for banks before the due date of the note and endorses
certain notes to suppliers, etc. Even if notes are discounted for banks or endorsed to suppliers, etc., the
Group is required to purchase the notes back from the bank for which the discount was made or the
supplier, etc. when the note was not honored. Therefore, discounted notes and endorsed notes continue to
be recognized as notes receivable until the due date of the note and included and presented in trade and
other receivables. Amounts received due to the endorsement or discount are presented as other financial
liabilities. Other financial liabilities related to discounted notes and endorsed notes, etc. (discounted notes,
etc.) as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016 are as follows.
Due to the exemption to the retrospective application upon first-time adoption under IFRS 1, requirements
for derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities are applied prospectively to transactions
occurring on and after the IFRS Transition Date. Consequently, such transferred assets are also
derecognized in accordance with Japanese GAAP on the IFRS Transition Date.

(i) Name of company acquired and nature of business
Name of company acquired: Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Nature of business: Research, development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products
(ii) Rationale for business combination
Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (hereinafter “Avanir”) is a biopharmaceutical venture company
specializing in the area of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. It was founded in 1988 in Southern
California and now employs approximately 500 people. Avanir developed and launched NUEDEXTA®
(dextromethorphan hydrobromide/quinidine sulfate) 20 mg/10 mg capsules in the U.S. in February
2011 as the world’s first and only approved treatment for the pseudobulbar affect (PBA). Avanir
markets NUEDEXTA in the U.S. through its own sales organization of over 300 sales representatives,
150 of whom are medical representatives hired to accelerate the continued growth of NUEDEXTA for
PBA. The company’s pipeline includes programs in Alzheimer-type dementia, Parkinson’s disease,
migraine, and other CNS indications. The promising new chemical entity AVP-786, with a target
indication for behavioral disorders (agitation) associated with Alzheimer-type dementia is being
prepared to enter Phase III clinical trials.
The acquisition of Avanir will bring Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (hereinafter “Otsuka
Pharmaceutical”) three distinct values: 1) NUEDEXTA, created to treat the under-recognized neurologic
disease PBA; 2) the late-stage investigational compound AVP-786 in clinical development to treat
agitation associated with Alzheimer-type dementia and; 3) Avanir’s clinical development and
commercial expertise in neurologic diseases, which complements Otsuka Pharmaceutical’s capabilities
- 60 -in psychiatric diseases. These will accelerate Otsuka Pharmaceutical’s existing expansion strategy in
the neurologic area, widening the overall CNS portfolio, inclusive of the psychiatric and neurologic
areas, supporting both short- and medium-term growth.
This acquisition is consistent with the Otsuka Group’s investment philosophy: invest in companies and
businesses with which we can share a common management philosophy, human resources, products
and technology to enhance corporate value; and invest with a long-term perspective. The acquisition is
based on Otsuka’s central concepts of creativity and proof through execution.

- 62 -42. Subsequent Events
Acquisition of Neurovance, Inc.
Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, agreed with US-based
Neurovance, Inc., which is engaged in research and development of pharmaceutical products, through an
acquisition company set up by Otsuka America, Inc. to have Neurovance, Inc. a wholly-owned company by
acquiring shares in exchange for payments of cash and future milestones and subsequently merging with the
company (hereinafter referred to as the “Acquisition”) on March 2, 2017 (US Eastern Standard Time) and
implemented the Acquisition as of March 17, 2017.
Overview of the Acquisition
(i) Name of company acquired and nature of business
Name of company acquired: Neurovance, Inc.
Nature of business: Research and development of pharmaceutical products
(ii) Rationale for the Acquisition
Neurovance, Inc., which was established as a spin-off from Euthymics Bioscience, Inc. (headquartered
in Cambridge, Massachusetts) in 2011, owns centanafadine (development code: EB-1020) that is under
development for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adult and pediatric
patients. Centanafadine is a triple reuptake inhibitor that modulates norepinephrine, serotonin and
dopamine reuptake. As a result of the phase IIb (P2b) clinical trial in ADHD adult patients in the US,
the ADHD assessment scale was significantly improved. Phase III trials are currently in preparation.
ADHD is a developmental disorder characterized by inattention (distractibility and memory loss) and
hyperactivity and impulsiveness (fidgeting and restlessness). Now, while psychostimulants are mostly
prescribed in the US, their central excitatory action, mental dependence property and drug resistance
are challenges and sometimes the abuse, etc. is considered problematic. As a medicine with comparable
efficacy to stimulant drugs, comparable tolerability to non-stimulant drugs and a potentially lower risk
of abuse is required, the launch of centanafadine with unique characteristics of triple reuptake inhibitor
onto the market is awaited.
The purpose of the Acquisition is to acquire new portfolio in the central nervous system area from
Neurovance, Inc. to further strengthen this area. The Company will continue research and development
of medicines with key focus placed on the areas of central nervous system, oncology and
cardiovascular and renal system to address unsolved medical needs.
(iii) Acquisition date
March 17, 2017
(iv) How the Group gained the control of the company acquired, and percentage of voting equity interest to
be acquired
An acquisition company of the Company acquired 100% of voting shares of Neurovance, Inc. in
exchange for payments of cash and future milestones.
(v) Consideration to be paid
In accordance with terms and conditions of the agreement, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. pays, to
existing shareholders of Neurovance, Inc., US $100 million as consideration for the Acquisition at the
time of completion of the Acquisition and up to US $150 million in additional payments contingent on
achievement of milestones for development of centanafadine (development code: EB-1020), which is
being developed by Neurovance, Inc. as treatment of ADHD. Furthermore, after the launch, payments
contingent on achievement of sales milestones are made.
(vi) Method of raising funds for the acquisition
The entity was acquired with own funds.

Notes on reconciliations
The main adjustments of differences are as follows:
A. Adjustments to property, plant and equipment
For some subsidiaries that were not consolidated or to which the equity method was applied
under Japanese GAAP, the scope of consolidation was reviewed under IFRS and they are
considered to be consolidated subsidiaries. Consequently, property, plant and equipment have
been capitalized.
Incidental costs such as import duties, acquisition taxes and professional fees for acquisition of
property, plant and equipment, which were recorded as expenses under Japanese GAAP, are
recognized and measured at the amount included in acquisition cost of the property, plant and
equipment under IFRS, and the adjustments are made to retained earnings.
B. Adjustments to goodwill and negative goodwill
Under Japanese GAAP, for some business combinations, allocation of acquisition cost was not
completed as of the transition date and goodwill was recognized and measured at the amount
calculated by the tentative accounting treatment based on reasonable information that was
available at that time; however, under IFRS, the finalization of the tentative accounting treatment
is retrospectively reflected as of the transition date, and the adjustments are mainly made to
intangible assets and retained earnings. In addition, under Japanese GAAP, goodwill of foreign
subsidiaries arising from business combinations conducted before April 1, 2010 was translated at
exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction; however, under IFRS, such goodwill is
translated at exchange rates prevailing at the time of closing of accounts. The adjustments are
made to other components of equity and immediately transferred to retained earnings.
Under Japanese GAAP, negative goodwill arising from business combinations conducted before
April 1, 2010 was recognized as liabilities at the date of the acquisition and amortized on a
straight-line basis; however, under IFRS, since such negative goodwill is recognized as a gain at
the date of the acquisition, the adjustments are made to retained earnings.
C. Adjustments to intangible assets
Under Japanese GAAP, expenditures for technology introduction contracts and others were
recognized as research and development expenses; however, under IFRS, such expenditures that
meet the definition of intangible assets under IAS 38 are capitalized, and the adjustments are
made to retained earnings.
Under Japanese GAAP, for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, amortization expenses
were recognized on a straight-line basis with the useful life deemed as 20 years; however, under
IFRS, because such assets are not amortized, the adjustments are made to retained earnings.
- 68 -D. Adjustments to other financial assets (non-current)
Under Japanese GAAP, for securities of which the market value significantly decreased,
impairment was recognized and acquisition cost was reduced; however, under IFRS, reduction
of acquisition cost due to impairment is not made. Under Japanese GAAP, unlisted shares were
mainly valued at cost using the moving average method, while under IFRS, such shares are
measured at fair value. The adjustments for the resulting differences are made to retained
earnings and other components of equity. Furthermore, for some subsidiaries that were not
consolidated under Japanese GAAP, the scope of consolidation was reviewed under IFRS and
they are considered to be consolidated subsidiaries. Consequently, elimination of investments
and recording of assets and liabilities are conducted and the adjustments for the resulting
differences are made to retained earnings.
E. Adjustments to other current liabilities
Unused paid absences, which are not required to be accounted for under Japanese GAAP, are
recognized in liabilities under IFRS and the adjustments are made to retained earnings.
F. Adjustments to other financial liabilities (non-current)
For put options written on shares of foreign subsidiaries granted by the foreign subsidiaries to
owners of non-controlling interests, which are not required to be accounted for under Japanese
GAAP, the present value of the option exercise price is recognized as financial liabilities under
IFRS, and the adjustments for the resulting differences are made to capital surplus and retained
earnings.
G. Adjustments to retirement benefits
Under Japanese GAAP, for actuarial gains or losses, the amount was amortized by the straight-
line method over a period within the average remaining service period (5 to 20 years) of eligible
employees at the time of occurrence, beginning from the next fiscal year of occurrence; however,
under IFRS, such actuarial gains or losses are recognized in other comprehensive income at the
time of occurrence and immediately transferred to retained earnings.
Under Japanese GAAP, past service cost is amortized starting in the fiscal year incurred using a
straight-line method over a certain period (5 to 23 years), but within the average remaining
service period of employees; however, under IFRS, past service cost is recognized in gains or
losses at the time of occurrence and immediately transferred to retained earnings.
Under IFRS, unlike Japanese GAAP, when a defined benefit plan is overfunded, the net defined
benefit asset is limited to the asset ceiling, and when there are minimum funding requirements
for past service, a reduction in assets or an increase in liabilities is made to the extent that
minimum funding contributions payable to the plan will not be available as either a refund or a
reduction in future contributions. Consequently, the adjustments are made to other
comprehensive income and immediately transferred to retained earnings.
Retirement benefit obligations are recalculated in accordance with provisions of IFRS, and the
adjustments are made to retained earnings.

The above adjustment to intangible assets includes ¥12,969 million of impairment losses on in-
process research and development and trademarks, distribution rights and others, which was
recognized for the first time on the IFRS Transition Date in the pharmaceuticals business. These
impairment losses occurred because the carrying amount was reduced to the recoverable amount,
which is value in use, due to a decrease in the profitability.

Notes on reconciliations
The main adjustments of differences are as follows:
A. Adjustments to property, plant and equipment
Incidental costs such as import duties, acquisition taxes and professional fees for acquisition of
property, plant and equipment, which were recorded as expenses under Japanese GAAP, are
recognized and measured at the amount included in acquisition cost of the property, plant and
equipment under IFRS, and the adjustments are made to retained earnings.
B. Adjustments to goodwill and negative goodwill
Under Japanese GAAP, for some business combinations, allocation of acquisition cost was not
completed as of the transition date and goodwill was recognized and measured at the amount
calculated by the tentative accounting treatment based on reasonable information that was
available at that time; however, under IFRS, the finalization of the tentative accounting treatment
is retrospectively reflected as of the transition date, and the adjustments are mainly made to
intangible assets and retained earnings. In addition, under Japanese GAAP, goodwill of foreign
subsidiaries arising from business combinations conducted before April 1, 2010 was translated at
exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction; however, under IFRS, such goodwill is
translated at exchange rates prevailing at the time of closing of accounts, and the adjustments are
made to other components of equity. Differences recognized as of the IFRS Transition Date are
transferred to retained earnings. Under Japanese GAAP, goodwill was amortized over the period
in which its effects were expected to occur; however, under IFRS, goodwill has not been
amortized since the transition date.
Under Japanese GAAP, negative goodwill arising from business combinations conducted before
April 1, 2010 was recognized as liabilities at the date of the acquisition and amortized on a
straight-line basis; however, under IFRS, since such negative goodwill is recognized as a gain at
the date of the acquisition, the adjustments are made to retained earnings.
C. Adjustments to intangible assets
Under Japanese GAAP, expenditures for technology introduction contracts and others were
recognized as research and development expenses; however, under IFRS, such expenditures that
meet the definition of intangible assets under IAS 38 are capitalized, and amortization expenses
and impairment losses arising after the commencement of amortization are recognized in selling,
general and administrative expenses.
Under Japanese GAAP, for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, amortization expenses
on intangible assets was recognized on a straight-line basis with the useful life deemed as 20
years; however, under IFRS, such assets are not amortized.
D. Adjustments to other current assets (non-current)
Under Japanese GAAP, for securities of which the market value significantly decreased,
impairment was recognized and acquisition cost was reduced; however, under IFRS, reduction
of acquisition cost due to impairment is not made. Under Japanese GAAP, unlisted shares were
mainly valued at cost using the moving average method, while under IFRS, such shares are
measured at fair value. The adjustments for the resulting differences are made to retained
earnings and other components of equity.
E. Adjustments to other current liabilities
Unused paid absences, which are not required to be accounted for under Japanese GAAP, are
recognized in liabilities under IFRS and the adjustments are made to retained earnings.
- 74 -F. Adjustments to other financial liabilities (non-current)
For put options written on shares of foreign subsidiaries granted by the foreign subsidiaries to
owners of non-controlling interests, which are not required to be accounted for under Japanese
GAAP, the present value of the option exercise price is recognized as financial liabilities under
IFRS, and the adjustments for the resulting differences are made to capital surplus and retained
earnings.
G. Adjustments to retirement benefits
Under Japanese GAAP, for actuarial gains or losses, the amount was amortized by the straight-
line method over a period within the average remaining service period (5 to 20 years) of eligible
employees at the time of occurrence, beginning from the next fiscal year of occurrence; however,
under IFRS, such actuarial gains or losses are recognized in other comprehensive income at the
time of occurrence and immediately transferred to retained earnings.
Under Japanese GAAP, past service cost is amortized starting in the fiscal year incurred using a
straight-line method over a certain period (5 to 23 years), but within the average remaining
service period of employees; however, under IFRS, past service cost is recognized in gains or
losses at the time of occurrence and immediately transferred to retained earnings.
Under IFRS, unlike Japanese GAAP, when a defined benefit plan is overfunded, the net defined
benefit asset is limited to the asset ceiling, and when there are minimum funding requirements
for past service, a reduction in assets or an increase in liabilities is made to the extent that
minimum funding contributions payable to the plan will not be available as either a refund or a
reduction in future contributions. Consequently, the adjustments are made to other
comprehensive income and immediately transferred to retained earnings.
Retirement benefit obligations are recalculated in accordance with provisions of IFRS, and the
adjustments are made to retained earnings.

J. Remeasurements of defined benefit plans
Under Japanese GAAP, for actuarial gains or losses, the amount was amortized by the straight-
line method over a period within the average remaining service period (5 to 20 years) of eligible
employees at the time of occurrence, beginning from the next fiscal year of occurrence; however,
under IFRS, such actuarial gains or losses are recognized in other comprehensive income at the
time of occurrence. Under IFRS, unlike Japanese GAAP, when a defined benefit plan is
overfunded, the net defined benefit asset is limited to the asset ceiling, and when there are
- 79 -minimum funding requirements for past service, a reduction in assets or an increase in liabilities
is made to the extent that minimum funding contributions payable to the plan will not be
available as either a refund or a reduction in future contributions. Consequently, the adjustments
are made to other comprehensive income.
K. Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Some equity instruments of which the balance sheet amount was the acquisition cost under
Japanese GAAP are measured at fair value under IFRS, and the adjustments for the resulting
differences are made to other comprehensive income. In addition, losses from valuation of
equity instruments that were impaired under Japanese GAAP are recognized in other
comprehensive income under IFRS.
(iv) Adjustments to cash flows
FY2015 (ended December 31, 2015)
The material differences between the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows disclosed in accordance
with Japanese GAAP and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows disclosed in accordance with
IFRS are as follows.
The expenditures associated with research and development expenses were classified as cash flows
from operating activities under Japanese GAAP because they were recognized as expenses when they
were incurred, while under IFRS, the capitalized research and development expenses have been
classified as cash flows from investing activities.
As a result, cash flows from investing activities decreased by ¥2,726 million and cash flows from
operating activities increased by the same amount.

Based on the concept of total health care, the Group has been operating its businesses to maintain and promote health and to diagnose
and treat disease. To anticipate social issues brought about by a highly uncertain world amid a changing social environment due to the
impact of the geopolitical risks, etc., the Group will incorporate new technologies and needs arising from changes in the environment
and harness the opportunities presented by a growing awareness of health in order to demonstrate the Group’s true value as a total
healthcare company, and continue to pursue initiatives aimed at the realization of sustainable growth.
Revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 totaled ¥2,018,568 million (up 16.1% over the previous fiscal year), as all
operating segments recorded increased revenue. The main factors were that growth in sales for the four global products, the long acting
antipsychotic agent ABILIFY MAINTENA, the antipsychotic agent REXULTI, the V2-receptor antagonist JYNARQUE, and the anti-
cancer agent LONSURF, in addition to growth in royalties and milestones for out-licensed products, drove results in the pharmaceutical
business. As a result, revenue grew significantly, exceeding the decline in revenue with the expiry of the exclusive sales period of the
V2-receptor antagonist Samsca for the treatment for fluid retention in patients with heart failure and hepatic cirrhosis in Japan.
Furthermore, in the nutraceutical business as well, sales of POCARI SWEAT and Nature Made continued to grow amid increasing
health awareness.
Business profit before research and development expenses was ¥620,358 million (up 37.8%). The main factors were as follows. On
one hand, the gross profit increased due to high sales for the four global products, and increased royalties and milestones for out-
licensed products. On the other hand, amid efforts to accelerate investment in new businesses, the SG&A expense ratio was reduced by
appropriately controlling selling, general and administrative expenses through efficient investment in existing businesses.
Research and development expenses totaled ¥307,804 million (up 11.8%) mainly due to development expenses based on a
collaboration and license agreement executed with Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd. for joint development and commercialization related to
antipsychotic agent with a novel mechanism of action, as well as due to steady progress for zipalertinib/TAS6417 under development
for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and sibeprenlimab/VIS649 which is under development for the treatment of IgA
nephropathy. There was also the impact of exchange rate fluctuations.
As a result of greater than anticipated sales growth and appropriate controls having been imposed on selling, general and
administrative expenses, business profit increased significantly to ¥312,553 million (up 78.7%).
Operating profit decreased to ¥139,612 million (down 7.1%). The main factors were the impact of recording a total of ¥172,419
million in impairment losses in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 due to an impairment loss on AVP-786, a drug for agitation
associated with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease, in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, in addition to impairment losses on
products pertaining to Daiya Foods Inc. and to a collaboration with Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd. recorded through the third quarter of
the fiscal year.
Profit for the year was ¥125,499 million (down 8.6%) and profit attributable to owners of the Company was ¥121,616 million (down
9.2%).

Main products
● Four global products
The Group positions the long acting antipsychotic agent ABILIFY MAINTENA, the antipsychotic agent
REXULTI*1/RXULTI*2, the V2-receptor antagonist Samsca/JINARC*3/JYNARQUE*4 and the anti-cancer agent LONSURF as
its four global products. Sales of those products totaled ¥726,850 million (up 17.4%).
*1: Brand name for the antipsychotic agent outside Europe
*2: Brand name for the antipsychotic agent in Europe
*3: Brand name for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (“ADPKD”) treatment in multiple regions outside Japan
*4: Brand name for ADPKD treatment in the U.S.
・ Long acting antipsychotic agent ABILIFY MAINTENA
In the U.S., sales increased atop growth in prescriptions, mainly due to promoting the efficacy of the product for
bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia patients, who have problems adhering to drug regimens, as well as face-to-face
detailing activities, and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. In Japan, sales grew steadily due to stronger
information provision activities for bipolar I disorder, in addition to schizophrenia. As a result, sales of ABILIFY
MAINTENA totaled ¥202,464 million (up 22.4%).
・ Antipsychotic agent REXULTI/RXULTI
In the U.S., the drug is sold as adjunctive therapy in major depressive disorder, as a treatment for schizophrenia, and
from May 2023, as a treatment for agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease. The Group is actively
engaged in activities to raise awareness of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease and is also
conducting DTC*5 advertising. Prescriptions grew and sales increased, mainly due to enhancement of face-to-face
detailing activities, as well as the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. In Japan, sales increased, boosted by new
prescriptions due to enhancement of detailing activities for schizophrenia. As a result, sales of REXULTI/RXULTI totaled
¥212,509 million (up 25.6%).
*5: Direct to consumer
・ V2-receptor antagonist Samsca
In Japan, the number of prescriptions for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (“ADPKD”) increased, and
the number of patients who have received treatment has exceeded 10,000 cases. On the other hand, sales significantly
decreased due to the impact of the launch of generics for the treatment for fluid retention in patients with heart failure
and hepatic cirrhosis. Also in the U.S., where the drug is sold as a treatment for hyponatremia, sales significantly
decreased due to the impact of the launch of generics. As a result, sales of Samsca totaled ¥48,230 million (down
45.1%).
・ V2-receptor antagonist JINARC/JYNARQUE
In the U.S., sales increased significantly as a result of an increase in the number of prescriptions for ADPKD mainly
due to continued efforts to raise awareness of the disease and provision of information about clinical data, as well as the
impact of exchange rate fluctuations. As a result, sales of JINARC/JYNARQUE totaled ¥183,541 million (up 31.7%).
・ Anti-cancer agent LONSURF
In the U.S., sales increased significantly due to the approval in August 2023 for the additional indication for treatment
in combination with bevacizumab for colorectal cancer, the recommendation of the combination therapy in NCCN
- 3 -Guidelines*6 and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. In Europe, sales increased due to the increase in the number
of prescriptions and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the combination therapy was approved in July
2023. In Japan, sales continued to be solid due to increased awareness of the combination therapy following the
publication of a research paper, etc. As a result, sales of LONSURF totaled ¥80,105 million (up 39.3%).
*6: Cancer treatment guidelines that are used widely around the world
2) Nutraceuticals
Revenue in the nutraceutical business for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 totaled ¥483,463 million (up 10.6%),
with business profit of ¥59,652 million (up 10.1%).
Main products
The Group positions POCARI SWEAT, Nature Made and the Nutrition & Santé SAS brand as its three major brands. Sales
of those brands totaled ¥312,998 million (up 14.8%). Total sales of its three nurture brands, the Daiya Foods Inc. brand,
EQUELLE and BODY MAINTÉ, were ¥27,851 million (down 2.3%).
● Three major brands
Sales volume of POCARI SWEAT, an electrolyte supplement drink, decreased temporarily due to the impact of the price
revision in April 2023 in Japan. However, sales volume increased during the summer this year, which had the highest
temperatures on record*7, due to the promotion of consumption accompanying rising interest in measures for heat disorder in
daily life and an increase in brand contact points and drinking experiences at sports events and hot spa facilities, and other
factors including our continuing education about hydration and replenishment of electrolytes. Overseas, more people have
been recognizing the importance of hydration and replenishment of electrolytes through activities to raise awareness that are
tailored to the culture and situation in each region. Through the building of a brand image through many years of initiatives,
sales volume is increasing. As a result, sales volume increased overall for the brand, leading to an increase in sales.
Sales of Nature Made supplements by Pharmavite LLC increased due to an expanded market share*8 in the U.S. backed by
high trust in the brand and quality, and also boosted by marketing activities through social media and the impact of exchange
rate fluctuations.
The Nutrition & Santé SAS brand, which sells health food products mainly in Europe, is expanding its food services*9 and
e-commerce. Although there was a sales decline due to the impact of business reorganization, Japanese yen-based sales
increased mainly due to growth in the main products such as Gerblé and the impact of the exchange rate fluctuations.
*7: Japan Meteorological Agency: The average temperatures during the summer (June to August 2023) throughout Japan were the highest since
recordkeeping began in 1898.
*8: IRI Data: Market Advantage; Calendar YTD 12/31/2023, Food, Drug, Mass Excluding Amazon and Costco
*9: Services for providing meals to public institutions, schools, etc.
● Three nurture brands
Plant-based foods of the Daiya Foods Inc. brand saw a decrease in sales, mainly due to increased competition in the dairy
alternative cheese market in North America. However, efforts have been made to enhance the product lineup by utilizing its
original technology and expand distribution.
Sales of EQUELLE, a food and supplement brand containing equol that supports women’s health and beauty, grew in Japan
due to increased recognition of the product through the wide-ranging spread of information on the product, including
seminars on women’s health, and due to a steady increase in the number of e-commerce subscriptions.
As for BODY MAINTÉ, a protective beverage brand containing the plant-based lactic-acid bacteria B240*10, although sales
declined, from December 2023, a new communication campaign has been started that proposes to manage one’s physical
condition on a daily basis in preparation for an important day, and efforts have been made to develop core users, raise
recognition and increase consumption of the product.
*10: Lactiplantibacillus pentosus ONRICb0240: Strain isolated by Tokyo University of Agriculture, for which Otsuka Pharmaceutical has
confirmed efficacy.
3) Consumer products
Revenue in the consumer product business for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 totaled ¥37,081 million (up 3.3%),
while business profit totaled ¥17,823 million (up 149.8%) in part due to an increase in share of profit of associates.
In mineral water products, sales of mainstay brand CRYSTAL GEYSER remained on par with the previous fiscal year in
Japan mainly by appealing to the brand value by communicating the environmental initiatives through the use of lightweight
bottles and caps and bottles made from 50% recycled raw materials, although sales volume decreased due to the impact of the
price revision. Sales volume of MATCH, a carbonated vitamin drink, increased due to an increase in the number of users of
existing products and strong sales of MATCH Salty Lemon Soda, which was launched in March 2023, and MATCH Vitamin
Mikan, which was launched in October 2023.
4) Others
Revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 totaled ¥176,395 million (up 4.2%), with business profit of ¥7,717
million (down 14.7%).
- 4 -Sales in the specialty chemical business remained on par with the previous fiscal year, despite a delayed recovery in the
semiconductor market and stagnation in the Chinese market. Sales in the fine chemical business increased mainly due to an
increase in sales of antibiotic intermediates.
In the transportation and warehousing business, despite the acquisition of new external customers and steady growth in
handling volume by strengthening the total healthcare distribution platform through coordination of logistics data, sales
decreased marginally due to a decline in the unit freight rates for international transportation.

The following provides details around cash flow movements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023:
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash flows provided by operating activities were ¥283,232 million, an increase of ¥71,384 million compared to the previous
fiscal year. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 mainly consisted of ¥142,655

losses and reversal of impairment losses, ¥31,802 million increase in trade and other receivables and ¥80,982 million of income taxes
paid.
Cash inflows from operating activities increased by ¥71,384 million from the previous fiscal year, despite the decrease in profit
before tax due to the recording of impairment losses related to AVP-786, Daiya Foods Inc. and collaboration with Sumitomo Pharma
Co., Ltd. and a ¥45,732 million increase in outflow of income taxes paid. This was due to the large growth of royalties and
milestones for four global products and out-licensed products in the pharmaceutical business, which drove the business performance
and contributed significantly to the increase in cash flow from operating activities.

Net cash flows used in investing activities were ¥190,538 million, an increase in outflows of ¥108,963 million compared to the

assets, and ¥71,043 million of payments for acquisition of subsidiaries such as Bonafide Health, a company specializing in the
creation and sale of products for women’s health. The increase of ¥108,963 million in outflows was primarily due to a ¥29,787
million increase of payments for acquisition of property, plant and equipment and a ¥71,043 million increase of payments for
acquisition of subsidiaries.

(Note) FY2024 projected exchange rate: 138 Yen/USD 150 Yen/EUR
In the pharmaceutical business, revenue is expected to increase with results strongly driven by growth in royalty income from the
four global products (ABILIFY MAINTENA, REXULTI/RXULTI, JINARC/JYNARQUE and LONSURF) and for out-licensed products. In
the nutraceutical business, revenue is expected to increase due to growth in sales of three major brands (POCARI SWEAT, Nature Made
and the Nutrition & Santé SAS brand) and three nurture brands (Daiya Foods Inc. brand, EQUELLE and BODY MAINTÉ).
Regarding selling, general and administrative expenses, the Group will engage in growth investment involving large new businesses
that take on challenges in new frontiers. Meanwhile, the Group will also promote further cost adjustments in existing businesses.
Regarding research and development expenses, the Group expects to invest in sibeprenlimab/VIS649 under development for the
treatment of IgA nephropathy, AVP-786 under development for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer’s
disease, and TAS6417 under development for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, among others, with a view toward achieving
sustainable growth.
- 10 -Business profit is expected to be higher than the one for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as sales of the four global products
and the nutraceutical business are expected to increase and further cost adjustments in existing businesses are promoted, despite
promotion of investment in new businesses.
Operating profit is expected to increase due to recording substantial impairment losses during the year.
For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, the Company projects consolidated revenue of ¥2,140,000 million (up 6.0% over the
current fiscal year), business profit before research and development expenses of ¥638,000 million (up 2.8%), business profit of
¥330,000 million (up 5.6%), operating profit of ¥330,000 million (up 136.4%), profit before tax of ¥330,000 million (up 131.3%),
profit for the year of ¥254,000 million (up 102.4%), and profit attributable to owners of the Company of ¥250,000 million (up 105.6%).

Changes in Accounting Policies
The Group applied IAS 12 “Income Taxes” (amended in May 2021) from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.
IFRS Description of new standard, interpretations and amendments
Clarification of accounting treatment for deferred taxes related to assets and liabilities
IAS 12 Income Taxes
arising from a single transaction
The application of this standard clarifies the accounting treatments on initial recognition for transaction that give rise to equal taxable
and deductible temporary differences at the time of the transaction, and results in the recognition of taxable and deductible temporary
differences as deferred tax liabilities and assets, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
As a result of the application of the standard, the previous fiscal year’s consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively
restated. The effect of the application decreased deferred tax assets by ¥77 million, increased deferred tax liabilities by ¥101 million,
and decreased total equity by ¥178 million which consisted of decreases of retained earnings by ¥150 million, other components of
equity by ¥1 million, and non-controlling interests by ¥26 million in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December
31, 2022. In addition, the effect increased income tax expenses by ¥139 million and decreased profit for the year by ¥139 million in the
Consolidated Statements of Income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
Due to the cumulative effect of application of this standard, the beginning balance of retained earnings for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2022 decreased by ¥37 million in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity.
Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgments
In preparing IFRS-compliant consolidated financial statements, management is required to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Such estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The effects of the review of accounting estimates are
recognized in the accounting period in which the review was conducted and future accounting periods. Items that may have significant
effects on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements are as follows:
● Impairment of intangible assets
● Fair value measurement of financial instruments
● Recoverability of deferred tax assets
● Measurement of defined benefit obligations
● Estimation of statutory and contractual rebates related to the public health system in the U.S.

- 22 -Impairment of Assets
FY2022 (Fiscal year ended December 31, 2022)
The Group recorded impairment losses of ¥41,521 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, ¥38,286 million of which
related to the pharmaceutical business.
In the pharmaceutical business, the Group received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for vadadustat for the treatment of anemia during or prior to the dialysis phase, indicating that the application is not ready for
approval in its present form. As a result, impairment losses of ¥23,584 million were recorded, with carrying amounts of in-process
research and development recognized as intangible assets and other related assets reduced to zero.
FY2023 (Fiscal year ended December 31, 2023)
The Group recorded impairment losses of ¥172,419 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, ¥136,677 million of which
related to the pharmaceutical business and ¥26,065 million related to the nutraceutical business.
In the pharmaceutical business, the main impairment losses were ¥105,495 million in impairment loss of AVP-786 under
development for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease and ¥23,106 million in impairment loss
related to intangible assets recorded based on a collaboration and license agreement executed with Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd. for joint
development and commercialization.
Concerning AVP-786, the Group received results of Phase III of clinical studies (305 studies) targeting agitation associated with
dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease, indicating that the studies did not meet the primary endpoint. Due to a delay beyond the initially
anticipated approval application timeline and diminished probability of market approval, the Group re-evaluated intangible assets (in-
process research and development). As a result, impairment losses of ¥105,495 million were recorded, with carrying amount of the
intangible assets reduced to its recoverable amount, which is the value in use. For calculation of the value in use, the discount rate
(10.6%) based on the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital was used.
The Group received results of clinical studies which relate to intangible assets recorded based on a collaboration and license
agreement executed with Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd. for joint development and commercialization, indicating that DIAMOND 1 and
DIAMOND 2 clinical studies (Phase III) evaluating “ulotaront” in acutely psychotic adults with schizophrenia did not meet their
primary endpoint. Due to a confirmed delay beyond the initially anticipated approval application timeline, the Group re-evaluated the
intangible assets (in-process research and development). As a result, impairment losses of ¥23,106 million were recorded, with carrying
amount of the intangible assets reduced to its recoverable amount, which is the value in use. For calculation of the value in use, the
discount rate (12.3%) based on the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital was used.
In the nutraceutical business, the profitability of Daiya Foods Inc., which develops, manufactures and sells plant-based foods in
North America, declined as a result of increased competition in the dairy alternative cheese market in North America. Accordingly, the
Group reduced the carrying amount of the assets related to Daiya Foods Inc. to the recoverable amounts and recorded impairment
losses of ¥24,828 million (¥12,707 million for goodwill, ¥2,477 million for trademarks, distribution rights and others and ¥9,643
million for other intangible assets). The recoverable amounts are measured at fair value less costs of disposal. The fair value less costs
of disposal is measured primarily by taking into account the analysis of the income approach, and is calculated by discounting the
estimated amount of future cash flows for the next 10 years, based on the business plan reflecting past experience and external
information and being approved by management, using a discount rate of 12.8%, which is calculated as pre-tax weighted average cost
of capital. Beyond the projected period of the business plan, subsequent growth rate is estimated to be 3.0%. The hierarchy for the fair
value is Level 3.

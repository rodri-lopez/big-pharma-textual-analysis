The DNA of Otsuka Generates
Innovative Products
From Tokushima to the World
The Otsuka group will soon celebrate the 100th anniversary. The DNA of our group, cultivated ceaselessly over
the years, is connected to the challenges that the group undertakes in all of our businesses. We share our unwav-
ering corporate philosophy of “Otsuka-people creating new products for better health worldwide” with all our
employees around the world and are continuing to create and provide new values to the world to this day.
Chemical Raw Materials from Bittern,
the Salt Pan Residues
A Global Company Started in Tokushima
The origin of the Otsuka group goes back to 1921, when Busaburo Otsuka, the founder of the Otsuka group,
established Otsuka Seiyaku Kogyo-bu in Naruto, Tokushima Prefecture. The Company had just ten employ-
ees, when it started as a chemical raw material manufacturer, making magnesium carbonate from the resi-
dues (called “bittern”) left over after taking the salt out of seawater by the salt-production industry that was
widespread in Tokushima back then.
In the Meiji period (1868-1912), Tokushima was one of Japan’s ten largest cities. In addition to Japan’s larg-
est indigo dye industry, the city boasted secondary industries such as pharmaceutical and salt productions.
It also had prosperous agriculture, forestry, and fishing industries that reaped the bounty of nature.
With the modernization of Japan at that time, entrepreneurial businesses began to spring up all over the
country. In the Seto Inland Sea Coast area, an industry that made effective use of bittern from the area’s nat-
ural salt pans emerged, and many companies in Tokushima participated in the industry. Our group was also
founded on that trend, which marked the beginning of a global company today operating in 28 countries and
regions with 46,000 employees worldwide.03

Creation through Paradigm Shifts
The Giant Tomato Tree in Our Birthplace
The Human Resource Development Institute, the training center for employees located in Tokushima, Japan,
has several monuments depicting Sozosei (creativity), a concept that lies at the root of our group’s corpo-
rate philosophy.
One of them is the Giant Tomato Tree. Whereas a normal tomato plant yields only about 50 to 60 fruits, our
tomato tree puts forth around 10,000. The secret behind this lies in a paradigm shift. We abandoned the pre-
conception that, “since tomato plants grow in soil, soil is essential.” This enabled us to set the tomato plant’s
roots free from soil, using hydroponic cultivation instead. By drawing out the fecundity of the tomato tree, it
yielded an amount of fruit that no one had considered possible.
Our Giant Tomato Tree and other monuments break through preconceptions and speak to the importance
of paradigm shifts, while also communicating the message that we need to remain as a company brimming
with creativity.04

Never-give-up R&D
A Drug developed Over 26 years of Effort
Brings Hope to Renal Disease Treatment
For us, the DNA of our group is found not only in displaying the creativity to do what others do not, but also
in our stance of challenging what we believe correct over a long period of time with never-give-up spirit.
A demonstration of this is Samsca/JINARC*/JYNARQUE**, a V2-receptor antagonist that has grown into
a core product of the Otsuka group. This drug discovery project began in 1983 with a physician’s request:
“I want a diuretic that excretes only water.” Following 26 years of persistent research, the project came to
fruition in 2009 with the launch of an aquaretic agent Samsca. For a typical company, closing down a drug
discovery project extending to 26 years midway would be no great surprise. But the Otsuka group’s commit-
ment to actualize our corporate philosophy—“Otsuka-people creating new products for better health world-
wide”—led to continuation of the research and development, and eventually the development of the product.
Following the launch, we have expanded the indications of Samsca/JINARC/JYNARQUE to the treatment
of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a disease that did not have any curative medi-
cines. Our never-give-up R&D has opened a new path to the treatment of an intractable kidney disease.

An Enduring Corporate Philosophy and
Value Creation for Further Leaps Forward
The Business
Contributing to People’s Health Worldwide
Environment and
In the healthcare field changes are occurring constantly. Due to fac-
Our Goal tors such as the ageing of populations, changing patterns of disease
prevalence, and earlier diagnoses, and the accompanying increase
in demand for medicines, the global pharmaceutical market has con-
tinued to grow and is now valued at more than one trillion U.S. dol-
lars. Competition for scale and growth is also intensifying, reflected
by the frequency of mergers and acquisitions and the often-related
industry restructurings. Also, escalating research and development
costs necessitate huge investment, encouraging risk-sharing alliances.
Simultaneously, measures to control and optimize medical costs are
expanding in the U.S. and many other countries, with the aim of curb-
ing increasing drug costs.
A big wave of technological innovation has extended to the health-
care sector. Companies are utilizing the latest technologies, including
big data analysis and artificial intelligence, for drug discovery and devel-
opment. This has led to rising expectations of medical breakthroughs,
such as development of new drugs for previously untreatable condi-
tions. As a result, we are seeing improving healthcare outcomes in18

different diseases and geographies around the world. As the health-
care sector approaches these major inflection points, we constantly ask
ourselves what we need to do to contribute and to thrive in this envi-
ronment. And the answer is simple—unwavering goals and continued
innovations.
Since its foundation, the group has maintained an unwavering com-
mitment to its corporate philosophy—“Otsuka-people creating new
products for better health worldwide.” Guided by this philosophy, we
have constantly pursued what only we can achieve, ideally pre-anticipat-
ing changes in the business environment, and when that is not possi-
ble, responding flexibly and swiftly to the changes.
Seeking to meet the universal aspiration of people around the world
to be healthy, we regard healthcare as a whole-body domain, and our
activities are based on two pillars: the pharmaceutical business, which
extends from the diagnosis of diseases through to treatment, and the
nutraceutical business, which helps people maintain and improve day-
to-day health. Walking alongside customers to identify and meet their
healthcare needs, we have introduced innovative products and services
that have created markets that previously did not exist.

Message from the President
Otsuka’s Business
Contributing to people’s health through
Model pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals
In recent years many pharmaceutical companies, based on a business
review and concentration strategy, increasingly have focused on areas
that require deep and specific expertise. For example, some emphasize
new drug development in areas such as oncology while others are ded-
icated to generic drugs in emerging economies. Amid such trends, why
did the Otsuka group boldly choose a business portfolio encompassing
both pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals?
It is not that these two areas of health are unrelated to each other;
in fact, they are as closely related as the two sides of a coin. Through
these two businesses, we can contribute to the health of “all” peo-
ple, and this is the most compelling reason why we have built a port-
folio covering both. Second, we apply the exacting scientific standards
that apply in our prescription drug business to our development of new
nutraceutical products and to our evaluation of their health benefits.
This assures our customers that the standards underpinning our prod-
ucts are highly credible.
The creation of products for the treatment and prevention of dis-
eases, as well as for the maintenance and improvement of health, is
precisely the role of the Otsuka group of companies. Once we have ful-
filled it, we will be far advanced toward our ultimate goal, which is to
become an indispensable contributor to people’s health worldwide.
Furthermore, there is a positive momentum to spur to our strategy.
Healthcare increasingly is about not only curing diseases but also about
maintaining and improving everyday health. This trend is anticipated to
eventually improve quality of life and extend healthy life expectancy.
Accordingly, products and services with the themes of maintaining and
improving health are showing excellent growth.
By developing our pharmaceutical and nutraceutical businesses,
we can build a resilient portfolio and a business structure conducive
to sustainable growth. Pharmaceuticals is a higher-risk, higher-return
business. If our R&D succeeds, we can look forward to commensurate
returns once products are launched. On the other hand, multiple factors
can adversely affect our earnings. These include expiration of drug pat-
ents and government measures to reduce and optimize medical costs,
exemplified by the lowering of drug prices in Japan.
In contrast, nutraceuticals is a medium-risk, medium-return busi-
ness. Although we cannot expect profits margins akin to the pharma-
ceutical business, we can build a stable, long-term earnings foundation
if we are able to provide added value through innovative products while
continuing to invest in a solid brand image. In order to achieve sustain-
able growth, a company must lay the foundation for it and we believe
that having a diversified business portfolio gives us strength to do so.20
Otsuka Holdings Co., Ltd. INTEGRATED REPORT 2017
The Otsuka group has a long and proud history and will soon celebrate
the 100th anniversary of our founding. At this point in time, the pharma-
ceutical business is our main growth driver. In the 1990s, however, our
nutraceutical business was larger in scale. Without the nutraceutical
business, our R&D efforts, resulting in multiple drugs that are current
growth drivers, would not have succeeded.
DNA and Core
Beliefs inherited since our foundation
Competency
From our foundation in 1921 to the present, based on enduring prin-
ciples, Otsuka has always been committed to manufacturing innova-
tive and creative products that contribute to the health of the people
around the world. In our quest to create and deliver new value, we
ask ourselves the key questions: What are the things that only we can
achieve? Are we pursuing an innovative approach without being captive
to existing concepts and notions? Do our products appeal to consum-
ers, patients and healthcare providers around the world? Are we con-
tributing to an improvement in people’s health?
Whenever we encounter difficulties, we return to the enduring prin-
Ryukan godo
A calligraphic work by Otsuka founder, ciples implicit in our corporate philosophy and pursue our business with-
Busaburo Otsuka out wavering from our goals. This is how we have succeeded.
Take POCARI SWEAT as an example. Here, we have consistently
conveyed the concept of a “rehydration drink” that enables people to
easily replenish fluids and electrolytes lost through perspiration. Over a
period of time, this led to the creation of a new market for ion drinks and
the establishment of our brand. The growth of POCARI SWEAT is not
the result of short-term factors and trends but proof of the correctness
of decisions and actions based on our corporate philosophy.
We have inherited the three elements of Otsuka’s DNA passed down
by three past generations of Otsuka family leaders—Ryukan godo (by
POCARI SWEAT created the market for
sweat we recognize the way), Jissho (actualization), and Sozosei (cre-
ion drinks
ativity). Ryukan godo means the core substance of something that can
be discovered only through hard work and practice. Jissho is self-actu-
alization through achievement, completion, and the discovery of truth.
Sozosei, or “creativity,” epitomizes Otsuka’s corporate culture.
Today, we are a corporate group with consolidated net sales of nearly
USD 11 billion. The aforementioned three terms that have been passed
down by Otsuka’s family leaders, together with our venture spirit implicit
in our corporate philosophy, are shared with each and every employee,
and deeply penetrate our organization and systems as unchanging val-
ues that govern our daily business activities.

Becoming an
Diversified Human Resources Drive
Indispensable Company Business Growth
What else is required for the Osaka group to become an indispensable
contributor to people’s health worldwide? The answers lie in “human
resources” and “innovation.” Using these two elements as a driving
force, while applying knowledge and technologies accumulated to date,
fosters a harmonious environment for product creation. When this hap-
pens, innovative products are born—products help us address health
issues and achieve sustainability.
The Otsuka group comprises employees with diverse backgrounds.
We encourage them to learn our corporate culture and share Otsuka val-
ues, which emphasize creativity, then we foster and promote them as
appropriate.
At present, the Otsuka group has around 46,000 employees across
28 countries and regions, with employees outside of Japan represent-
ing approximately 60% of our workforce. By accepting and sharing
different languages, cultures, backgrounds, experiences, and perspec-
tives, we create a flexible and open-minded corporate culture that can
respond appropriately to the diversification of social needs and the glo-
balization of our business.
Among various initiatives, at the end of 2017 Otsuka became a signa-
tory to the Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs)*, a set of action
principles to guide companies seeking to foster the advancement of
women. We will continue strengthening our organization by promoting
the advancement of women.
Developing human resources as next-generation leaders is an import-
ant management priority for sustaining the group’s growth and increas-
ing its value as an innovative organization. The Otsuka group undertakes
a wide range of human resource development programs. These include
opportunities for employees to learn corporate culture, to share values that
emphasize creativity together with management, and to study abroad.
The mental and physical health of each employee is also essential
to achieve sustainable growth, and providing a healthy and support-
ive work environment is key to this endeavor. In April 2017, we issued
the Otsuka Group Declaration on Health. In line with this, we strive
to create a work environment where employees can exercise their full
abilities and display their originality, promote health of employees, and
enhance our organizational strength.

Pursuing value for customers and
timely innovations
The group has been creating new markets by creating pharmaceuti-
cals that address unmet medical needs, as well as nutraceuticals that
address yet-to-be imagined needs of consumers. In the pharmaceutical
business, we developed a drug tablet embedded with microchip—the
world’s first digital medicine which integrates a pharmaceutical and a
medical device. By recording ingestion of the medication, the aim is to
advance the care that can be offered to patients with schizophrenia. We
also developed one of only two new therapeutic agents in the past 50
years for the treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB),
which has become a serious health problem in some countries.
In the nutraceutical business, meanwhile, we utilize both our new and
in-line assets, cultivated through experience and achievements to date,
to create various new innovations. These include a food product contain-
ing soybean-derived equol, resulting from R&D on women’s health, and

an indispensable contributor to people’s health worldwide.

new antipsychotic agent REXULTI; and Samsca/JINARC, an aquaretic
agent with several indications such as cardiac edema and also as a
treatment for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)
—while sales of the anti-cancer agent LONSURF in Europe greatly
exceeded initial targets. Thanks to growth in these new products, we
solidified our business foundation.
We further reinforced the group’s business foundation with regula-
tory approvals in the U.S. for two products: Abilify MyCite, the first-ever
digital medicine and JYNARQUE for the treatment of the inherited kid-
ney disease ADPKD. With respect to product development, we obtained
the rights to centanafadine, for the treatment of attention-deficit hyper-
activity disorder (ADHD), through our acquisition of Neurovance. We
also formed an agreement covering Japan with Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries for fremanezumab, for the prevention of migraine. In addi-
tion, we expanded the geographic coverage of our collaboration with
Akebia Therapeutics for the joint development and marketing of vada-
dustat, a treatment for renal anemia. In these ways, we laid many cor-
nerstones for our next stage of growth.
In the nutraceutical business, we reported solid performance, post-
ing steady growth for existing products, while expanding our portfolio
to boost synergies. Specifically, in the U.S. we posted healthy growth in
the nutritional supplements businesses of Pharmavite and FoodState,
while in Europe Nutrition & Santé performed steadily under difficult eco-
nomic conditions. To further expedite global expansion, we acquired
Daiya Foods, which develops, manufactures, and markets plant-based
foods in North America, and we launched EQUELLE in the U.S. to sup-
port women’s health. In Japan, we fostered new products that par-
allel our global expansion efforts. Highlights included the launch of
BODYMAINTÉ, a new brand of conditioning food to support athletic
performance. As a result, the nutraceuticals business achieved an oper-
ating margin of 12%, maintaining the 10% or higher numerical target of
our medium-term management plan.
Fiscal 2018, the final year of the Second Medium-Term Management
Plan, will be a year for continuing the diversification of our revenue struc-
ture. When the plan was launched, the antipsychotic agent ABILIFY
accounted for around 40% of total net sales, and our challenge was
to secure other sources of revenue. Since then, however, we steadily
implemented the priority measures of the plan, and thanks to growth
in each core field, we are achieving revenue diversification. However,
some initiatives have been insufficient and some targets remain unat-
tained. To address these issues, we will again formulate and execute
strategies according to our corporate philosophy, in our quest to further
increase corporate value.24

Strengthening corporate governance is a priority in our quest to achieve
sustainable growth and improve corporate value over the medium and

The Otsuka group established its Corporate Governance Guidelines
in November 2015. In February 2017, we formed the Corporate
Governance Committee to serve as an advisory body to the board of
directors, with the aims of strengthening and increasing the transpar-
ency of governance. We also set up the Otsuka Group Global Code of
Business Ethics as a guide for employees around the world to observe,
and we established the Otsuka Group Global Anti-Corruption Policy,
which lays out our firm stance against corruption. These codes and pol-
icies require that each employee works with a high standard of ethics
and fulfills their responsibilities to society.
In addition, the company has appointed three outside directors, with

Otsuka Warehouse received the METI
Minister’s Award under the Excellent
Green Logistics Commendation Program
Otsuka Warehouse Co. Ltd., which handles logistics of pharmaceuticals and other products for the Otsuka group
of companies, received the METI Minister’s Award of the Excellent Green Logistics Commendation Program

tor in long working hours for drivers), improvement of productivity, and reduction in CO2 emissions made possi-
ble through the TruckBerth system developed by SEAOS, and by the advance reservation of truck-berth times by
Otsuka Warehouse and Seino Holdings.
Otsuka Warehouse will continue to partner with manufacturers in logistics to make logistics more efficient, as
well as to create a platform that addresses and contributes to social issues.
* The Minister’s Award recognizes businesses that have made remarkable contributions to the establishment of sustainable logistics systems
through reductions in environmental impacts in the logistics field, productivity improvements in logistics, etc.

Strengthening of systems for the stable supply of products through establishment of BCP and BCM
The Otsuka group has business continuity plans (BCP)
in place to ensure that the group continues to operate
as effectively as possible and is able to maintain a sta-
ble supply of products, even when large-scale earth-
quakes and disasters strike. From the perspective of
business continuity management (BCM), we incremen-
tally expanded its scope since we acquired ISO22301
certification in August 2012 for production and stable
supply of medicinal products, beverages, and foods. We
then acquired certification for stable supply of intrave-
nous solutions in April 2015, followed by stable supply
of anticancer drugs in May 2016, as we continue to work
to strengthen the business continuity capabilities of the
group overall.
Furthermore, we conduct regular group-wide drills
aimed at verifying the efficacy of BCP and confirming
issues and problems. In 2017, we conducted a joint
drill by major group companies based on the scenario
of an earthquake directly below Tokyo, and worked to
strengthen our response capabilities, adaptability, and
flexibility in preparation for the unexpected.

InformationSignificance of the Corporate Symbol
A symbolic representation of Otsuka group’s corporate philosophy, the corporate symbol adopts the initial ‘O’
of the corporate name as its motif. Representing the sky above, the large ‘O’ is rendered in gradations of Otsuka
BLUE and the small ‘O’ in Otsuka RED represents the focused energy of Otsuka, the wellspring of these tenets.
Offsetting the two forms poised in balance, the Otsuka name is spelled out in an open and friendly typeface.
The corporate symbol conveys Otsuka group’s energetic commitment to human happiness through good health.

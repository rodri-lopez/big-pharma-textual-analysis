Solutions for Human Health
Great East Japan Earthquake and the Mission of
the Otsuka Group
I would like to take this occasion to express my sorrow at the lives
that were lost in the Great East Japan Earthquake, and to extend
my deepest condolences to the survivors and those who were
affected. I pray for the early reconstruction of areas that were dev-
astated by the disaster.
As part of our relief efforts, the Otsuka Group donated products
made by Group companies including beverages, foods, pharma-
ceuticals and over-the-counter medicines, and gave money for
disaster relief (pages 7–8). The entire nation is mobilizing for the
reconstruction efforts, and the Otsuka Group will continue to
ensure the stable supply of our products in order to meet our
responsibilities as a manufacturer, as we endeavor to support the
health of the survivors.
Going Public and Seizing Opportunities
Otsuka Holdings, which was formed in 2008 as a holding company
for the Otsuka Group, went public in December 2010 with a listing
on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. By going public,
we will have greater opportunities to gain the support of a broader
group of stakeholders, and to receive their advice and guidance. It
also gives us the opportunity to reach a wider audience in commu-
nicating our dedication to making products, driven by our core
values of Sozosei (Creativity), or skill in the art of creating unique and

We promise to pursue timely and appropriate information disclo-
sure in order to raise the transparency of our business operations.
In addition, we will strengthen our compliance and corporate gover-
nance to fulfill our obligations as a public company, and respond to
the trust placed in us by stakeholders.

05 OTSUKA GROUP CSR REPORT 2011 OTSUKA GROUP CSR REPORT 2011 06I would like to take this occasion to express my sorrow at the lives
that were lost in the Great East Japan Earthquake, and to extend
my deepest condolences to the survivors and those who were
affected. I pray for the early reconstruction of areas that were dev-
astated by the disaster.
As part of our relief efforts, the Otsuka Group donated products
made by Group companies including beverages, foods, pharma-
ceuticals and over-the-counter medicines, and gave money for
disaster relief (pages 7–8). The entire nation is mobilizing for the
reconstruction efforts, and the Otsuka Group will continue to
ensure the stable supply of our products in order to meet our
responsibilities as a manufacturer, as we endeavor to support the
health of the survivors.
Otsuka Holdings, which was formed in 2008 as a holding company
for the Otsuka Group, went public in December 2010 with a listing
on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. By going public,
we will have greater opportunities to gain the support of a broader
group of stakeholders, and to receive their advice and guidance. It
also gives us the opportunity to reach a wider audience in commu-
nicating our dedication to making products, driven by our core
values of Sozosei (Creativity), or skill in the art of creating unique and
unequaled products, and Jissho (Proof through Execution), which
means delivering tangible results. We will listen to equity markets,
while continuing to leverage our creativity and execution, which are
imprinted in the identity of the Otsuka Group.
We promise to pursue timely and appropriate information disclo-
sure in order to raise the transparency of our business operations.

nance to fulfill our obligations as a public company, and respond to

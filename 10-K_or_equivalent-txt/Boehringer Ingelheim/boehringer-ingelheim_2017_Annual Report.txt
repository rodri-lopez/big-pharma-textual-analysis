HUMAN PHARMACEUTICALS ANIMAL HEALTH BIOPHARMACEUTICALSOur company
Improving the health and quality of life of patients is the goal of the
research-driven pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim. The
focus in doing so is on diseases for which no satisfactory treatment
option exists to date. The company therefore concentrates on develop-
ing innovative therapies that can extend patients’ lives. In animal health,
Boehringer Ingelheim stands for advanced prevention.
Family-owned since it was established in 1885, Boehringer Ingelheim
is one of the pharmaceutical industry’s top 20 companies. Some
50,000 employees create value through innovation daily for the three
business areas human pharmaceuticals, animal health and biopharma-
ceuticals. In 2017, Boehringer Ingelheim achieved net sales of almost
18.1 billion euros. R&D expenditure, exceeding three billion euros,
corresponded to 17.0 per cent of net sales.
As a family-owned company, Boehringer Ingelheim plans in generations
and focuses on long-term success, rather than short-term profit. The
company therefore aims at organic growth from its own resources with
simultaneous openness to partnerships and strategic alliances in
research. In everything it does, Boehringer Ingelheim naturally adopts
responsibility towards mankind and the environment.

04What role does
agility play in the
Boehringer Ingelheim
tradition?
Boehringer Ingelheim’s initial success as
a family-owned company was based
on the industrial production of acids. The move
from mass-produced chemical raw materials to
patent-protected pharmaceutical specialties
required building up a successful own research
operation and called for understanding a new
customer class – physicians. This example of
agility, which turned us into the leading research-
driven pharmaceutical company we are today,
should serve as an inspiration to us during the
current transformation of the healthcare market
to also adapt to the needs of those who have to
finance our healthcare system.”

08“It is about doing
the right thing”
Strategic decisions demand great flexibility and courage
from the people involved. When the Animal Health organisations
of Boehringer Ingelheim and Sanofi merged, two corporate
cultures and many different nationalities found their way into a
single melting pot that is now Boehringer Ingelheim’s new Animal
Health Business Unit. Rogier Biemans, Site Director in Pirbright
(UK) and originally from the Boehringer Ingelheim organisation,
and Vanessa Mariani, Global Commercial Operations Integration
Lead and former Merial employee, discuss how they bring together
the best of both worlds.

ABIEMANS For me it’s how people
interact with each other. This relates to
the underlying values. At Boehringer
Ingelheim there is a structured way of
working, people are always correct and
respectful. This creates a certain
atmosphere that determines how
people interact with each other.
MARIANI Culture – whether it’s in
society at large or in a corporation – is
down to behaviour and everyday life.
You can have a written code, but it’s
really how you live the underlying values
that build a culture.
What are the main differences in the
cultures of Merial and Boehringer
Ingelheim?
MARIANI I found that Merial was a lot
more lax and more open about structur-
ing the daily business, which probably
had to do with the fact that it was
previously a joint venture. This gave the
organisation great freedom to operate.
BIEMANS I agree. At the beginning of
this year, we had a global operations
conference at the Merial headquarters
in Lyon. It was a three-day conference

MARIANI Yes, for many people
coming from a more lax environment,
a tight framework can be a little bit of
a shock.
You’ve both worked in various loca­
tions. How does the culture differ in
each place?
BIEMANS With Boehringer Ingelheim
there’s a common corporate culture,
but certain elements are unique for each
location. The country hugely influences
the way people interact. The type of
location also plays a role, whether it’s a
production site or an office.

AMORE THAN SCLERODERMA
Scleroderma, or systemic sclerosis
(SSc), is a rare, so far incurable disease.
It is characterised by hardening of the
skin and connective tissue. It affects
around two million people worldwide1
and three times more women than
men, mainly in mid-life. Lung diseases
are a common manifestation of
systemic sclerosis. This is particularly
serious as most patients develop
pulmonary fibrosis to some extent.
Boehringer Ingelheim – a leader in
respiratory medicine – has been
conducting active research into the
potential fatal consequences of fibrotic
lung diseases for years. With its global
initiative “More than Scleroderma: The
Inside Story”, Boehringer Ingelheim is
pursuing the goal of educating society
as a whole and providing information
about the disease to those interested.
To this end, the company collects
inspiring stories from patients all
over the world and publishes brief
portraits of their lives on the website
www.boehringer-ingelheim.com. These
portraits may be video interviews or

The goal: innovative digital solutions for the

areas. The BI X team has, for instance,
developed an app for the digital early detecti-
on of Alzheimer’s disease. The aim is to
determine by only analysing speech whether
a person is showing early signs of the disease.
“Alzheimer’s research is linked to the traditional
businesses at Boehringer Ingelheim, but the
app offers a service that does not yet exist in
this form. What’s more, nobody else has done
anything like it before,” Michael Schmelmer

works, then we can address more high-risk
matters.” However, what kind these might be

What is important to the patient? What are the unfulfilled
needs and how can research be tangibly applied to help
address those needs? In order to get to the bottom of such
questions, Boehringer Ingelheim launched the Scorecard
Project in the USA in March 2017. Eight cross­disciplinary
teams now look far beyond the therapeutic areas of a
traditional research­driven pharmaceutical company ―
and they work in very close cooperation with the patients
themselves to improve clinical trials and gain a better
understanding of patients’ needs. This is done by
employing questionnaires and one­on­one patient
interviews, as well as moderated online discussions on
a digital consultation platform.

Pigs are romping about Boehringer Ingelheim’s corporate
site in Ingelheim, Germany. But the animals can only be seen
by people wearing special goggles. A Microsoft Hololens
allows interactive 3­D images to be projected onto the
immediate environment. Hand movements can herd the
pigs and, when touching them, you can even hear a gentle
grunt. A tool like this could in future help farmers administer
medicines to their animals. However, this is still a long way
off. The aim of Boehringer Ingelheim and the Fraunhofer
Institute for Software and System Technology (ISST) was to
test in a three­month pilot project the opportunities this
new technology can offer. An employee from the IT
department had requested further research into this
innovative, dynamic digital approach via the company’s
special “Accelerate” internal platform. Boehringer Ingelheim
agreed to the request and supported the development of the
pilot project with 50,000 euros.

encourages Boehringer Ingelheim employees. The MMH Convention
gave the participants the opportunity to network, inform themselves
about innovative local and international MMH projects, and unleash
new cooperations. Three pillars provided the framework: co­creation
as a bond between social responsibility and business; social innovation
of 85 social entrepreneurs in the MMH network; and the fostering of
entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial thinking. This changemaker
programme is an innovative way to develop leadership skills. The
convention delivered an exhibition, different workshops, success

The combination of immuno­oncology therapy concepts is an essential
part of Boehringer Ingelheim’s cancer research. The strategy focuses on
turning tumours that are hidden to the immune system visible and
therefore enable the body’s immune system to recognize and attack these
tumours — an approach that can be commonly described as “turning cold
tumours into hot tumours”. The researchers are focusing on novel
approa ches that might result in breakthrough treatments for patients with
difficult­to­treat conditions such as lung cancer or g astrointestinal cancers.
Despite recent treatment advances, lung cancer still is the number one
cancer killer. Gastrointestinal tumours have been of increasing importance
over the last years and are among the most frequent cancers in Asia.
To bring the results of oncology research to patients quickly, Boehringer
Ingelheim is collaborating with Sarah Cannon Cancer Research Institute,
US, to conduct clinical trials. The expertise of this partner supports the
research­driven pharmaceutical company in identifying the right patients
and in optimally supporting them in clinical trials so that meaningful
results of high quality may be achieved in a timely manner. Boehringer
Ingelheim’s goal remains always to accelerate the development of
innovative cancer treatments for patients with high therapeutic need.

An open, unbiased way of thinking requires a
corresponding (working) environment. That is
why Boehringer Ingelheim has reshaped its
Ridgefield site in the USA. The Inclusive
Campus has now been completely redesigned
with diversity and inclusion in mind — from its
workstations and parking places to its
bathroom facilities. Another example is a
re­designed auditorium, with wheelchair access
and technology to support employees with
hearing impairments. The project was
instigated and implemented by the Ridgefield
workforce. This is a clear example of the
changes that teams are able to bring about
when everyone pulls together.

It is often difficult to correctly
interpret the symptoms of the rare
disease idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (IPF). However, a fast
diagnosis is decisive. In Denmark,
a virtual reality game is helping
doctors to hone their awareness —
for example, by interpreting
various lung noises in the virtual
world, or by investigating healthy
lung tissue or that of an IPF
sufferer. Boehringer Ingelheim’s
brand and communication team
in Denmark developed the game
in record time last year so that it
could be employed for the first
time at the annual conference for
Danish lung specialists.

Today’s modern workers desire flexibility
and a healthy work­life balance. Innovative
companies, like Boehringer Ingelheim,
identify this transformation and turn to
programmes such as Remote Year for support
and inspiration. Remote Year is an organised
development programme that brings together
a mix of international professionals,
free lancers and entrepreneurs to live and work
as a community in twelve global cities over a
whole year. Remote Year promises to provide
personal and professional growth, giving
participants the opportunity to learn from
one another and immerse themselves in
different local cultures and business ecosys­
tems. Anne­Madeleine Kleinwächter, Global
Senior Manager Leadership Development at
Boehringer Ingelheim, is the first Boehringer
Ingelheim employee to take part in this
programme. Anne­Madeleine’s itinerary
covers both emerging and mature markets
and consists of cities as e.g.: Prague,
Lisbon, Kyoto, Kuala Lumpur, Chiang
Mai, Buenos Aires and Mexico City.

respimat® pocket inhaler in Sant Cugat,
Spain, is to go into production by September
2019. The ground­breaking ceremony took
place in June 2017. The path to this point
involved several hurdles, but the project and
engineering teams were ultimately able to stay
on schedule and to obtain planning permission
from the local authorities. In the future,
Boehringer Ingelheim will manufacture up to
20—25 million cartridges for the respimat®
inhaler every year and also package the
finished product in Sant Cugat.

It all began in October 2014 in Dubai in the United Arab
Emirates. After the first stroke center was set up there,
with the support of Boehringer Ingelheim, the “META
Stroke Initiative” quickly expanded to the rest of the
META region, consisting of Middle East, Turkey and the
Africa region. Because every second counts in the
treatment of stroke patients’ lives, the initiative aims at
creating stroke centers of excellence all over the region,
spreading knowledge and experience locally. As a result
of the initiative, the thrombolysis rate was increased
from 0.001 per cent when the initiative was established
to 3 per cent in 2017. The initiative focuses on more
than 19 countries, with its board including 14 specialists
from eight of those countries. Together with Boehringer
Ingelheim and the health authorities, its objective is to
heighten public awareness about stroke. The initiative
meanwhile succeeded in increasing the number of
treated stroke patients from around 1,400 in 2015 to
more than 10,000 in 2017. The incidence of stroke is on
the rise around the world. The “META Stroke Initiative”
is part of the Boehringer Ingelheim­initiated “Angels
Initiative” that cooperates with leading stroke organisa­
tions and experts. The goal is to improve acute stroke
care for patients worldwide.

2017 was a year of change for Boehringer Ingelheim’s
animal health business. Two former competitors became
one. Previous strangers became colleagues and supervisors.
In order to make the transition as seamless as possible,
the staff of Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health in the
Philippines organised the “Camp ONE” project, a team­
building activity not only calling for mental agility.
Everybody understood that the merger would mean that
everyone would have to operate outside their comfort zone.
The project was a success: the new animal health business
in the Philippines already enjoyed a significant increase in
sales in the second half of the year.

the big picture
When the Boehringer Ingelheim Science Department was founded
100 years ago, future Nobel Prize winner Heinrich Wieland
ensured that this was done in a future-oriented way. Today, the
company’s scientific activities are bundled in the Innovation Unit,
which continues to embody the company’s spirit of research.
Although scientists such as Michael Mark do things quite
differently now compared to Wieland’s time, there are still lots
of similarities.

Improving the health and quality of life of patients is the
goal of the research-driven pharmaceutical company
Boehringer Ingelheim. The focus in doing so is on diseases
for which no satisfactory treatment option exists to date.
The company therefore concentrates on developing innova-
tive therapies that can extend patients’ lives. In animal health,
Boehringer Ingelheim stands for advanced prevention.
Family-owned since it was established in 1885, Boehringer
Ingelheim is one of the pharmaceutical industry’s top
20 companies. Some 50,000 employees create value through
innovation daily for the three business areas human
pharmaceuticals, animal health and biopharmaceuticals.
In 2017, Boehringer Ingelheim achieved net sales of almost
18.1 billion euros. R&D expenditure, exceeding three billion
euros, corresponded to 17.0 per cent of net sales.
As a family-owned company, Boehringer Ingelheim plans
in generations and focuses on long-term success, rather
than short-term profit. The company therefore aims at
organic growth from its own resources with simultaneous
openness to partnerships and strategic alliances in research.
In everything it does, Boehringer Ingelheim naturally adopts
responsibility towards mankind and the environment.c o n t e n t

02THE SHAREHOLDERS’ PERSPECTIVE
With gratitude and satisfaction we present to you Boehringer Ingelheim’s
positive results for 2017 in this Annual Report. This report is the proof that
we reached more patients – both human and animal – and that with our
medicines we made a positive contribution to their disease progression and
thereby to their health.
Over the past few years, the structure and positioning of our company have
undergone fundamental change. And even if the work is not quite finished, we
have already successfully completed the fundamental tasks.
Boehringer Ingelheim’s primary objective is and remains to maintain our
independence as a family-owned company, at the same time helping people
and animals with innovative medicines. We are convinced that the dedication
and commitment of our staff is of great value over and above economic
success. In 2017, we once again clearly demonstrated where we come from
and who we are. With the global “Our FOCUS” initiative, we described our
path towards innovation and growth in the future.
In times of change and upheaval in particular, this gives all our employees
clear, joint orientation and motivation. We would like to expressly thank each
and every one of them for successfully stepping up to the challenges of the
past year and for all their energy and commitment in working to achieve our
company goals.

05KEY ASPECTS 2017
We thank you for your interest in our company and are pleased to inform you about Boehringer Ingelheim
and the progress over the past year. On the one hand, this concerns the Annual Report with the yearly
financial statements. On the other hand, we would again like to invite you to find out more about us in
the accompanying “Agility” report.
2017 was a successful year for Boehringer Ingelheim with growth in all businesses. We would like to
highlight our human pharmaceuticals business, which showed organic, profitable and distinctly
above-market growth.
We are not, however, just looking at sales figures, but rather see them standing for patients with very
different medical histories. All of us at Boehringer Ingelheim are motivated by the desire to make an
important contribution to the health of people and animals. For generations, Boehringer Ingelheim
employees have been researching, developing and manufacturing innovative medicines to positively
change the lives of patients. We will invest relatively large sums in the research of new medicines in the
future too and have set ourselves the goal, particularly in the human pharmaceuticals business, of
75 per cent of our innovations being the first for patients with the relevant therapeutic approach or
mode of action.
The strategic decisions of 2015 and 2016 have laid the foundations for a new period of successful
growth for Boehringer Ingelheim. We are thus focused on long-term success.
As in other sectors too, digitisation means sustained change – particularly in data-based industries like
ours. With our new BI X lab and through a range of other initiatives, we are facing up to this challenge.
We see opportunity here.
We have achieved a great deal over the past year. This success is reflected in the trust our c ustomers have
in us, for which we would like to thank them. We would also like to thank our partners, who accompa-
nied and supported us on our journey over the past year. But very special thanks go to each of our
employees, who stand for all that we have achieved, who faced new challenges and overcame them
with dedication, and who share our passion for making a positive contribution through innovation
to the health of people and animals alike.

launched initiatives over the past few years to accelerate

complexities as well as to lower our cost base in order to
create potential for investments and to secure the com-
pany’s long-term success. With the difficult market envi-

As a family-owned company, Boehringer Ingelheim’s pri-
mary aim is to maintain the firm’s independence and com-
petitiveness. As such, long-term and sustainable organic
growth still takes precedence over short-term profit tar-
gets. We are confident that we will achieve our ambitious
targets thanks to our great innovative strength based on
a comprehensive portfolio of prospective products, our
global presence and the support of our highly qualified and
motivated employees. Current product launches and
expansions in emerging markets will boost growth in all
our areas of business. We will stand by our vision “Value
through Innovation” and hence research and develop
innovative products that offer high medical benefits and
bring them to the market. As a result of our efforts, we
will provide new medicines that will enable doctors to
treat patients with novel therapies more effectively.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
1 Principles and methods
1.1 General principles
The consolidated financial statements of Boehringer Ingelheim for the 2017 financial year were prepared in
accordance with Section 264a of the German Commercial Code (HGB), in line with the legal requirements to

the cash flow statement and the statement of changes in equity.
The consolidated financial statements were prepared in euros in accordance with Section 298 (1) in conjunction
with Section 244 HGB.
To improve the clarity and transparency of the consolidated financial statements, individual items of the
consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated profit and loss statement have been combined. These items
are presented and explained separately in the notes. The additional disclosures required for the individual
items can also be found in the notes.
1.2 Registry information
The parent company is registered under the name C. H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Co. KG, with its headquarters
in Ingelheim, in the commercial register of Mainz district court under the number HRA 21732.
1.3 Information on companies included in the consolidation
The parent company of the Boehringer Ingelheim Group is C. H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Co. KG, Ingelheim.
Boehringer AG, Ingelheim, is the sole personally liable managing shareholder of this company.
Besides C. H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Co. KG, there is C. H. Boehringer Sohn Grundstücksverwaltung

addition to C. H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Co. KG and C. H. Boehringer Sohn Grundstücksverwaltung GmbH
& Co. KG, a further 155 companies in which C. H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Co. KG directly or indirectly holds
the majority of voting rights have been included in the consolidated financial statements under full consoli-
dation rules.
38PRODUCT PORTFOLIO
In accordance with Section 296 (2) HGB, 22 companies were not included in the consolidation in the
reporting year, as they are individually and collectively insignificant to the Group’s net assets, financial and
earnings position. The total amount of the sales, equity and net income for the year of the companies not
included in consolidation accounts for less than 1% of the aggregated Group financial statements totals.
For two further affiliated companies there are ongoing restrictions on control due to the terms of the articles
of association. These companies were also not consolidated in accordance with Section 296 (1) No. 1 HGB.
The total number of affiliated companies increased by 38 compared to the previous year:
• 36 companies were acquired in the exchange of business areas between Boehringer Ingelheim and Sanofi
completed on 1 January 2017.
• Two companies (Pharmaton S. A. and SSP Co. Ltd.) were sold in the exchange of business areas between
Boehringer Ingelheim and Sanofi.
• Seven companies were founded.
• Two companies lost their separate legal identity by merger (Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health GmbH
and Merial GmbH: the latter was acquired in the exchange of business areas between Boehringer Ingel-
heim and Sanofi).
• One unconsolidated affiliate company was liquidated.
The following subsidiaries were exempted from the reporting and disclosure obligations of Section 264 (3) HGB:
• Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Ingelheim
• Boehringer Ingelheim Europe GmbH, Ingelheim
• Boehringer Ingelheim Secura Versicherungsvermittlungs GmbH, Ingelheim
• Boehringer Ingelheim Grundstücksgesellschaft mbH, Ingelheim
• Boehringer Ingelheim Finanzierungs GmbH, Ingelheim
• Boehringer Ingelheim R&D Beteiligungs GmbH, Ingelheim
• Boehringer Ingelheim Venture Fund GmbH, Ingelheim
• Boehringer Ingelheim Invest GmbH, Ingelheim
The following subsidiary companies were exempt from the duty to prepare and disclose annual financial
statements and management reports in accordance with Section 264b HGB:
• C. H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Co. KG, Ingelheim
• C. H. Boehringer Sohn Grundstücksverwaltung GmbH & Co. KG, Ingelheim
• Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG, Ingelheim
• C. H. Boehringer Sohn Selbstmedikation GmbH & Co. KG, Biberach
• Boehringer Ingelheim Veterinary Research Center GmbH & Co. KG, Hanover
Two joint ventures acquired in the exchange of business areas between Boehringer Ingelheim and Sanofi
have not been included in the consolidated statements either using the proportionate method or the equity
method, since they are not material.
39CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES Boehringer Ingelheim 2017
In accordance with Section 311 (2) HGB, associated companies were also not included using the equity
method due the lack of significance.
1.4 Consolidation methods
For inventories and fixed assets, receivables, liabilities, and income and expense items, transactions between the
companies included in consolidation were eliminated as part of debt consolidation procedures in accordance
with Section 303 HGB, procedures to eliminate intercompany profits in accordance with Section 304 HGB,
and income and expenses consolidation procedures in accordance with Section 305 HGB.
The revaluation method was applied when including subsidiary companies in the consolidation for the first
time in accordance with Section 301 HGB. Companies were included in the consolidation for the first time
on the date at which the company became a subsidiary.
The carrying amount of the shares held by the parent company was offset against the corresponding equity
of the subsidiary. Equity is carried at the amount of the fair value of the assets, liabilities, prepaid expenses
and deferred income and special reserves included in the consolidated financial statements as at the time of
consolidation. Any remaining positive balance is recorded as goodwill; any remaining negative balance is
recorded as a difference from capital consolidation.
1.5 Currency translation
Assets and liabilities resulting from foreign currency transactions were translated using the average spot
exchange rate as at the balance sheet date. The realisation principle (Section 298 (1) in conjunction with
Section 252 (1) No. 4 half-sentence 2 HGB) and the historical cost convention (Section 298 (1) in conjunction
with Section 253 (1) sentence 1 HGB) were applied to items with a remaining term of more than one year.
In these consolidated financial statements, the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries domiciled in a
state outside the eurozone that are denominated in a foreign currency have been converted into euros in
accordance with Section 308a HGB using the modified closing date rate method.
Using the modified closing date rate method, the asset and liability items of the annual financial statements
prepared in foreign currency were translated into euros using the average spot exchange rate as at the balance
sheet date, with the exception of equity, which was translated using the historical rate. Items included in the
profit and loss statement were translated into euros using the average rate. The resulting translation difference
was reported within consolidated equity below the reserves in “Balance sheet currency conversion difference”.
For annual financial statements from countries with hyperinflation, significant foreign currency items were
translated with prior year exchange rates (temporal method) to improve the true and fair view of the Group’s
net assets, financial and earnings position.

2 Accounting policies
2.1 Fixed assets
Acquired intangible assets and tangible fixed assets are carried at cost, less scheduled straight-line amortisation
and depreciation determined under consideration of the technical and economic circumstances. This is based
on the following useful lives:
Intangible assets 2 to 15 years
Buildings 20 years
Technical equipment and machinery 10 years
Other equipment, operating and office equipment 3 to 10 years
Only straight-line depreciation and amortisation are used in the consolidated financial statements. Additional
write-downs are recorded to reflect impairments when the value of assets has been considered permanently
impaired. Production costs include materials and labour manufacturing costs, an appropriate portion of
materials and labour overheads, and the depreciation of fixed assets (to the extent caused by production).
All capitalised intangible assets have finite useful lives.
Financial assets primarily include shareholder rights, securities and loans and are carried at the lower of cost
or fair market value, if impaired.
41CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES Boehringer Ingelheim 2017
2.2 C urrent assets, prepaid expenses, deferred charges and exceeding amount of plan assets
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value.
Raw materials, consumables and supplies are capitalised at the lower of average acquisition prices or fair
market value on the balance sheet date.
Finished goods and work in progress are measured at production cost on the basis of individual calculations,
taking into account the directly attributable costs of materials, direct labour costs, special direct costs, and an
appropriate share of production and material overhead costs and depreciation.
Goods for resale are valued at the lower of either purchase cost or fair market value.
All identifiable risks in inventory assets arising from above-average storage periods, diminished marketability
and lower replacement costs were taken into account by recording appropriate valuation adjustments.
Inventories are valued loss-free, i. e. deductions were made from the expected sales prices to reflect costs yet
to be incurred.
Receivables and other assets were recognised at cost less allowances for specific risks and general credit risk.
Low-interest or non-interest-bearing receivables with a term of more than one year were discounted.
Securities classified as current assets include other securities and were recognised at the lower of cost or
quoted/market prices on the reporting date.
Cash and cash equivalents, consisting of cash, balances at banks and cheques, were recognised at the lower
of cost or fair market value.
Prepaid expenses recorded in accordance with Section 250 (1) HGB include expenses paid in advance in
respect of a defined period of time after the balance sheet date.
Deferred charges recorded in accordance with Section 250 (2) HGB include proceeds that represent income in
respect of a defined period of time after the balance sheet date.
The fair market value of plan assets and the corresponding present value of pension obligation have been
offset according to German GAAP. The exceeding amount of plan assets has been capitalised separately.
42PRODUCT PORTFOLIO
2.3 Difference from capital consolidation
The difference from capital consolidation reported on 31 December in the previous year resulted almost
exclusively from the acquisition of a US company in 2011. The original difference amounted to EUR 157 mil-
lion. The difference is amortised over an estimated period of ten years. The remaining balance of the difference
amounted to EUR 30 million at 31 December 2017; the reduction was due to the release of EUR 16 million
for the current period and due to the effect of changes in the exchange rate.
In addition, the only increase in the difference from capital consolidation reported on 31 December 2017 was
a result of the exchange of business areas between Boehringer Ingelheim’s consumer health care business
(CHC) and Sanofi’s animal health business (Merial), which was completed on 1 January 2017. In accordance
with the accounting policy selected by Boehringer Ingelheim on the application of exchange principles
(book value method), the acquisition cost of the shareholdings in the Merial companies acquired from
Sanofi is equal to the cash compensation, including the assumed obligations (EUR 4,970 million) plus the
carrying amount of the CHC business transferred in exchange (EUR 408 million). The proportional equity share
in the Merial companies at 1 January 2017 (EUR 7,364 million) corresponded t o the fair value of the acquired
assets and liabilities, after taking non-controlling interests into account. This resulted in a difference from
capital consolidation of EUR 1,986 million. The amortisation period for the difference on this transaction is
estimated to be 15 years. The remaining carrying amount of this difference at 31 December 2017, after the
release of EUR 287 million for the current financial year, amounted to EUR 1,699 million. The release for the
2017 financial year was influenced by one-off effects, primarily as a consequence of the tax reform in the USA.
The income from the release of the difference arising from capital consolidation is included in other operating
income. The release is made corresponding to the amortisation of those assets of the acquired company
identified in the purchase price allocation not previously recognised in that company’s balance sheet (“hid-
den assets”).
2.4 Group reserves
Group reserves include the retained earnings of the consolidated subsidiaries from prior and current years
and consolidation entries that affect earnings.
2.5 Provisions
Tax provisions and other provisions include all uncertain liabilities and expected losses from executory
contracts. They were carried at the amount required to settle the obligation based on reasonable prudent
commercial judgement (i. e. including future cost and price increases). Provisions with a remaining maturity
of more than one year were discounted using the matched-term, average market interest rate. In the case of
pension provisions this interest rate results from the last ten years and in the case of other provisions from
the last seven years (in accordance with the Rückstellungsabzinsungsverordnung – German Regulation on
the Discounting of Provisions)
2.6 Accounts payable and loans
Accounts payable and loans were recognised at settlement amount.
43CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES Boehringer Ingelheim 2017
2.7 Deferred taxes
To calculate deferred taxes arising from tax loss carry forwards or from temporary or quasi-permanent
differences between the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, prepaid expenses and deferred charges in the
commercial balance sheet and their carrying amounts for tax purposes, the amounts of the resulting tax
benefits and expenses at the time that the differences will reverse were measured using tax rates specific to the
respective consolidated company (4% to 39 %). Deferred tax balances are not discounted. Differences due to
consolidation measures in accordance with Sections 300 to 305 HGB were also measured using the company-
specific tax rates applicable at the time of the expected reversal of the difference. Deferred tax assets on loss
carryforwards were taken into account if it is likely that they will be used within the next five years.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities were reported without offsetting.
3 Explanation of the comparability of the
previous year’s figures
As a result of the exchange of our consumer health care business (CHC) for Sanofi’s animal health business
(Merial), there has been a significant change in the composition of the consolidated companies during the
financial year. In order to provide for better comparability in the consecutive consolidated financial statements,
significant balance sheet and profit and loss statement items are adjusted for the consumer health care
business that has been discontinued (2016) and for the newly acquired animal health business (2017).

* The numbers for the earnings of the CHC business unit are based on the management reporting of C. H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Co. KG. These diverge
from the actual transaction amounts; the difference is not significant.
44PRODUCT PORTFOLIO
In order to derive comparable figures for net sales in 2017, these must not only be adjusted for the newly
acquired animal health business but also for the sales governed by a transitional services and production
agreements as part of the transaction with Sanofi (TDSA/TSA).
For information on the performance of adjusted net sales, please refer to the statements in the report on eco-
nomic position in the management report.
Other operating expenses and income were, as in the previous year, subject to significant positive and negative
extraordinary and one-time effects, which means that a comparative presentation in a similar manner to the
net sales does not result in better comparability. With regard to the extraordinary and one-time effects, please
refer to chapter 5 in the notes.
The change in personnel expenses corresponded to the change in the number of employees. Overall, more
employees were transferred from Sanofi than were transferred out of the Group with the disposal of the
consumer health care business.
The cost of materials where, besides the increase from the newly aquired animal health business, subject to
exceptional effects which means that a comparative presentation in a similar manner to the net sales does
not result in better comparability. With regard to the exceptional effects, please refer to chapter 5 in the notes.
Besides the addition of the animal health business, which is more capital intensive than the CHC business,
the increase in the depreciation and amortisation of tangible and intangible fixed assets is primarily due to
the amortisation of intangible assets aquired within the transaction.

Provisions for pensions and similar obligations
The provisions for pensions and similar obligations were determined on the basis of actuarial calculations
using the projected unit credit method, taking into account future adjustments in salaries and pensions.
In addition to local biometric data (e.g. for Germany, mortality tables 2005 G published by Prof. Dr Klaus
Heubeck), pension obligations in the significant countries were calculated on the basis of the following
actuarial parameters:
(in % as of 31 December 2017) Germany USA Japan
Discount rate 3.68 4.46 1.41
Salary increase 3.50 4.00 2.0 – 4.18
Pension increase 1.88 3.00 0.00
Discounting rates were determined by reference to average market rates for 15-year maturities in accordance
with the German Regulation on the Discounting of Provisions of 11 March 2016. The interest rates used to
discount significant foreign pension obligations (USA and Japan) were determined with comparable parameters,
in line with the German Regulation on the Discounting of Provisions of 11 March 2016.
The difference calculated in accordance with Section 253 (6) HGB amounts to EUR 678 million.
The plan assets intended solely to cover pension and similar obligations that are unavailable to all other
creditors (plan assets as defined in Section 246 (2) sentence 2 HGB) were measured at fair market value,
which is essentially derived from stock market prices, and offset against the underlying pension and similar
obligations. The fair market value of the plan assets on the balance sheet date was EUR 1,624 million. The
related amount of pension obligations and similar obligations was EUR 5,901 million. Gains and losses from
plan assets and interest expense relating to pension and similar obligations were offset in accordance with
Section 246 (2) sentence 2 HGB. In total, EUR 195 million earnings from plan assets and EUR 495 million in
interest expense relating to pension and similar obligations are included in the financial result.
Tax provisions
The tax provisions also include provisions for double taxation risks, which have resulted following the imple-
mentation of the action plans of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as part
of their international initiative known as the “Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting” (BEPS).
Other provisions
Other provisions mainly include provisions for discounts and guarantees, provisions for litigation, legal
claims and compensation for damages, provisions for outstanding invoices, provisions for assumed risks in
the course of the business exchange with Sanofi as well as personnel-related provisions.

EUR 1,183 million, in particular as a result of the sale of a business in the USA in order to adjust the animal
health product portfolio for antitrust reasons, as well as due to the release of provisions.
Other operating income includes income from currency translation of EUR 1,040 million (previous year:

Current income taxes 2,333 1,160
Deferred taxes 752 — 217
3,085 943
The income tax expense was also affected by significant extraordinary effects. The tax expense for the current
period includes tax expenses arising from the disposal of the CHC business (approximately EUR 1.3 billion).
Moreover, in the USA, a tax reform was approved on 22 December 2017 through the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”.
This required the reassessment of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the corporate income tax rate enacted
into law as at the balance sheet date for future financial years. This also resulted in a significant increase in the
tax expense (EUR 583 million).
Current income taxes primarily include the corporation and trade tax expenses of the companies included in
consolidation.
The total balance of deferred tax assets at the balance sheet amounted to EUR 2,307 million (previous year:
EUR 2,420 million). Deferred tax assets primarily arise on the difference between the carrying amounts of
provisions for pension obligations and for discounts, tax goodwill and on fixed assets and inventories. Deferred
tax liabilities of EUR 754 million (previous year: EUR 296 million) were recorded. These primarily relate to
differences between the carrying amounts of intangible assets, tangible assets, inventories and provisions.

5.10 Group loss
The group loss for 2017 was positively influenced by prior-period operating income (primarily from the
reversal of other provisions) of EUR 724 million (previous year: EUR 381 million) and negatively influenced
by prior-period operating expenses of EUR 170 million (previous year: EUR 217 million).
6 Notes to the cash flow statement
The cash flow statement shows the changes in cash and cash equivalents (cash and long-term securities and
investments classified as current assets that can be sold at any time) of the Boehringer Ingelheim Group resulting
from cash in- and outflows in the reporting year. In accordance with German Accounting Standard on the
cash flow statement (DRS 21), the cash flow statement has been broken down according to cash flows from
operating activities and cash flows from investing and financing activities.
The changes in the balance sheet items of the affiliated companies included were translated using average
rates for the year. As on the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents are carried at the closing rate. The effect
of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents has been shown separately.
The financial funds also include financial assets with a remaining maturity in excess of three months on the
date of acquisition. These financial assets can be converted into cash in the short-term.
The financial funds as of 31 December 2017 comprised the following items:
(in millions of EUR) 2017
Cash and cash equivalents 3,071
Securities 0
Financial assets 5,059
8,130
The financial funds included EUR 162 million in restricted funds at the balance sheet date.
In the financial year, interest of EUR 20 million (previous year: EUR 99 million) was received and interest of
EUR 65 million (previous year: EUR 109 million) and taxes of EUR 2,106 million (previous year: EUR 987
million) were paid.

There are obligations from rental and lease agreements of EUR 445 million (previous year: EUR 276 million),
EUR 11 million of which (previous year: EUR 25 million) relate to long-term rental agreements with sub-
sidiaries not included in the consolidation.
The purpose of the lease agreements is the lower capital commitment compared to buying property and the
absence of the resale risk. Risks could arise from the term of the lease should it not be possible to continue to
utilise the properties fully, of which there are no indications at this time.
Other financial commitments include future expenses from follow-up investments, investments already
initiated and future major repairs. As at the balance sheet date, purchase commitments include future cash
flow effects of investments totalling EUR 1,120 million (previous year: EUR 258 million).
7.3 Derivative financial instruments and valuation units
Due to its extensive international structure, the Boehringer Ingelheim Group is highly dependent on devel-
opments in the world’s currencies and interest rates. To hedge these risks, particularly those emerging from
goods, services and financing, currency forwards and options are generally used for currency risks. Interest
rate swaps and options are used for interest rate risks.
The use of derivative financial instruments and the organisational processes are set out in internal guidelines.
There is a strict separation between trading, processing, documentation and control.
56PRODUCT PORTFOLIO
Risk positions are regularly tracked, analysed and measured in a special Group-wide financial report. The
positions entered into are periodically re-evaluated and monitored. The fair value of the derivative financial
instruments is calculated using generally accepted market valuation methods (currency forwards based on
the present value method) taking into account the market data as of the balance sheet date.
Provisions of EUR 72 million were recognised for currency forwards not included in hedge accounting for
which there was a negative fair value within one currency as at the balance sheet date. In line with the
imparity principle, positive fair values within one currency were not recognised.
On the balance sheet date, the derivative financial instruments not included in hedge accounting valuation
groups were as follows:
Nominal value Fair value
(in millions of EUR) 31.12.2017 31.12.2016 31.12.2017 31.12.2016
Foreign exchange forward contracts 4,105 2,892 — 23 — 35
To the extent that the requirements for hedge accounting of foreign currency forward exchange contracts with
highly probable forecasted transactions in accordance with Section 254 HGB were met, the foreign currency
forward exchange contracts were not recognised in the balance sheet in line with the net hedge presenta-
tion method.
The following accounting policies apply to the recognition of valuation groups in accordance with
S ection 254 HGB:
Economic hedges are accounted for in the financial statements by the use of valuation groups. The valuation
groups are recognised for each foreign currency based on the net amount of highly probable forecasted
transactions and currency forwards that match the forecasted net cash flow in terms of maturity, nominal
amount and foreign currency (macro hedge). The highly probable forecasted transactions (incoming and
outgoing payments for planned sales and purchases) are derived from company planning. Ex-post analysis
of planning has shown that the planned transactions are highly probable.
The opposing changes in value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument are fully offset as the critical
terms (maturity, nominal amount and foreign currency) match. An effective hedge can therefore be assumed
both prospectively and retrospectively. The critical term match method is exclusively used to measure the
prospective and retrospective effectiveness of hedges. Excess amounts under hedging transactions are not
included in the valuation groups.
57CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES Boehringer Ingelheim 2017
As of 31 December 2017, hedges for highly probable forecast net cash flows were recognised as follows:

For the years 2018 and 2019, there were also hedge accounting valuation groups from long and short posi-
tions of derivatives. The offsetting nominal values amount to +/– EUR 188 million from Japanese yen and
+/– EUR 3 million from US dollar.
58PRODUCT PORTFOLIO
Furthermore, as at 31 December 2017, valuation groups for foreign currency receivables were recognised as
follows:
Receivables (in millions of EUR) Forward exchange contracts (in millions of EUR)
Nominal value Nominal value Fair value
RUB 74 RUB — 64 RUB — 2
PLN 50 PLN — 9 PLN 0
The amount of the hedged foreign currency risk correlates to the relative change in the exchange rate
between the planning date and the realisation date of the forecast transactions. If all currencies were to
appreciate or depreciate against the euro by 10.0%, there would be a foreign currency risk of plus or minus
EUR 605 million without hedging.

Since the end of the 2017 financial year, we have not become aware of any events that are of material significance
to the Group or that could lead to a reappraisal of its net assets, financial position and earnings.

Total fees charged to the Group by the auditor for the financial year amounted to EUR 37.6 million.
EUR 3.2 million of this relates to audits of financial statements, EUR 1.8 million to other assurance services,

Qualified Audit Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Audit Opinion on the Group
Management Report
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of C. H. Boehringer Ingelheim Sohn AG & Co. KG,
Ingelheim, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at
31 December 2017, and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of changes in equity
and consolidated cash flow statement for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2017, and
notes to the consolidated financial statements, including the recognition and measurement policies
presented therein. In addition, we have audited the group management report of C.H. Boehringer Ingel-
heim Sohn AG & Co. KG for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2017.
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,
• except for the effects of the matter described in section „Basis for the Qualified Audit Opinion on the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the Audit Opinion on the Group Management Report“ the
accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the requirements
of German commercial law. The consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the
assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2017 and of its financial
performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2017 in compliance with German
Legally Required Accounting Principles, and
• the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s
position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the oppor-
tunities and risks of future development.
Pursuant to § [Article] 322 Abs. [paragraph] 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German
Commercial Code], we declare that, except for the qualification of the audit opinion on the consolidated
financial statements mentioned, our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance
of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.
Basis for the Qualified Audit Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Audit Opinion

Contrary to § 314 Abs. 1 Nr. [Number] 6 Buchstaben [letters] a) and b) HGB the total remuneration granted
to the members and the former members of the board of managing directors as well as the pension provisions
recognized and not recognized for the former members of the board of managing directors are not disclosed
in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
60PRODUCT PORTFOLIO
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in
accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany]
(IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management
Report” section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the
requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German pro-
fessional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified audit opinion on the consolidated
financial statements and for the audit opinion on the group management report.
Other Information
The executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the
annual report – excluding cross-references to external information – with the exception of the audited
consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor’s report.
Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not
cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to
consider whether the other information
• is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management
report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or
• otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
Responsibilities of the Executive Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group
Management Report
The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that
comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of German commercial law, and that the consoli-
dated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial
performance of the Group in compliance with German Legally Required Accounting Principles. In addi-
tion the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they, in accordance with German
Legally Required Accounting Principles, have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
61INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT Boehringer Ingelheim 2017
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based
on the going concern basis of accounting, provided no actual or legal circumstances conflict therewith.
Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report
that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects,
consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive
directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary
to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German
legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the
group management report.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group
Management Report
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group
management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material
respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the
audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and
risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material
misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on
the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.
62PRODUCT PORTFOLIO
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of
the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher
than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial
statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management
report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.
• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasona-
bleness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.
• Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to
the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or condi-
tions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.
• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with
German Legally Required Accounting Principles.
• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on
the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the
group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.
• Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements,

COPD is caused by continuous damage to the lungs result­

However, other factors also need to be considered

of COPD, which is a disease that occurs in the second
half in a human’s life, is characterised by an accelerated
loss of lung function compared to normal ageing and by
occasional sudden worsening of symptoms and function

Hypertension and cardiovascular diseases
Hypertension, also referred to as high blood pressure, is a
chronic disease in which the blood pressure is chronically
elevated. Hypertension is also one of the major risk factors
for stroke, heart attacks, heart failure and chronic renal
failure. The primary goal of any antihypertensive treatment
is to prevent such cardiovascular events and to reduce
cardiovascular mortality.
Acute myocardial infarction
An acute myocardial infarction, or heart attack, is an
event that occurs when a thrombus or clot suddenly pre­
vents blood flow to an area of the heart muscle. Unless
the blood flow is restored quickly, the affected section of
heart muscle becomes permanently damaged. Heart attack
is a leading cause of death in all developed countries.

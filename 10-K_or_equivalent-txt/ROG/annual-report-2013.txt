Dear Shareholders
In my last letter to you as Chairman, it gives me great pleasure to
report an excellent performance for the Roche Group in 2013.
In a challenging, increasingly cost-sensitive environment, our focus on
targeted medicines and diagnostic tests has allowed us to expand our
strong market position and to significantly improve net income. In light
of our strong performance, the Board of Directors is proposing – for
the 27 th consecutive year – an increase in dividend.

Pharmaceuticals Division, as CEO and as Chairman of the

At the forthcoming AGM, the Roche Board of Directors will
pro pose that Christoph Franz, who has served as a non- exec-

Chairman with outstanding personal qualities and an impres-

his extensive experience and exceptional worldwide network
will be great assets.

Healthcare varies dramatically from country to country.
In some countries, sophisticated medicines and tests are
widely available, whilst in others there is little or no basic
infrastructure. Even in established markets, medicines can
take years to become available to patients. Roche works
in partnerships all over the world to try to make a difference
and help break down the barriers to healthcare. We run
programmes tailored to specific local needs, whether to
support disease education, bring screening to remote
areas or make products affordable. A few examples of
these initiatives can be found in this Annual Report.

Early HIV diagnosis means babies can get the right treatment
and stay healthy. To this end, Roche has supported the intro-
duction of a new way of testing blood samples that are dried
on a card, but still able to be effectively tested for HIV. The
results process is a state-of-the-art procedure, with doctors
notified of the test results immediately. This collection card
has expanded access to HIV diagnosis, throughout the remot-
est areas of southern Africa, and Roche is continuing to work
with a number of other organisations in public private partner-
ships to ensure subsequent medical care for babies with HIV.

In response, governments are trying to adapt their healthcare
systems to tackle these healthcare needs, as well as keep costs
under control. Payers are playing a more central role in deter-
mining whether a medicine will make it to doctors and patients;
they are using more stringent criteria when deciding whether
to give a product the necessary financial support. Health Tech-

becoming increasingly important, as healthcare providers try

In the Philippines, the public healthcare system does not
cover the cost of all medicines. Patients often have to pay out
of their own pocket for treatment, especially for the most
sophisticated medicines, and for the majority, this is unaf-
fordable. To address this problem, Roche Philippines has
developed a socialised pricing programme that considers
the individual affordability level of a patient. When a doctor
prescribes one of our cancer medicines, an external agency
makes a financial assessment and a discount on the pre-
scribed medicine may be granted based on the patient’s
capacity to pay.

The combination of different cancer therapies is likely to play
a key role in the way we tackle cancer. At the moment, there is
evidence that one drug blocks a particular disease pathway
for a limited period of time before the cancer cells find new
pathways that allow them to continue growing. We are aiming to
cut off as many lifelines as possible for cancer cells by using
a number of different medicines to combat the disease. We hope
that this approach will reduce resistance and increase the

Data-sharing policy
In 2013, we introduced a new data sharing policy to promote
broad sharing of clinical trial data in the interest of scientific
progress, to benefit patients. Our policy includes provision of
clinical study reports, summary safety reports and access to
analysable patient-level data in a way that protects patient
confidentiality, respects the role of health authorities in the
assessment and approval of drugs and does not compromise
our commercial interests. We are working with other compa-
nies to develop a common approach for the sharing of patient
level data.
Animal welfare
We take public concern about animal research seriously and
throughout 2013 we have worked to maintain our already high
standards of animal welfare. Wherever possible, we seek alter-
natives to the use of animals, such as computer simulation or
in vitro testing using differentiated cells or stem cells.
In 2013, we used 356,394 animals in our internal research, a
13% decrease from 2012. The number of animals used by

Roche Business Report 2013 | Making innovation accessibleChina
Of the 350 million people chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV)

disease, cirrhosis, and primary liver cancer.

Bringing
state-of-the-art
therapy to patients
People with hepatitis are often unaware of their infection or
simply do not have access to treatment in China. In order to
help this situation, Roche has established diagnostic capacity
and medical training to improve know-how for wider access
to correct treatment regimes. Both our Pharmaceuticals and
Diagnostics Divisions work closely together to ensure the
right treatment is offered to the right patient. Given the preva-
lence of hepatitis B in China, it is vital to identify those patient
sub-groups most likely to benefit from a targeted therapy. As
a result, more and more patients see improved outcomes.
This integrated approach means the patient’s quality of life is
enormously improved and resources are used optimally.

Engaging with suppliers
We believe supplier engagement is critical for a number of
reasons: managing performance and risk effectively; ensuring
quality and compliance; reducing our combined environmental
footprint; and fostering innovation. To this end we have a num-
ber of initiatives in place to strengthen relationships with sup-
pliers. One example is the Roche Supplier Relationship Center
in South San Francisco, United States, which opened in 2012,
bringing together Roche procurement staff and five strategic
suppliers to seek opportunities for innovation, be they in prod-
uct development, new processes, recycling or risk reduction.

Affordability of treatment is a significant problem in Egypt, so
in order to address this in 2007 Roche introduced Pegferon,
a second brand of its hepatitis treatment, Pegasys. This is the
same medicine as the first brand, but is packaged locally in
vial form. This allows Roche to sell the medicine at a lower price
to the Government and as a result has increased access to
treatment all over the country. Roche completes this offer with
products for diagnosis and treatment monitoring, helping to
maximise medical service and patient benefit.

Roche is working to develop personalised reimbursement
models that reflect the value our treatments bring to patients.
Pilot projects are running in a number of countries to move
pricing from volume- to value-based pricing, where reimburse-
ment can vary depending on the indication or the combination
of medicines. This approach is in its early stages, with the
data systems and analytics systems still being developed, but
we believe it has enormous potential for patients, as well as
the healthcare industry as a whole.

Compensation
Compensation reinforces our culture of performance and plays
a key role in attracting, motivating and retaining top talent. Our
compensation principles focus on value creation, success shar-
ing, fairness and transparency, while balancing long- and short-
term remuneration with affordability and market competitive-
ness.
We spent 11.3 billion Swiss francs on remuneration (compen-
sation and benefits) in 2013. We also saw greater differentia-
tion in reward payments, reflecting our efforts to integrate
pay-for-performance principles and differentiated rewards
throughout the organisation. These efforts helped to establish
a common language and tools for performance appraisals and
compensation reviews across the organisation.
Improvements to compensation and performance management
were also facilitated by our online platform CHRIS, which is
now used by 196 affiliates. In 2013, Le Cercle SIRH, a French
association of HR and information system professionals,
granted the CHRIS team its HR Information System Strategy
award for a collaborative solution that harmonises HR pro-
cesses and improves HR management worldwide.

In 2013, the Children’s Walk celebrated its 10th anniversary. Since
2003, when about 1,000 employees from our Basel, Nutley and
Palo Alto sites joined the walk, the number of participants has
grown steadily, reaching 18,000 employees from 123 sites in
2013. All funds raised are matched by Roche.

Resource efficiency
and the environment
Our commitment
Using natural resources in a sustainable manner is fundamental
to Roche’s environmental strategy. The research and manufac-
ture of pharmaceutical and diagnostic products is dependent
on natural resources, such as raw materials, fuel and water.
Consequently, Roche is fully aware of its corporate responsi-
bility to a sustainable future and is committed to using natural
resources more efficiently. In doing so, the company decreases
its environmental footprint, which, in turn, benefits its stake-

Roche Annual Report 2013 | Safety, Security, Health and EnvironmentWater traps
At our Hillsboro site, in Oregon, USA, we estimate that a planned
water project will save approximately 19,000 cubic metres of
water annually. We will reduce water consumption by land-
scaping with soil containing crystals that consist of a super-
absorbent polymer. The ‘water crystals’ trap moisture, releasing
it into the soil when required. The crystals, which are planted
with new vegetation or tilled into planting beds, reduce run-
off from irrigation and rainfall and, in turn, the overall cost of
irrigation.

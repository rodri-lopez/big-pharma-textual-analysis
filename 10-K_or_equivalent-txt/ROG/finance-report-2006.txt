1) Continuing businesses.
The 2006 annual results once again show a strong operating performance both in terms of top-line sales growth
as well as profit margins, mainly driven by the Pharmaceuticals Division.
Total sales grew by 17% in local currencies (18% in Swiss francs; 18% in US dollars) to 42.0 billion Swiss francs,
with the Pharmaceuticals Division contributing 79% of Group sales and the Diagnostics Division representing
21%. The incremental sales increase of 6.5 billion Swiss francs was achieved through organic growth and
primarily driven by strong demand for the Group’s oncology drugs Herceptin, Avastin, MabThera/Rituxan and
Tarceva, by the anti-influenza drug Tamiflu, and by Bonviva/Boniva and Lucentis. This sales increase is after
absorbing over 500 million Swiss francs of lower Rocephin sales globally following the product’s US patent expiry
in July 2005.
The Group’s operating profit before exceptional items increased by 27% in local currencies to 11.7 billion
Swiss francs and the corresponding operating profit margin grew by 2.0 percentage points to 27.9%. This was
driven by an increase in Pharmaceuticals of 4.1 percentage points which more than offset a decline in the margin
in Diagnostics of 5.2 percentage points. This overall margin growth was achieved at the same time as the Group
continued to increase investments in the strong development pipeline and in launch and pre-launch activities.
The exchange rate impact on sales and operating profit growth as expressed in Swiss francs was moderate, with
Swiss-franc growth being 0 to 1 percentage point higher than local-currency growth. In 2006, the average
exchange rate for the US dollar was 1% higher and the euro was 2% higher, while the Japanese yen lost 5%.

Pharmaceuticals operating results
The Pharmaceuticals Division showed a strong sales increase, with growth of 21% in local currencies (22% in
Swiss francs; 21% in US dollars) to 33.3 billion Swiss francs, outpacing growth in the global market by a factor of
more than three. Operating profit before exceptional items was 10.5 billion Swiss francs, representing a growth
of 40% in local currencies. Consequently there was a further margin increase of 4.1 percentage points to 31.7%.
Marketing and distribution costs significantly increased by 17% in local currencies to 8.8 billion Swiss francs
reflecting the support for recently launched on-market products and pre-launch activities for global rollouts
and new indications. R&D investment in the pipeline continued with 5.9 billion Swiss francs of expenditure,
anincrease of 19% in local currencies.

Sales:The major growth drivers were the oncology, transplantation and virology franchises (including Tamiflu),
with the key oncology franchise again significantly outpacing the market. The renal anemia franchise declined
slightly due to biennial selling price cuts and a change in the reimbursement system for Epogin in the Japanese
market.

The growth and profitability of the Pharmaceuticals Division is primarily due to ten products (Herceptin, Avastin,
Tamiflu, MabThera/Rituxan, Lucentis, Tarceva, Bonviva/Boniva, Xeloda, CellCept and Xolair). These represent 59%
of the portfolio (2005: 47%; 2004: 37%). Together they grew 50% in 2006, generating over 6.5 billion Swiss francs
of additional sales. Overall the Top 20 products grew by 30% and of these only Rocephin was in real decline, due
to the US patent expiry in 2005. The decline of 6% for all other products is primarily due to generic erosion
affecting Copegus and Roaccutane.

6 Finance Report 2006Roche Group
Financial Review
MabThera/Rituxan:Sales growth was driven by higher sales volumes, particularly in Europe and the rest of the
world excluding the US and Japan (RoW). This is primarily due to increased usage of MabThera/Rituxan in first-
line treatment of indolent and aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). In the US, the already high treatment
rates for NHL were maintained and price increases in 2005 and 2006 also contributed to sales growth. Initial sales
were recorded for the treatment of the new rheumatoid arthritis indication in both US and Europe/RoW which
was an additional driver of the overall growth. Further growth potential is also expected from the maintenance
indication/treatment immediately following first-line therapy in indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Herceptin: Growth of the second highest selling product continued to be driven by increased market share in
HER2-positive adjuvant breast cancer (adj. BC) and the launch of this indication in additional countries. Roche
estimates that by the end of 2006, Herceptin had around 40% market share in adj. BC in the five key EU markets
(France, Germany, Italy, Spain and United Kingdom). Penetration rates in this setting outside these countries are
still considerably lower. In the US, growth rates appear to have flattened out due to the earlier and rapid adoption
of adjuvant treatment. Also contributing to growth, to a lesser extent, was a price increase effective in 2006.
Avastin: Sales continue to grow strongly, particularly in Europe/RoW where Avastin has now been launched in
most markets worldwide in the initial indication for first-line metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In the US,
Avastin has already achieved high penetration rates following its launch in early 2004. The continued US growth
is primarily driven by the usage of Avastin in first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) which was
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in combination with chemotherapy in October 2006,
and also by unapproved usage in metastatic breast cancer (mBC). There was also growth in 2006 from modest
increased usage in first-line mCRC. During 2006 Roche filed for first-line advanced NSCLC in Europe and firstline
mBC was filed in both the US and EU. Additional filings to enlarge the European first-line mCRC label to match
the broader US label are planned for the first half of 2007. A filing for the treatment of advanced renal cell
carcinoma (RCC) in Europe is scheduled for 2007.
Tamiflu:Sales continued to increase mainly due to government pandemic stockpiling which contributed 71% of
total sales. There was also an increase in retail sales related to pandemic preparedness. Seasonal sales were
lower than last year due to the absence of a severe flu season in the US, Europe and Japan during the calendar
year 2006. Significant pandemic orders are still due for delivery during 2007.
NeoRecormon/Epogin:Growth of NeoRecormon was driven by increased usage in both the oncology (+10%)
and renal anemia segments (+4%), which offset continued pricing pressure. Epogin sales in Japan declined due
to biennial selling price cuts and a change in the reimbursement system. Overall, sales of the anemia franchise
also slightly declined.
CellCept:Sales of the leading treatment in the mycophenolic acid (MPA) market were particularly strong in the
US, driven by transplant indications and increased usage in the treatment of certain autoimmune indications
(currently not approved). Continued sales growth in Western European countries offset the sales decline in some
Latin American countries where generic competition commenced.
Pegasys: With 53% market share, Pegasys remains the global market leader in the treatment of hepatitis C
(pegylated interferons). Sales were driven by increased use in Europe/RoW, offsetting a decline in the US from
an overall decline in market volume. In Japan sales declined due to competition from a combination treatment,
however the Pegasys+Copegus combination was approved in this market in January 2007.
Xeloda:The main growth driver was further increased usage of Xeloda for the treatment of both adjuvant colon
cancer and mCRC. A filing for gastric cancer was submitted in Europe. Filings to include further combinations on
the mCRC label, including use in combination with Avastin, are on track for the first half of 2007.
Tarceva:Sales continued to increase both in the US and in Europe/RoW, which now accounts for close to 40%
of overall sales just 14 months after obtaining approval. US sales were driven by approval in the second indication,
metastatic pancreatic cancer, as well as pricing increases in 2005 and 2006. In Europe Tarceva was approved for
the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer in January 2007.
Finance Report 2006 7Roche Group
Financial Review
Xolair:Sales growth was primarily driven by increased penetration in the asthma market and, to a lesser extent,
by pricing increases in 2005 and 2006. Outside the US, Xolair is marketed by Novartis. In the first half of 2007
Genentech expects to complete the acquisition of Tanox, its partner in the development of Xolair.
Bonviva/Boniva: The vast majority of sales come from the US, where Boniva has now captured approximately
15% market share (total prescriptions). Bonviva has been granted reimbursement and was launched in many
European markets during 2006.
Lucentis: Following US approval on 30 June 2006, initial sales were driven by high demand among existing
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients previously on other therapies and use by newly diagnosed
patients. Outside the US, Lucentis is marketed by Novartis.
Rocephin:Sales continued to decline rapidly in the US following the patent expiry in July 2005. As US sales are
now significantly lower, the marginal effect of the generic competition is now abating.
More information on the products and R&D pipeline can be found on page 27 of the Business Report.
Sales by region:Sales continued to grow in all major regions. In North America, sales grew more than three times
above the market, driven by products marketed by Genentech (Avastin, Herceptin, Lucentis, MabThera/Rituxan,
Tarceva and Xolair) as well as Tamiflu, Bonviva/Boniva, CellCept, Xeloda and Valcyte/Cymevene. Together these
more than compensated for the over 450 million Swiss francs decline in US sales of Rocephin following the US
patent expiry in July 2005. In Europe the Group continued to gain market share, driven by continuing strong sales
growth of Herceptin, Tamiflu, Avastin, MabThera/Rituxan, Tarceva, Pegasys, Xeloda and NeoRecormon. Sales in
Japan declined by 1% due to the biennial government-mandated price cuts effective 1 April 2006. There was
growth in Tamiflu sales in Japan, where government pandemic sales more than compensated for lower seasonal
flu sales. Sales growth for Herceptin, Neutrogin and Evista was mainly offset by a decline in Epogin sales. These
declined due to the biennial price cuts and new rules introducing flat-rate reimbursement for epoetin products
used in dialysis patients, which has reduced the size of the anemia market as a whole in Japan.

Japan 3,503 11 –1
Other regions 4,927 15 +24
Total 33,294 100 +21
Royalties and other operating income:The increase of 8% in local currencies was due to higher royalty income
and upfront income at Genentech and increased out-licensing income at Roche Pharmaceuticals. Gains on
product divestments were not significant at 16 million Swiss francs compared to 55 million Swiss francs in 2005.
Cost of sales: The increase of 11% in local currencies was significantly below the 21% increase in sales. This
is due to economies of scale in production and some product mix effects. In addition there are continuing
productivity improvements and benefits from concentrating on a smaller number of production sites. These
factors more than compensated for the 32% increase in royalty expenses on product sales to 1,714 million Swiss
francs from 1,294 million Swiss francs in 2005, driven by the success of MabThera/Rituxan, Tarceva, Xolair and
Tamiflu, and for the gross profit share to GlaxoSmithKline from increased Bonviva/Boniva sales.
8 Finance Report 2006Roche Group
Financial Review
Marketing and distribution:These costs increased by 17% in local currencies, which is lower than the growth
in sales in spite of the continuing intensive support for recent product launches and pre-launch activities for
upcoming launches. Significant investments were made in the US for Boniva and Lucentis, in Europe and RoW
markets for Avastin and Tarceva, and worldwide for Pegasys and for MabThera/Rituxan in its new indication,
rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, there were pre-launch costs in the US for Avastin for NSCLC and breast cancer
and for Mircera. In Japan, strategic marketing functions were strengthened and the sales force was significantly
increased by reorganising the specialised oncology/renal representatives. Additionally in Japan there was
preparation for the much earlier than originally anticipated launches of Avastin and Tarceva and also for the
launch of Actemra in rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, over the past 12 to 18 months Roche has established
a number of new affiliates in Central and Eastern Europe. Costs relating to Tamiflu increased to properly
communicate its role in both seasonal flu and pandemic planning. Marketing and distribution costs as a
percentage of sales were 26.3% compared to 27.4% in 2005.
Research and development:The increase of over 900 million Swiss francs, or 19% in local currencies, to almost
5.9 billion Swiss francs reflects higher spending on both late-stage clinical trials and early-stage projects. This is
driven by the many additional indications, in particular for the oncology portfolio and for MabThera/Rituxan and
Actemra in rheumatoid arthritis. Research and development costs as a percentage of sales were 17.7% compared
to 18.2% in 2005. In addition Roche spent almost 600 million Swiss francs on the in-licensing of pipeline
compounds and technologies, which are capitalised as intangible assets as required by IFRS. In total Roche spent
6.5 billion Swiss francs on internal and purchased R&D from in-licensing and other alliance deals, representing
19.4% of sales and an increase of 22% in local currencies.
General and administration: These costs grew by 3% in local currencies. Favourable developments included
lower restructuring costs, in particular at Chugai, and gains made on the disposal of property. Overall these
compensated for the costs for a project to harmonise SAP systems across Europe and establish a shared service
centre for European affiliates, for higher royalty expenses on royalty income at Genentech and for the creation of
new affiliates in Central and Eastern Europe.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets:The decline of 3% in local currencies primarily arose from
Genentech, as some intangible assets were fully amortised by mid-2005. An impairment charge of 13 million
Swissfrancs was recorded in the second half of 2006, which relates to the decision to terminate development of
one compound with an alliance partner.

Finance Report 2006 9Roche Group
Financial Review
Within the Pharmaceuticals Division, Roche Pharmaceuticals showed a very strong performance with a sales
increase of 20% in local currencies, an increase in operating profit of 29% in local currencies, and an increase
in the operating profit margin of 2.0 percentage points to 29.2% of sales. Economies of scale, a favourable
product mix development and lower cost ratios in marketing and distribution, research and development and
general and administration offset the impact of higher royalty expenses and an increased gross profit share
to GlaxoSmithKline following higher Bonviva/Boniva sales. At Genentech, overall costs grew less than the
significantly increased sales. Additionally, Genentech received considerably higher royalty income from Roche
Pharmaceuticals due to the sales success of Herceptin, Avastin, MabThera/Rituxan and Tarceva. As a
consequence the operating profit margin improved by 11.2 percentage points to 43.3%. Chugai reported
slightly lower sales in local currencies, mainly as a result of government price cuts. Increased Tamiflu sales
from government pandemic planning did not fully offset the impact of these price cuts. Operating profit
at Chugai declined by 228 million Swiss francs due to the price cuts and Epogin reimbursement changes
mentioned previously and also due to the marketing activities described above. Additional information on the
Pharmaceuticals Division’s sub-divisional results is given in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
andfurther information on Genentech and Chugai is given in Notes 4 and 5.
Diagnostics operating results
The Diagnostics Division increased its sales to 8.7 billion Swiss francs, growing by 5% in local currencies (6% in
Swiss francs; 5% in US dollars) while maintaining its leading market position. The operating profit before exceptional
items decreased by 21% in local currencies to 1,422 million Swiss francs. Although there was a margin decline of
5.2 percentage points to 16.3%, the cash generation of the business remains well above industry average with an
EBITDA of 28.6%. The lower margin was primarily due to further investments in product launches and continued
selling price pressure, combined with impairment charges on intangible assets (2.1% of sales) in the second half of
2006. Additionally, 2006 royalty and other operating income was substantially lower, mainly due to the expiry of some
PCR-related patents during 2006 and certain one-time income in 2005. Despite the decline in the operating margin
in 2006, it remains above the average of the division’s major competitors.

Sales: The major driver of sales growth was again Centralized Diagnostics (Immunodiagnostics), with Applied
Science and Near Patient Testing also delivering solid performances. The continued rollout of products, in
particular the rejuvenated Diabetes Care portfolio, combined with the recently launched cobas modular platforms
in Centralized Diagnostics, helped strengthen Roche’s position in all market segments and led to the increase in
growth in the second half of 2006.

Diabetes Care: Diabetes Care maintained its number one position in blood glucose monitoring with sales of
3.0billion Swiss francs, an increase of 3% in local currencies, following a rebound in growth in the second half
of the year. Sales of Accu-Chek blood glucose monitoring meters, strips and lancets increased by 3% in local
currencies to 2.8 billion Swiss francs, while insulin delivery sales grew by 11% to 206 million Swiss francs. Global
rollout of the new portfolio was completed mid-2006 with the launch of the Accu-Chek Compact Plus in the US
and Canada and the Accu-Chek Aviva in Japan. The new Accu-Chek Aviva meter experienced rapid uptake in all
markets where launched and reversed the sales decline from the maturation of the Accu-Chek Advantage line.
Accu-Chek Compact Plus continues to expand the new ‘integrated’ market segment where it commands a 70%
share and remains the only meter on the market integrating measuring, test strip and lancet in one device. In
October 2006 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lifted an import alert barring the sale of Accu-Chek
insulin pumps in the United States, allowing Roche to immediately re-enter the world’s largest infusion systems
market.
Centralized Diagnostics:Sales increased by 5% in local currencies to 3.1 billion Swiss francs, further increasing
Roche’s lead in this highly competitive segment. Immunochemistry sales grew significantly above the market rate
for the sixth successive year, with a growth of 13% to 1.2 billion Swiss francs. Significant immunochemistry
instrument placements in 2005, combined with the increasing demand for the cardiac test Elecsys proBNP, is now
resulting in strong reagent sales. Sales in clinical chemistry increased in volume, however the ongoing price
pressure in this segment meant that sales declined by 1%, in a flat market. The launch in mid-2006 of the cobas
6000 analyser series, for labs with medium workloads, was the first in a series of the modular platform designed
to integrate and improve the efficiency of clinical chemistry and immunochemistry testing in different sized
laboratories, and will strengthen our product offering in this important market segment.
Molecular Diagnostics: Molecular Diagnostics remained the clear market leader with sales of 1.2 billion
Swissfrancs and growth of 3% in local currencies. Sales in virology grew by 5% in local currencies to 559 million
Swiss francs in a flat market, supported by the new automated platforms which helped combat pricing pressure
in this highly competitive segment. Blood screening showed evidence of slowing growth (sales 310 million Swiss
francs, a decrease of 1% in local currencies) with an increase in the number of centres coming online offset by a
price reduction in Japan earlier in the year. In June 2006 Roche began rolling out across Europe the new fully
automated cobas s 201 modular blood screening system and cobas TaqScreen MPX multiplex test, which
simultaneously detects HIV, HCV and HBV in donated blood or plasma. Roche is on track to submit filings to the
FDA in the first half of 2007 for tests to detect and genotype low and high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV).
Near Patient Testing: Sales rose 7% to 785 million Swiss francs, helped by improved marketing of the business
area’s broad portfolio and by the continued move towards decentralised testing. Coagulation sales increased
by6% in local currencies to 196 million Swiss francs, due to the growing trend towards patient self-monitoring.
The new coagulation monitoring systems, CoaguChek XS for patient self-monitoring and CoaguChek XS Plus
forhealthcare professionals, commenced their European rollout in January and October, respectively, and a full
US launch of the CoaguChek XS for professional use is planned for the first quarter of 2007.
Applied Science:In a highly fragmented and competitive life science market, Applied Science grew at 12% to
632 million Swiss francs, this being twice the market rate. The major contributors were sales of the Genome
Sequencer 20 system (for DNA sequencing), the LightCycler 480 system (for high-throughput real-time PCR)
andthe industrial business (reagents for industrial processes).

Sales by regions: Sales continued to grow ahead of the local market in all regions with the exception of
NorthAmerica. North America returned to positive growth in the second half of 2006, helped by Immunochemistry
and the rebound in Diabetes Care. Sales growth in Japan was particularly strong given the across-the-board price
cut of 10% in April.

Royalties and other operating income: At 189 million Swiss francs, royalty and other operating income was
31% in local currencies or 82 million Swiss francs lower than in the comparative period which included substantial
one-off income from out-licensing agreements. Royalty income in 2006 was lower due to the expiry in March 2006
of the foundational PCR patents in most countries outside the US. In the US, the patents expired in March 2005.
Cost of sales: The overall increase of 13% in local currencies was considerably higher than sales growth. This
was a result of business area mix and product mix impacts and higher depreciation resulting from the significantly
increased leased-out instruments base. Royalty expenses of 263 million Swiss francs in 2006 were 10% higher
inlocal currencies primarily due to Centralized Diagnostics. Cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased to
42.8% from 39.5% in 2005.
Marketing and distribution: These costs remained stable at the 2005 level with increased overall investment
in 2006 offset by the significant launch expenses for a number of new Diabetes Care products in the 2005
comparative numbers. In addition, sample consumption and inventory write-offs were lower in 2006, and some
global functions across the division and business areas were streamlined. Marketing and distribution as a
percentage of sales declined to 24.0% from 24.9% in 2005.
Research and development:Costs decreased slightly by 1% in local currencies. The decline reflects changes
in the timing of projects and lower expenses from third-party collaborations. As a percentage of sales, research
and development costs declined to 8.0% from 8.5% in 2005.
General and administration:These costs increased by 12% in local currencies, mainly due to increased accruals
for prior year royalties following from ongoing discussions with various contract partners. In addition there were
restructuring expenses of 17 million Swiss francs.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets:The increase is due to impairment charges of 184 million
Swiss francs recorded in the second half of 2006, following updating of the division’s business plans and
technology assessments. These charges mainly relate to intangible assets recorded from the Disetronic
acquisition in 2003.
Corporate operating costs
General and administration: Costs increased to 237 million Swiss francs (121 million Swiss francs in 2005),
which is explained by the inclusion in the 2005 results of a gain of 127 million Swiss francs from the settlement
of pension plans at Chugai. Excluding this, corporate operating costs declined by 4%.

Operating profit: The increase of 2,897 million Swiss francs or 33% in local currencies reflects the strong
business expansion, the continued improvement in the Group’s operating performance and the inclusion of
exceptional items for major legal cases in the comparative 2005 results.
Non-operating results
During 2006 the Group’s treasury operations and pension management delivered a positive net financial income,
with net income from financial assets and foreign exchange management exceeding financing costs by
855million Swiss francs. The Group’s effective tax rate increased by 2.4 percentage points to 27.3% from 24.9%,
mainly due to an increase in the effective tax rate at Genentech. Profit from continuing businesses and net income
increased due to the combination of positive developments on the operating and financial lines and the absence
of major legal case expenses in 2006, which more than compensated for the increase in the effective tax rate.

Finance Report 2006 13Roche Group
Financial Review
Financial income: Financial income showed a strong increase compared to 2005. Net income from equity
securities was 390 million Swiss francs compared to 258 million Swiss francs in 2005, driven by strongly
performing equity markets during 2006 and the disposal of some equity investments. Interest income and income
from debt securities almost doubled to 780 million Swiss francs due to higher holdings and increases in interest
rates. Expected returns on pension plan assets were 636 million Swiss francs, in line with 2005. Net foreign
exchange losses were 24 million Swiss francs compared to losses of 34 million Swiss francs in 2005. A full analysis
of financial income is given in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Financing costs:Financing costs were 974 million Swiss francs and declined by 1% compared to 2005. Interest
expenses increased as a result of the 2 billion US dollar Senior Notes issued at Genentech in mid-2005. This was
only partly compensated by lower interest expenses resulting from the partial conversion of ‘LYONs V’ notes and
some bank debt redemption. As most debt instruments are fixed, increasing interest rates did not have a major
impact on financing costs. Interest costs of defined benefit plans were 571 million Swiss francs, slightly lower
than2005. A full analysis of financing costs is given in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income taxes:The Group’s effective tax rate was 27.3% compared to the 2005 rate of 24.9%. The main influence
was the increase in the effective tax rate at Genentech (to 42% from 36%). As in the 2006 interim results,
the accounting for equity compensation plans adversely affected the effective tax rate at Genentech, as the
development of the Genentech share price in 2006 meant that only a small accounting tax benefit was recorded
from the expensing of equity compensation plans. In addition the 2005 tax charge at Genentech includes certain
tax credits. Excluding Genentech and Chugai, the underlying effective tax rate of 18.9% is slightly lower than the
2005 rate of 20.2%. An analysis of the effective tax rate is given in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Profit from continuing businesses:The increase of 33% compared to 2005 is due to the positive developments
in the operating and financial lines. Excluding the 2005 exceptional item major legal cases, profit from continuing
businesses increased by 2.1 billion Swiss francs or 29%.
Discontinued businesses:There were no significant results from discontinued operations, with 2006 showing
a small release of provisions that are no longer required. The comparative results include the operating results
for the remaining 2% of the Consumer Health (OTC) business that was transferred to Bayer in 2005. Further
information about discontinued businesses is given in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net income: In 2006 Group net income increased by 34% to 9.2 billion Swiss francs and the return on sales
margin was 21.8%. Net income attributable to the Roche shareholders was 33% higher than in the comparative
period. The share of net income attributable to minorities increased by 37% to 1,291 million Swiss francs due to
the continually improving profit contribution by Genentech. Within this, 1,077 million Swiss francs are attributable
to Genentech minority interests and 202 million Swiss francs to Chugai minority interests.

A full consolidated cash flow statement is given on page 25 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Operating cash flows:The Group’s business operations continued to show strong cash generation of 16.0 billion
Swiss francs, driven by continued growth in EBITDA. The development of the business led to an increase in
working capital, mainly in inventories and trade receivables. In particular there were increases at Genentech and
from the growth in the business in Central and Eastern Europe. Income tax payments increased due to payments
made by Genentech and Chugai. In total, operating cash flows after taxes increased by 4% to 10.3 billion
Swissfrancs.
Investing cash flows: The largest investing cash flows in 2006 are for expenditure on property, plant and
equipment of 3.6 billion Swiss francs, particularly for biotechnology manufacturing facilities, and a net
reinvestment of cash into marketable securities of 4.5 billion Swiss francs. The comparative 2005 cash flows
include the receipt from Bayer of 2.9 billion Swiss francs proceeds from the divestment of the Consumer Health
(OTC) business and the 0.5 billion Swiss francs used by Genentech to purchase the Oceanside biologics
manufacturing facility.
Financing cash flows: Significant financing cash flows in 2006 and 2005 relate to dividend payments and the
redemption of debt instruments. Dividends paid by Roche in 2006 were 2.2 billion Swiss francs (2005: 1.7 billion
Swiss francs) and cash used for the redemption of debt instruments was 1.3 billion Swiss francs (used to purchase
equity instruments to cover partial conversion of the ‘LYONs V’ notes) compared to 1.2 billion Swiss francs in 2005
(used for the ‘Sumo’ bonds). Following the partial conversion of the ‘LYONs V’ notes the Group reduced its own
equity instruments holdings in 2006, realising a cash inflow of 1.4 billion Swiss francs. In 2005 Genentech issued
2 billion US dollars of Senior Notes resulting in a cash inflow equivalent to 2.6 billion Swiss francs. In 2006
Genentech received 0.5 billion Swiss francs from stock option exercises (2005: 1.0 billion Swiss francs) in 2006
and repurchased shares for 1.2 billion Swiss francs (2005: 2.5 billion Swiss francs).

Non-current assets: The decrease in the US dollar to 1.22 against the Swiss franc at 31 December 2006 from
1.31 at 31 December 2005 decreased long-term assets in Swiss franc terms since many of the Group’s production
facilities and intangible assets are denominated in US dollars. This was offset by capital expenditure of 4.5 billion
Swiss francs.
16 Finance Report 2006Roche Group
Financial Review
Current assets:Inventories and accounts receivable were higher in local currencies following from the growth
of the business. The total balance of cash and marketable securities increased by 3.4 billion Swiss francs as a
result of the Group’s strong cash generation.
Debt: The partial conversion of the ‘LYONs V’ notes and the further repayment of bank loans reduced debt by
1.4 billion Swiss francs. The remaining 0.6 billion Swiss francs carrying value of the ‘LYONs V’ notes is now
classified as short-term debt, due to the Group’s option to redeem the notes from 25 July 2007 onwards.
Additionally the movement in the US dollar exchange rate decreased the Swiss franc carrying value of the Group’s
US dollar-denominated debt instruments.
Other non-current and current liabilities:There were no significant movements in the overall balance in local
currencies, with most of the movement being due to currency translation or transfers between current and non-
current liabilities.
Total net assets/equity: The most significant movements were the net income of 9.2 billion Swiss francs, the
Roche dividend payments of 2.2 billion Swiss francs and currency translation losses of 1.5 billion Swiss francs.
The currency translation losses mainly arose from the decrease in the US dollar relative to the Swiss franc, which
particularly affects the balance sheet values of assets and liabilities that have concentrations in the US, such as
property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets and debt.
Strong financial condition: The Group remains solidly financed, with equity (including minority interests)
representing 63% of total assets and 83% of total assets financed long-term.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefit plans are classified as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions
into a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation
to pay further contributions. In 2006 expenses for the Group’s defined contribution plans were 214 million Swiss
francs (2005: 174 million Swiss francs), the increase arising mainly from Genentech. All other plans are classified
as ‘defined benefit plans’, even if the Group’s potential obligation is relatively minor or has a relatively remote
possibility of arising. The funding and asset management of the Group’s various defined benefit plans is overseen
at a corporate level. Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by payments
from the Group and by employees, but in some cases the plan is unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired
employees directly from its own financial resources.

Unfunded plans
– Defined benefit obligation (3,596) (3,630)
Funding status: Overall the Group’s defined benefit plans continue to be adequately funded, with the main
movements arising from better than expected returns on plan assets and currency translation effects from plans
denominated in US dollars and euros. The funding status increased to 106% from 99%. An increase in the
discount rates used in the 2006 valuations of Eurozone plans reduced the defined benefit obligations slightly.
Finance Report 2006 17Roche Group
Financial Review
Expenses recorded in income statement: Pension expenses in 2006 relating to the Group’s defined benefit
plans were 283 million Swiss francs, more than double the 2005 expenses of 117 million Swiss francs. This is
mainly due to the one-time settlement gain in 2005 of 127 million Swiss francs that arose when Chugai returned
part of its employees’ pension fund to the Japanese government. Excluding this, pension costs in 2006 increased
by 16% mainly due to changes in discount rates adopted at the end of 2005. The revised actuarial assumptions
included in the actuarial valuations at the end of 2006 are expected to lead to further increases in 2007, which
partly arise from increased life expectancy.
Full details of the Group’s pensions and other post-employment benefits are given in Note 13 to the Consolidated

Dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing a 36% increase in the dividend for 2006 to 3.40 Swiss francs per share and
non-voting equity security (2005: 2.50 Swiss francs) for approval at the Annual General Meeting. This is the 20th
consecutive increase in the dividend. If the dividend proposal is approved by shareholders, dividend payments on
the shares and non-voting equity securities in issue will amount to 2.9 billion Swiss francs (2005: 2.2 billion Swiss
francs), resulting in a payout ratio of 38% (2005: 36%). Based on the prices at year-end 2006, the dividend yield
on the Roche share is 1.4% (2005: 1.1%) and the yield on the non-voting equity security is 1.6% (2005: 1.3%).

Financial risks
Value-at-Risk and Earnings-at-Risk analysis tools
The Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculations are used to indicate the ranges within which the value of the respective
assets or liabilities may fluctuate with a certain probability over a certain time period (holding period). The VaR
measure is a statistical measure, implicitly assuming that the value changes of the recent past are indicative of
value changes in the future. Market shocks are included in this calculation to the extent that they occurred in the
observation period. The Group uses statistically relevant observation periods and applies holding periods, which
reflect the time period required to change the respective risk exposure if deemed appropriate. With longer holding
periods, the probability of higher value changes increases and so does the VaR measure.
Earnings-at-Risk (EaR) is equivalent to the VaR methodology, but rather than potential value changes, it indicates
the potential changes to profits (losses) with a certain probability and over a certain time period. The same
constraints and limitations apply to this methodology.
All VaR and EaR figures for interest rate risks are measured using a historical simulation approach. For each
historical scenario (representing all price and rate changes of all individual instruments over a specific 20-day
period in the past 10 years), all financial instruments are fully revalued (using valuation models) and the total
change in value and earnings is determined. All VaR and EaR calculations below are based on a 95% confidence
level and a holding period of 20 trading days.
The Group cannot predict future market movements. The VaR and EaR figures given below do not represent the
actual losses which are expected or might be incurred on financial assets and liabilities, nor the possible worst
loss over the period stated, nor do they consider the effect of favourable changes in market rates.

On average in 2006 the US dollar and the euro slightly strengthened against the Swiss franc compensating for
the weaker yen. Consequently there is almost no difference between sales growth and operating profit growth
expressed in Swiss francs or in local currencies. In absolute terms, the sensitivity of Group sales of continuing
businesses to a movement in the US dollar against the Swiss franc of 0.01 Swiss francs during 2006 was
approximately 130 million Swiss francs, and the corresponding sensitivities for the euro and yen were
approximately 70 million Swiss francs and 35 million Swiss francs respectively.
In 2006 the Group further pursued a strategy to continuously lock in favourable developments of foreign exchange
rates by entering into derivative contracts. Due to increased hedging activities associated with the strong sales
growth of the Group, the foreign exchange transaction VaR increased compared to a very low exposure at year
end 2005. In absolute terms it still remained at a low level.

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could have adverse effects on the Group’s net
income or financial position. Changes in interest rates cause variations in interest income and expenses on
interest-bearing assets and liabilities. In addition, they can affect the market value of certain financial assets,
liabilities and instruments. Where appropriate, the Group uses financial derivatives such as swaps to manage its
interest rate risk.
During 2006 the Group unwound most of its fair value hedges on its fixed-rate capital market debt, leading to an
increased interest rate VaR. The effect was partly compensated by a debt reduction of 1.4 billion Swiss francs due
to the redemption of outstanding bank debt and partial conversion of LYONs V convertible notes. The effect of
higher liquid funds on interest rate VaR was small, as most instruments have a short duration.
The comparatively small risks from re-pricing or re-financing were contained at reasonable levels. However
Earnings-at-Risk (EaR) has increased mainly as a result of more liquid funds held with short interest rate
commitments and because of the generally higher interest rate levels, which allow more room for downward
changes in interest rates.

Financial Review
Market risk of financial assets and liabilities
Changes in the market value of financial assets and liabilities can affect the net income or financial position of
the Group. Market risk arises from movements in stock prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates.
The Group’s financial assets are mostly held in highly liquid bonds and money market instruments. The equity
allocation in the Group’s portfolio of cash and marketable securities is 0.9 billion Swiss francs, or 4% of total cash
and marketable securities. This figure remained stable compared to 2005 (0.8 billion Swiss francs, or 4% of total
cash and marketable securities).
International Financial Reporting Standards
The Roche Group has been using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to report its consolidated
results since 1990. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has published a number of new and
revised standards and interpretations that first became effective in 2006, which the Group implemented from
1January 2006. The only significant changes that relate to the Roche Group financial statements arise from IAS19
(revised) ‘Employee benefits’, in particular with respect to defined benefit pension and other post-employment
benefits. These changes have been implemented effective 1 January 2006 and the comparative 2005 results
havebeen restated for these changes from those previously published.
Defined benefit plans – Actuarial gains and losses: All actuarial gains and losses are now recognised
immediately and recorded directly to equity. Previously actuarial gains and losses below a certain threshold were
not recognised and those above this threshold were only recognised progressively. As a result of this change the
Group’s consolidated balance sheet more accurately represents the funding status of the various plans.
Defined benefit plans – Expected return on plan assets and interest cost: The Group now reports the
expected return on plan assets and interest costs from defined benefit plans as part of financial income and
financing costs, respectively. Previously these were reported as part of the divisional operating results. This
change in presentation aligns the reporting of the Group’s results more closely with its internal management and
organisation structure.
Full details of the changes are given in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Supplementary
presentation materials from the investor update held on 7 June 2006 are available on the ‘Investor Relations’
section of the Group’s website at www.roche.com.

Finance Report 2006 27Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Reference numbers indicate corresponding Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of the Roche Group have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. They have been prepared using the historical
cost convention except that, as disclosed in the accounting policies below, certain items, including derivatives
and available-for-sale investments, are shown at fair value. They were approved for issue by the Board of
Directors on 1 February 2007 and are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on
5March 2007.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure
ofcontingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. If in the future such estimates and assumptions,
which are based on management’s best judgement at the date of the financial statements, deviate from the actual
circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the year in which the
circumstances change.
Changes in accounting policies that arise from the application of new or revised standards and interpretations
are applied retrospectively, unless otherwise specified in the transitional requirements of the particular standard
or interpretation. Retrospective application requires that the results of the comparative period and the opening
balances of that period are restated as if the new accounting policy had always been applied. In some cases the
transitional requirements of the particular standard or interpretation specify that the changes are to be applied
prospectively. Prospective application requires that the new accounting policy only be applied to the results of
the current period and the comparative period is not restated. In addition comparatives have been reclassified or
extended from the previously reported results to take into account any presentational changes.
Consolidation policy
These financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, a company registered
in Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’).
The subsidiaries are those companies controlled, directly or indirectly, by Roche Holding Ltd, where control is
defined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits
fromits activities. This control is normally evidenced when Roche Holding Ltd owns, either directly or indirectly,
more than 50% of the voting rights or potential voting rights of a company’s share capital. Special Purpose Entities
are consolidated where the substance of the relationship is that the Special Purpose Entity is controlled by
theGroup. Companies acquired during the year are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to
the Group, and subsidiaries to be divested are included up to the date on which control passes from the Group.
Inter-company balances, transactions and resulting unrealised income are eliminated in full.
Investments in associated companies are accounted for by the equity method. These are companies over which
the Group exercises, or has the power to exercise, significant influence, but which it does not control. This is
normally evidenced when the Group owns 20% or more of the voting rights or potential voting rights of the
company. Balances and transactions with associated companies that result in unrealised income are eliminated
to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associated company. Interests in joint ventures are reported using the
line-by-line proportionate consolidation method.
Segment reporting
The Group’s primary format for segment reporting is business segments and the secondary format is geographical
segments. The risks and returns of the Group’s operations are primarily determined by the different products that
the Group produces rather than the geographical location of the Group’s operations. This is reflected by the
Group’s management and organisational structure and internal financial reporting systems.
28 Finance Report 2006Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The determination of the Group’s business and geographical segments is based on the organisation units for
which information is reported to the Group’s management. The Group has two divisions, Pharmaceuticals
and Diagnostics. Within the Pharmaceuticals Division there are three sub-divisions, Roche Pharmaceuticals,
Genentech and Chugai. The three sub-divisions have separate management and reporting structures within the
Pharmaceuticals Division and are considered separately reportable business segments. The Vitamins and Fine
Chemicals business and the Consumer Health (OTC) business were previously separately reportable business
segments. These have been divested and are presented as discontinued businesses. Certain headquarter
activities are reported as ‘Corporate’. These consist of corporate headquarters, including the corporate executive
committee, corporate communications, corporate human resources, corporate finance, including treasury, taxes
and pension fund management, corporate legal and corporate safety and environmental services. The Group’s
geographical segments are determined by geographical location and similarity of economic environments.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm’s length basis. Divisional assets and liabilities
consist of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade receivables/payables and
inventories. Other segment liabilities consist of other liabilities, such as provisions, which can be reasonably
attributed to the reported business segments. Non-segment assets and liabilities mainly include current and
deferred income tax balances, post-employment benefit assets/liabilities and financial assets/liabilities. These
are principally cash, marketable securities, other investments and debt. Capital expenditure comprises additions
to goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, including those arising from business
combinations.
Foreign currency translation
Most Group companies use their local currency as their functional currency. Certain Group companies use other
currencies (namely US dollars, Swiss francs or euros) as their functional currency where this is the currency
of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Local transactions in other currencies are
initially reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses from the settlement of
such transactions and gains and losses on translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other
currencies are included in income, except when they are qualifying cash flow hedges or arise on monetary items
that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign entity, which are deferred into equity.
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using functional currencies other than Swiss francs
(foreign entities) are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange. Sales, costs, expenses,
net income and cash flows are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Translation differences
due to the changes in exchange rates between the beginning and the end of the year and the difference between
net income translated at the average and year-end exchange rates are taken directly to equity. On disposal of a
foreign entity, the identified cumulative currency translation differences within equity relating to that foreign
entity are recognised in income as part of the gain or loss on divestment.
Revenues and cost of sales
Sales represent amounts received and receivable for goods supplied to customers after deducting trade
discounts, cash discounts and volume rebates, and exclude sales and value added taxes. Revenues from the sale
of products are recognised upon transfer to the customer of significant risks and rewards. Trade discounts, cash
discounts and volume rebates are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of the related
sales. Estimates of expected sales returns, charge-backs and other rebates, including Medicaid in the United
States and similar rebates in other countries, are also deducted from sales and recorded as a deduction from
accounts receivable or as accrued liabilities or provisions. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing
contractual or legislatively-mandated obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience. Other revenues
are recorded as earned or as the services are performed. Where necessary, single transactions are split into
separately identifiable components to reflect the substance of the transaction. Conversely, two or more
transactions may be considered together for revenue recognition purposes, where the commercial effect
cannot be understood without reference to the series of transactions as a whole. Cost of sales includes the
corresponding direct production costs and related production overheads of goods sold and services rendered.
Start-up costs between validation and the achievement of normal production capacity are expensed as incurred.
Finance Report 2006 29Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Royalty income and expenses
Royalty income and expenses are recognised on an accrual basis. Royalty expenses directly linked to goods sold
are included in ‘Cost of sales’. Other royalty expenses are included in ‘General and administration’.
Research and development
In addition to its internal research and development activities, the Group is also party to in-licensing and
similar arrangements with its alliance partners. Furthermore the Group may acquire in-process research and
development assets, either through business combinations or through purchases of specific assets.
Internal research costs are charged against income as incurred. Internal development costs are capitalised as
intangible assets only when there is an identifiable asset that can be completed and that will generate probable
future economic benefits and when the cost of such an asset can be measured reliably. The Group does not
currently have any such internal development costs that qualify for capitalisation as intangible assets. Other
internal development costs are charged against income as incurred since the criteria for their recognition as an
asset are not met.
In-process research and development assets acquired either through in-licensing arrangements, business
combinations or separate purchases are capitalised as intangible assets as described below. Once available for
use, such intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the expected benefit and are
reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Licensing, milestone and other upfront receipts and payments
Certain Group companies receive from third parties upfront, milestone and other similar payments relating to the
sale or licensing of products or technology. Revenue associated with performance milestones is recognised based
on achievement of the deliverables as defined in the respective agreements. Upfront payments and licence
feesfor which there are subsequent deliverables are initially reported as deferred income and are recognised as
revenue in income as earned over the period of the development collaboration or the manufacturing obligation.
Payments made by Group companies to third parties and associated companies for such items are capitalised as
intangible assets.
Receipts and payments between consolidated subsidiaries, such as between Genentech, Chugai and other Roche
Group subsidiaries, are eliminated on consolidation.
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding taxes payable
on the distribution of retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based on income, such as property and
capital taxes, are included within general and administration expenses.
Liabilities for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings,
principally relating to subsidiaries, are only recognised where it is probable that such earnings will be remitted in
the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred income tax assets relating
to the carry-forward of unused tax losses are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit
will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
Current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the
sametaxation authority and when there is a legally enforceable right to offset them. Deferred income taxes are
determined based on the currently enacted tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction where the Group operates.
30 Finance Report 2006Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Discontinued businesses and non-current assets held for sale
A discontinued business is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business
or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Reclassification
as a discontinued business occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held
for sale, if earlier.
A disposal group is a group of assets that are to be disposed of as a group in a single transaction, together
withthe liabilities directly associated with those assets that will be transferred in the transaction. The assets and
liabilities in a disposal group are reclassified as held for sale if their value will be recovered principally through a
sale rather than through continuing use. The disposal group must be available for sale in its current condition and
the sale must be highly probable.
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the measurement of all assets and liabilities in a disposal group
is updated in accordance with applicable accounting policies. Then, on initial reclassification as held for sale,
disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses
on initial classification as held for sale are included in the income statement.
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary
benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group. Where
the Group provides long-term employee benefits, the cost is accrued to match the rendering of the services by
the employees concerned. Liabilities for long-term employee benefits are discounted to take into account the time
value of money, where material.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Most employees are covered by defined benefit and defined contribution post-employment plans sponsored by
Group companies. The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the appropriate income
statement heading within the operating results in the year to which they relate. The accounting and reporting of
defined benefit plans are based on recent actuarial valuations. The defined benefit obligations and service costs
are calculated using the projected unit credit method. This reflects service rendered by employees to the dates of
valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the
present value of benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth and long-term expected rates of return for plan
assets. Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds in the country concerned.
Past service costs are allocated over the average period until the benefits become vested. Current and past
service costs are charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results. Pension plan
administration and funding is overseen at a corporate level and any settlement gains and losses resulting from
changes in funding arrangements are reported as general and administration expenses within the Corporate
business segment. The expected returns on plan assets and interest costs are charged to financial income and
financing costs, respectively. Actuarial gains and losses, which consist of differences between assumptions and
actual experiences and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recorded directly in equity. Pension
assets and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable
right to use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan. The recognition of pension assets is
limited to the total of the present value of any future refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions
to the plans and any cumulative unrecognised past service costs. Adjustments arising from the limit on the
recognition of assets for defined benefit plans are recorded directly in equity.
Equity compensation plans
Certain employees of the Group participate in equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Genentech
and Chugai. The fair value of all equity compensation awards granted to employees is estimated at the grant date
and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. The expense is charged to the appropriate income statement
heading within the operating results. For equity-settled plans, an increase in equity is recorded and any
subsequent cash flows from exercises of vested awards are recorded as an increase in equity. For cash-settled
plans, a liability is recorded, which is measured at fair value at each balance sheet date with any movements
in fair value being recorded to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results. Any
subsequent cash flows from exercises of vested awards are recorded as a reduction of the liability.
Finance Report 2006 31Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction, and include all costs
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating
in the manner intended by management. These include items such as costs of site preparation, installation and
assembly costs and professional fees. The net costs of testing whether the asset is functioning properly, including
validation costs, are also included in the initially recorded cost of construction.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis, except for land, which is not depreciated.
Estimated useful lives of major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
Land improvements 40 years
Buildings 10–50 years
Machinery and equipment 5–15 years
Diagnostic instruments 3–5 years
Office equipment 3 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for
as separate items. The estimated useful life of the assets is regularly reviewed and, if necessary, the future
depreciation charge is accelerated. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Borrowing costs
are not capitalised.
Leases
Where the Group is the lessee, leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all of
the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the start of
the lease at fair value, or the present value of the minimum lease payments, if lower. The rental obligation, net of
finance charges, is reported within debt. Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated in accordance
with the Group’s policy on property, plant and equipment. If there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will
obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its
useful life. The interest element of the lease payment is charged against income over the lease term based on
the effective interest rate method. Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not
transferred to the Group are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged
against income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where the Group is the lessor, assets subject to finance leases are reported as receivables at an amount equal
to the net investment in the lease. Assets subject to operating leases are reported within property, plant and
equipment. Lease income from finance leases is recognised over the term of the lease based on the effective
interest rate method. Lease income from operating leases is recognised over the lease term on a straight-line
basis.
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The cost of acquisition is the
consideration given in exchange for control over the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the
acquired company. This consideration includes the cash paid plus the fair value at the date of exchange of assets
given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group. The cost of acquisition also
includes directly attributable costs. The acquired net assets, being the identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities, are initially recognised at fair value. Where the Group does not acquire 100% ownership of
the acquired company, minority interest is recorded as the minority’s proportion of the fair value of the acquired
net assets. Goodwill is recorded as the surplus of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value
of the acquired net assets. Any goodwill and fair value adjustments are recorded as assets and liabilities of the
acquired company and are recorded in the functional currency of that company. Goodwill is not amortised, but is
assessed for possible impairment at each balance sheet date and is additionally tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill may also arise upon investments in associated companies, being the surplus of the cost of investment
over the Group’s share of the fair value of the net identifiable assets. Such goodwill is recorded within investments
in associated companies.
32 Finance Report 2006Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Intangible assets
Purchased patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Where these
assets have been acquired through a business combination, this will be the fair value allocated in the acquisition
accounting. Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis beginning from the
point when they are available for use. Estimated useful life is the lower of the legal duration and the economic
useful life. The estimated useful life of intangible assets is regularly reviewed. Amortisation and impairment of
intangible assets is presented separately in the income statement due to the materiality of the amounts and in
order to fairly present the Group’s results.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
When there is evidence that an asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is calculated and an
impairment assessment is carried out. In addition intangible assets that are not yet available for use are tested
for impairment annually. When the recoverable amount of an asset, being the higher of its fair value less costs to
sell and its value in use, is less than its carrying amount, then the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable
amount. This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. Value in use is calculated using
estimated cash flows, generally over a five-year period, with extrapolating projections for subsequent years. These
are discounted using an appropriate long-term pre-tax interest rate. When an impairment loss arises, the useful
life of the asset in question is reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation/amortisation charge is
accelerated. The impairment of financial assets is discussed below in the ‘financial assets’ policy.
Impairment of goodwill
An impairment assessment of goodwill is carried out annually. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units as
described in Note 16. When the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, being the higher of its fair value
less costs to sell or its value in use, is less than its carrying amount, then an impairment in the carrying amount
is recorded. The methodology used in the impairment testing is further described in Note 16.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods and work in process
includes raw materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs and overheads based upon the normal
capacity of production facilities. Borrowing costs are not included. Cost is determined using the weighted average
method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to completion and selling expenses.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts,
trade discounts, cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances. An allowance for doubtful accounts is
recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount where there is objective
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. Trade discounts, cash discounts, volume
rebates and similar allowances are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of the related
sales, using estimates based on existing contractual obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience.
Long-term accounts receivable are discounted to take into account the time value of money, where material.
Provisions for sales returns and sales charge-backs are reported as provisions and accrued liabilities,
respectively.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and time, call and current balances with banks and similar
institutions. Such balances are only reported as cash if they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash,
are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value, and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of
acquisition. This definition is also used for the cash flow statement.
Finance Report 2006 33Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Provisions
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to
an outflow of resources that can be reasonably estimated. In particular, restructuring provisions are recognised
when the Group has a detailed formal plan that has either commenced implementation or been announced.
Provisions are recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise, taking into account foreign
currency effects arising from their translation from their functional currency into Swiss francs and the time value
of money, where material. A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be
confirmed by future events, or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.
Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Fair values
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between
knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by reference to quoted market
prices or by the use of established estimation techniques such as option pricing models and estimated
discounted values of cash flows. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are
approximately in line with their reported carrying values unless specifically mentioned in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Financial assets
Financial assets, principally investments, including marketable securities, are classified as either ‘Fair-value-
through-profit-or-loss’, ‘Available-for-sale’, ‘Held-to-maturity’ or ‘Loans and receivables’. Fair-value-through-
profit-or-loss financial assets are either classified as held-for-trading, or designated upon initial recognition.
Held-for-trading financial assets are acquired principally to generate profit from short-term fluctuations in price.
Financial assets are designated as fair-value-through-profit-or-loss if doing so results in more relevant
information by eliminating a measurement or recognition inconsistency. Held-to-maturity financial assets are
securities with a fixed maturity that the Group has the intent and ability to hold until maturity. Loans and
receivables are loans and other long-term financial assets created by the Group or acquired from the issuer in a
primary market. They are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted
in an active market. All other financial assets are considered to be available-for-sale.
All financial assets are initially recorded at fair value, including transaction costs, except for assets designated as
fair-value-through-profit-or-loss, which exclude transaction costs. All purchases and sales are recognised on the
settlement date. Fair-value-through-profit-or-loss financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value, with all
changes in fair value recorded as financial income in the period in which they arise. Held-to-maturity financial
assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Available-for-sale
financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value, with all unrealised changes in fair value recorded in equity
except for interest calculated using the effective interest rate method and foreign exchange components. When
the available-for-sale financial assets are sold, impaired or otherwise disposed of, the cumulative gains and losses
previously recognised in equity are included in financial income for the current period. Loans and receivables are
subsequently carried at amortised cost.
Financial assets are assessed for possible impairment at each balance sheet date. An impairment charge is
recorded where there is objective evidence of impairment, such as where the issuer is in bankruptcy, default or
other significant financial difficulty. Any available-for-sale financial assets that have a market value of more than
25% below their original cost, net of any previous impairment, will be considered as impaired. Any available-
for-sale financial assets that have a market value below their original cost, net of any previous impairment, for a
sustained six-month period will be considered as impaired. Any decreases in the market price of less than 25%
of original cost, net of any previous impairment, which are also for less than a sustained six-month period are not
by themselves considered as objective evidence of impairment. Such movements in fair value are recorded in
equity until there is objective evidence of impairment or until the asset is sold or otherwise disposed of. For
financial assets carried at amortised cost, any impairment charge is the difference between the carrying value
and the recoverable amount, calculated using estimated future cash flows discounted using the original effective
interest rate. For available-for-sale financial assets, any impairment charge is the amount currently carried in
equity for the difference between the original cost, net of any previous impairment, and the fair value.
34 Finance Report 2006Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows of the assets expire or when the
Group sells or otherwise disposes of the contractual rights to the cash flows, including situations where the Group
retains the contractual rights but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to a third party.
Derivatives
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Apart from those
derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments (see below), all changes in fair value are
recorded as financial income in the period in which they arise. Embedded derivatives are recognised separately
if not closely related to the host contract and where the host contract is carried at amortised cost.
Hedging
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types. Fair value hedges are hedges
of particular risks that may change the fair value of a recognised asset or liability. Cash flow hedges are hedges
of particular risks that may change the amount or timing of future cash flows. Hedges of net investment in a
foreign entity are hedges of particular risks that may change the carrying value of the net assets of a foreign entity.
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation,
probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. If these conditions are not met,
then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged
item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship. In particular any derivatives are
reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial income.
For qualifying fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item is recorded
at its previous carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair value that are attributable to the hedged risk.
Anychanges in the fair values are reported in financial income.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of any change
infairvalue that is an effective hedge is included in equity, and any remaining ineffective portion is reported in
financial income. If the hedging relationship is the hedge of a firm commitment or highly probable forecasted
transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the cumulative changes of fair value
of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in the initial carrying value of the asset
or liability at the date of recognition. For all other qualifying cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes of fair
value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in financial income when the
forecasted transaction affects net income.
For qualifying hedges of net investment in a foreign entity, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The
portion of any change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity. Any remaining ineffective
portion is recorded in financial income where the hedging instrument is a derivative and in equity in other cases.
If the entity is disposed of, then the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been
recorded in equity are reclassified to income.
Debt instruments
Debt instruments are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Subsequently they are reported at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Any discount between the
net proceeds received and the principal value due on redemption is amortised over the duration of the debt
instrument and is recognised as part of financing costs using the effective interest rate method. Certain debt
instruments may be designated as ‘fair-value-through-profit-or-loss’ where doing so results in more relevant
information as it eliminates or significantly reduces measurement or recognition inconsistencies. Such debt
instruments are reported at fair value, based on quoted prices in an active market, with movements in fair value
reported within financial income. Those debt instruments that are designated as fair-value-through-profit-or-loss
are disclosed in Note 30.
Finance Report 2006 35Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
A bifurcation is carried out upon the issue of convertible debt instruments. The initial carrying value of the liability
element is calculated using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible instrument. The remainder
of the net proceeds is allocated to the equity conversion option, which is reported in equity, and to deferred
income tax liabilities. The liability element is subsequently reported at amortised cost, or fair-value-through-
profit-and-loss if so designated.
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The original purchase
cost, consideration received for subsequent resale of these equity instruments and other movements are reported
as changes in equity. These instruments have been acquired primarily to meet the obligations that may arise in
respect of certain of the Group’s debt instruments.
Management judgements made in applying accounting policies
The application of the Group’s accounting policies may require management to make judgements, apart from
those involving estimates, that can have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated
financial statements. Management judgement is particularly required when assessing the substance of
transactions that have a complicated structure or legal form. These include, but are not limited to, the following
areas:
Revenue recognition: The nature of the Group’s business is such that many sales transactions do not have a
simple structure. Sales agreements may consist of multiple components occurring at different times. The Group
is also party to various out-licensing agreements, which can involve upfront and milestone payments that
may occur over several years. These agreements may also involve certain future obligations. Revenue is only
recognised when, in management’s judgement, the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been
transferred and when the Group does not retain continuing managerial involvement or effective control over the
goods sold or when the obligation has been fulfilled. For some transactions this can result in cash receipts being
initially recognised as deferred income and then released to income over subsequent periods on the basis of the
performance of the conditions specified in the agreement.
Leases: The Group is party to leasing arrangements, both as a lessee and as a lessor. The treatment of leasing
transactions in the financial statements is mainly determined by whether the lease is considered to be an
operating lease or a finance lease. In making this assessment, management looks at the substance of the lease,
as well as the legal form, and makes a judgement about whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of
ownership are transferred.
Key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
income, expenses and related disclosures. The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical
experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in accounting estimates
may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based, or as a result of
new information or more experience. Such changes are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.
The key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next twelve months are
described below.
36 Finance Report 2006Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Sales allowances: The Group has accruals and provisions for expected sales returns, charge-backs and other
rebates, including Medicaid in the United States and similar rebates in other countries, which at 31 December
2006 total 762 million Swiss francs. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual or legislatively-
mandated obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience. Management believes that the total accruals
and provisions for these items are adequate, based upon currently available information. As these deductions are
based on management estimates, they may be subject to change as better information becomes available. Such
changes that arise could impact the accruals and provisions recognised in the balance sheet in future periods
and consequently the level of sales recognised in the income statement in future periods.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill: The Group has property, plant and
equipment with a carrying value of 16,417 million Swiss francs as disclosed in Note 15. Goodwill has a carrying
value of 5,914 million Swiss francs (see Note 16) and intangible assets have a carrying value of 5,469 million Swiss
francs (see Note 17). All of these assets are reviewed annually for impairment as described above. To assess
whether any impairment exists, estimates are made of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of
the asset and its eventual disposal. Actual outcomes could vary significantly from such estimates of discounted
future cash flows. Factors such as changes in the planned use of buildings, machinery or equipment, or closure
of facilities, the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence or lower than anticipated sales for
products with capitalised rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits: Many of the Group’s employees participate in post-
employment defined benefit plans. The calculations of the recognised assets and liabilities from such plans are
based upon statistical and actuarial calculations. In particular the present value of the defined benefit obligation
is impacted by assumptions on discount rates used to arrive at the present value of future pension liabilities, and
assumptions on future increases in salaries and benefits. Furthermore, the Group’s independent actuaries use
statistically based assumptions covering areas such as future withdrawals of participants from the plan and
estimates on life expectancy. At 31 December 2006 the present value of the Group’s defined benefit obligation is
11,002 million Swiss francs for funded plans and 3,596 million Swiss francs for unfunded plans (see Note 13). The
actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changes in market and economic
conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, longer or shorter life spans of participants, and other changes in the
factors being assessed. These differences could impact the assets or liabilities recognised in the balance sheet
in future periods.
Legal provisions: Group companies are party to various legal proceedings and the most significant matters are
described in Notes 7 and 28. Legal provisions at 31 December 2006 total 1,320 million Swiss francs, as disclosed
in Note 28. Additional claims could be made which might not be covered by existing provisions or by insurance.
There can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in the scope of these matters or that any future
lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations will not be material. Such changes that arise could impact the
provisions recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Environmental provisions: The Group has provisions for environmental remediation costs, which at
31 December 2006 total 186 million Swiss francs, as disclosed in Note 28. The material components of the
environmental provisions consist of costs to fully clean and refurbish contaminated sites and to treat and contain
contamination at certain other sites. Future remediation expenses are affected by a number of uncertainties that
include, but are not limited to, the detection of previously unknown contaminated sites, the method and extent
of remediation, the percentage of waste material attributable to the Group at the remediation sites relative to
that attributable to other parties, and the financial capabilities of the other potentially responsible parties.
Management believes that the total provisions for environmental matters are adequate based upon currently
available information. However, given the inherent difficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, it cannot be
guaranteed that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued. The effect of the resolution of
environmental matters on the results of operations cannot be predicted due to uncertainty concerning both the
amount and the timing of future expenditures. Such changes that arise could impact the provisions recognised
inthe balance sheet in future periods.
Finance Report 2006 37Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Income taxes: At 31 December 2006, the net liability for current income taxes is 1,776 million Swiss francs and
the net liability for deferred income taxes is 375 million Swiss francs, as disclosed in Note 9. Significant estimates
are required to determine the current and deferred assets and liabilities for income taxes. Some of these
estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Management believes that the
estimates are reasonable and that the recognised liabilities for income tax-related uncertainties are adequate.
Various internal and external factors may have favourable or unfavourable effects on the income tax assets and
liabilities. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing
interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, future levels of research and development spending, and
changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. Such changes that arise could impact the assets and liabilities
recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Changes in accounting policies
The Group adopted certain new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards and interpretations
effective 1 January 2006. A description of those changes that are material to the Group and their effect on the
consolidated financial statements is given below.
IAS 19 (revised): ‘Employee Benefits’. Amongst other matters, the revised standard allows actuarial gains and
losses from defined benefit plans to be recorded directly to equity. In this case adjustments arising from the limits
on the recognition of assets for defined benefit plans are also to be recorded directly to equity. The revised
standard requires retrospective application. In addition the Group now reports the expected return on plan
assetsand interest costs from defined benefit plans as part of financial income and financing costs, respectively,
and the corresponding post-employment benefit assets and liabilities are included in non-segment assets and
liabilities in the segment reporting. This change in presentation aligns the reporting of the Group’s results more
closely with its internal management and organisation structure.
Further information on the Group’s pension and other post-employment benefits is given in Note 13.
Presentation of income statement: The income statement for the year ended 31 December 2005 has been
restated following the changes in IFRS that were adopted effective 1 January 2006. In addition the Group has
made certain presentational changes to further improve comparability of its results to those of other healthcare
companies and to allow readers to make a more accurate assessment of the sustainable earnings capacity of the
Group. These changes, which have been applied retrospectively, are listed below.
• Support costs for leased diagnostics instruments are now reported as part of ‘Cost of sales’ instead of
‘Marketing and distribution’. In 2006 these were 114 million Swiss francs (2005: 76 million Swiss francs).

Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Future changes in IFRS: The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of the new and revised
standards that will be effective from 1 January 2007. The Group does not expect that the new and revised
standards and interpretations will have a significant effect on the Group’s results and financial position, although
they will expand financial statement disclosure in certain areas, notably IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’
which the Group will implement in 2007. The Group is also in the process of evaluating IFRS 8 ‘Operating
Segments’ which will be effective from 1 January 2009.
2. Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising from its underlying operations and corporate finance
activities. The Group’s financial risk exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange rates,
interest rates and equity prices as well as the creditworthiness and solvency of the Group’s counterparties.
The Group’s subsidiaries Genentech and Chugai have their own treasury operations. These have operational
independence, whilst working within a financial risk management framework that is consistent with the rest of
the Group. More information on their financial risks is available in the annual reports of Genentech and Chugai.
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies and guidelines approved by senior
management. These policies and guidelines cover foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk
and liquidity risk. Group policies and guidelines also cover areas such as cash management, investment of excess
funds and the raising of short- and long-term debt. Compliance with the policies and guidelines is managed by
segregated functions within the Group.
The objective of financial risk management is to contain, where deemed appropriate, exposures in the various
types of financial risks mentioned above in order to limit any negative impact on the Group’s results and financial
position.
The Group actively measures, monitors and manages its financial risk exposures by various functions pursuant to
segregation-of-duties principles.
In accordance with its financial risk policies, the Group manages its market risk exposures through the use of
financial instruments such as derivatives, when deemed appropriate. It is the Group’s policy and practice not
to enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes, nor for purposes unrelated to the
underlying business.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates across the world and is exposed to movements in foreign currencies affecting its net income
and financial position, as expressed in Swiss francs. The Group actively monitors its currency exposures and,
when appropriate, enters into transactions with the aim of preserving the value of assets, commitments and
anticipated transactions. The Group uses forward contracts, foreign exchange options and cross-currency swaps
to hedge certain committed and anticipated foreign exchange flows and financing transactions.
Transaction exposure arises because the amount of local currency paid or received for transactions
denominated in foreign currencies may vary due to changes in exchange rates. Similarly, transaction exposure
arises on net balances of monetary assets held in foreign currencies. For many Group companies revenues and
operating expenses are primarily in the local currency. At local level, the Group companies manage this exposure,
if necessary, by means of financial instruments such as options and forward contracts. In addition, Group Treasury
monitors total worldwide exposure on a monthly basis.
Translation exposure arises from the consolidation of the foreign currency denominated financial statements of
the Group’s foreign subsidiaries. The effect on the Group’s consolidated equity is shown as a currency translation
movement. The Group partially hedges net investments in foreign currencies by taking out foreign currency loans
or issuing foreign currency denominated debt instruments. Major translation exposures are monitored regularly.
40 Finance Report 2006Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
A significant part of the Group’s cash outflows for research, development, production and administration is
denominated in Swiss francs, while a much smaller proportion of the Group’s cash inflows are Swiss franc
denominated. As a result, an increase in the value of the Swiss franc relative to other currencies has an adverse
impact on consolidated net income. Similarly, a relative decrease in the value of the Swiss franc has a favourable
effect on results when reported in Swiss francs.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could have effects on the Group’s net income or
financial position. Changes in interest rates may cause variations in interest income and expenses resulting from
interest-bearing assets and liabilities. In addition, they can affect the market value of certain financial assets,
liabilities and instruments as described in the following section on market risk of financial assets. The interest
rates on the Group’s major debt instruments are fixed, as described in Note 30. The Group uses interest rate
derivatives to manage its interest rate risk.
Market risk of financial assets
Changes in the market value of certain financial assets and derivative instruments can affect the net income
or financial position of the Group. Financial long-term assets are held for strategic purposes and marketable
securities are held for fund management purposes. The risk of loss in value is managed by reviews prior to
investing and continuous monitoring of the performance of investments and changes in their risk profile.
Investments in equities, bonds, debentures and other fixed income instruments are entered into on the basis of
guidelines with regard to liquidity and credit rating.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counterparty to a transaction may be unable or unwilling to meet
their obligations causing a financial loss to the Group. Trade receivables are subject to a policy of active risk
management which focuses on the assessment of country risk, credit availability, ongoing credit evaluation and
account monitoring procedures. Except as noted below, there are no significant concentrations within trade
receivables of counterparty credit risk due to the Group’s large number of customers and their wide geographical
spread. For some credit exposures in critical countries, the Group has obtained credit insurance. Country risk
exposures are continuously monitored. The exposure of other financial assets to credit risk is controlled by
settinga policy for limiting credit exposure to high-quality counterparties, regular reviews of credit ratings, and
setting defined limits for each counterparty. Where appropriate to reduce exposure, netting agreements under
an ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) master agreement are signed with the respective
counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering
netting agreements, is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets plus the positive fair value of derivative
instruments. The credit exposure is diversified amongst different counterparties.
At 31 December 2006 the Group’s combined trade accounts receivable balance with three US national
wholesale distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corp., Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corp., was equivalent to
1.5 billion Swiss francs representing 17% of the Group’s consolidated trade accounts receivable (2005: 1.1 billion
Swiss francs representing 14%).
Liquidity risk
Group companies require sufficient availability of cash to meet their obligations. Individual companies are
generally responsible for their own cash management, including the short-term investment of cash surpluses and
the raising of loans to cover cash deficits, subject to guidance by the Group and, in certain cases, to approval at
Group level. The Group maintains sufficient reserves of cash and readily realisable marketable securities to meet
its liquidity requirements at all times. In addition, the strong international creditworthiness of the Group provides
the ability to efficiently use international capital markets for financing purposes. The Group has unused
committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling 4.3 billion Swiss francs. This includes a
syndicated credit facility of 2.5 billion euros and bank commitment lines of 30 billion Japanese yen at Chugai.

4. Genentech
Effective 7 September 1990 the Group acquired a majority interest of approximately 60% of Genentech, Inc.,
a biotechnology company in the United States. On 13 June 1999 the Group exercised its option to acquire the
remaining shares of Genentech on 30 June 1999, at which point Genentech became a 100% owned subsidiary
of the Group. On 23 July 1999, 26 October 1999 and 29 March 2000 the Group completed public offerings
of Genentech’s common stock, which reduced the Group’s majority interest to 60%. During 2004 the
Group’s ownership of Genentech decreased by 2.45% due to the conversion and redemption of the ‘LYONs IV’
US dollar exchangeable notes. Genentech issues additional shares of common stock in connection with its
equity compensation plans and also may issue additional shares for other purposes, which affects the
Group’s percentage ownership interest. The affiliation agreement between the Group and Genentech provides,
amongst other things, that Genentech establish a stock repurchase programme to maintain the Group’s
percentage ownership interest in Genentech. At 31 December 2006 the Group’s interest in Genentech was
55.8%(2005: 55.7%).
44 Finance Report 2006Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The common stock of Genentech is publicly traded and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the
symbol ‘DNA’. Genentech prepares financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (US GAAP). These are filed on a quarterly basis with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC).
Differences between IFRS and US GAAP
Due to certain consolidation entries and differences in the requirements of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and US GAAP, there are differences between Genentech’s stand-alone financial results on a US
GAAP basis and the financial results of Genentech as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS.

Translated at 1 USD = 1.25 CHF (2005: 1 USD = 1.25 CHF).
Effective 1 January 2005 the Group implemented IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ in its IFRS financial statements.
Amongst other matters, the standard requires that the fair value of all equity compensation plans awarded to
employees be estimated at grant date and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. The expense is charged
against the appropriate income statement heading. The standard also requires retrospective application, within
certain transitional requirements. In 2006 a pre-tax expense of 407 million US dollars or 510 million Swiss francs
relating to plans at Genentech has been recorded (2005: 235 million US dollars or 293 million Swiss francs). Due to
the impact of the transitional requirements these amounts are not indicative of the future expenses for such plans.
Effective 1 January 2006 Genentech implemented US Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R –
‘Share-Based Payment’ (FAS 123R) in its US GAAP financial statements. Amongst other matters, this requires that
companies reporting under US GAAP recognise compensation expenses for such plans. Due to the different
dates of first application, measurement requirements and transitional arrangements of FAS 123R and IFRS 2, the
expenses recorded by Genentech in its US GAAP financial statements for equity compensation plans are not the
same as the expenses recorded in the Roche Group IFRS financial statements for these same plans.
Finance Report 2006 45Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
In 2005 the Group implemented IAS 38 (revised) ‘Intangible Assets’ in its IFRS financial statements. Amongst
other matters, the revised standard typically results in more intangible assets being recognised from in-licensing
arrangements and similar research and development alliances. In Genentech’s US GAAP financial statements
such expenditure would usually be recorded as research and development expenses.
There are other differences between IFRS and US GAAP, but these have a relatively minor impact.
Genentech share repurchases
On 20 April 2006 Genentech’s Board of Directors approved an extension of the existing stock repurchase
programme authorising Genentech to repurchase up to 100 million shares of Genentech’s common stock for a
total of 6 billion US dollars through 30 June 2007. Since the programme’s inception, Genentech has repurchased
approximately 62 million shares for a total of approximately 4.4 billion US dollars. During 2006 Genentech
repurchased common stock worth 996 million US dollars or 1,248 million Swiss francs (2005: 2,016 million US
dollars or 2,511 million Swiss francs).
Manufacturing agreements with Lonza
Effective 8 December 2006 Genentech sold its wholly-owned subsidiary Genentech España, including the
manufacturing facility in Porriño, Spain, to Lonza Group Ltd. (‘Lonza’) for 150 million US dollars. In 2006 11 million
US dollars were received in cash and the remaining balance will be received from Lonza in a series of payments
over the next three years. As part of this agreement Genentech has entered into a short-term supply contract with
Lonza for the production of Avastin using a portion of the production capacity of the Porriño facility.

At the same time Genentech has entered into a supply agreement for the manufacture of certain Genentech
products at Lonza’s facility under construction in Singapore which is currently expected to receive US Food and
Drug Administration (‘FDA’) licensure in 2010. Genentech is committed to fund the pre-commissioning production
qualification costs at this facility and, upon FDA licensure, Genentech is committed to purchase 100% of products
successfully manufactured at the facility for a period of three years after commissioning of the facility. The
estimated total cost of these pre- and post-commissioning commitments is approximately 440 million US dollars.
Genentech has also received an exclusive option to purchase the Lonza Singapore facility during the period from
2007 up to one year after FDA licensure for a purchase price of 290 million US dollars. Regardless of whether the
purchase option is exercised, Genentech will be obliged to make a milestone payment of 70 million US dollars if
certain performance milestones are met at the facility being constructed.
Genentech has also entered into a loan agreement with Lonza to advance up to 299 million US dollars to Lonza
for the construction of the Singapore facility, the majority of which is not expected to be advanced until 2008. The
majority of these funds will not be advanced to Lonza unless and until Lonza’s securitisation obligations for such
are mutually agreed upon by the parties. If Genentech exercises its option to purchase the facility then any
outstanding advances may be offset against the purchase price. If Genentech does not exercise its purchase
option then the advances may be offset against supply purchases.

Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Oceanside biologics manufacturing facility
On 23 June 2005 Genentech completed the purchase of the Oceanside biologics manufacturing facility in San
Diego, California, from Biogen Idec. The purchase cost, including closing costs, was 531 million Swiss francs.
Acquisition of Tanox
On 9 November 2006 Genentech announced plans to acquire a 100% controlling interest in Tanox, Inc. (‘Tanox’),
a publicly owned company listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol ‘TNOX’. Tanox is a biotechnology company
based in Houston, Texas, that specialises in the discovery and development of biotherapeutics based on
monoclonal antibody technology. Genentech and Tanox have been working together in collaboration with
Novartis since 1996 to develop and commercialise Xolair. The expected purchase consideration, excluding
transaction costs, is 919 million US dollars in cash. Funds will be provided from Genentech’s cash on hand at
thetime of closing. On 15 January 2007 the transaction was approved by Tanox’s shareholders. The transaction,
which is subject to regulatory clearance, is expected to be completed in the first half of 2007.
Leasing arrangements
During the third quarter of 2005 Genentech paid 585 million US dollars to buy out the lease obligations in respect
of its manufacturing facility at Vacaville, California and certain buildings on its South San Francisco site.
In December 2004 Genentech entered into a Master Lease Agreement with Slough SSF LLC (‘Slough’) for the
development of property adjacent to Genentech’s South San Francisco site. The development includes a total of
eight buildings, which are subject to separate agreements as contemplated by the Master Lease Agreement.
Slough as the developer will construct the building shell for each building and Genentech will finish the interior
of each building as laboratory or office space, as applicable. The construction of the first buildings was completed
in 2006, at which point the lease term for those buildings was deemed to begin. Construction of the final buildings
is expected to be completed during 2008. The lease term expires twelve years from the occupation of the final
building. Genentech has two five-year renewal options for each building and has an option to purchase the
various buildings at different dates between 2016 and 2020. Genentech also has a right of first refusal with
respect to each building or the entire development should Slough consider selling part or all of the development.
As at 31 December 2006, based on the status of the development to date, the total carrying value of property,
plant and equipment from this agreement, including tenant improvements, was 228 million Swiss francs and the
carrying value of the leasing obligation was 219 million Swiss francs. Estimates of the total future minimum lease
payments anticipated by the entire Master Lease Agreement are shown below.

5. Chugai
Effective 1 October 2002 the Roche Group and Chugai completed an alliance to create a leading research-
driven Japanese pharmaceutical company, which was formed by the merger of Chugai and Roche’s Japanese
pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Nippon Roche. The merged company, known as Chugai, is a fully consolidated
subsidiary of the Group. At 31 December 2006 the Group’s interest in Chugai was 50.6% (2005: 50.6%).
Finance Report 2006 47Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The common stock of Chugai is publicly traded and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the stock code
‘TSE:4519’. Chugai prepares financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
Japan (JGAAP). These are filed on a quarterly basis with the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Differences between IFRS and JGAAP
Due to certain consolidation entries and differences in the requirements of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and JGAAP, there are differences between Chugai’s stand-alone financial results on a JGAAP
basis and the financial results of Chugai as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS.
The acquisition by Roche of a 50.1% interest in Chugai is treated as a business combination for IFRS. For JGAAP
the alliance is treated as a merger between Chugai and Nippon Roche. Therefore the JGAAP results of Chugai do
not include the goodwill and fair value adjustments that are recorded in Roche’s results, and which are quantified
in the table below. Moreover the acquisition accounting only includes Roche’s 50.1% of these fair value
adjustments and therefore the impact of these on net income needs to be added back in the minority interest
calculations in Roche’s IFRS results.
In Roche’s IFRS results, depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line
method. In Chugai’s JGAAP results the reducing balance method is used. Additionally certain income and
expenses, notably some restructuring costs, are required by JGAAP to be reported as extraordinary items. In
Chugai’s JGAAP results extraordinary items are reported below the operating profit line. In Roche’s IFRS results
such items are normally included as part of operating profit and are not treated as extraordinary or exceptional
items. Restructuring costs were 4 million Swiss francs (2005: 56 million Swiss francs). There are other differences
between IFRS and JGAAP, but these have a relatively minor impact.

Dividends
The dividends distributed to third parties holding Chugai shares during 2006, including special dividends, totalled
100 million Swiss francs (2005: 65 million Swiss francs) and have been recorded against minority interests (see
Note 33). Dividends paid by Chugai to Roche are eliminated on consolidation as inter-company items.
Restructuring of production facilities
On 28 February 2005 Chugai announced a restructuring of its production facilities, under which five existing
plants will be integrated into two facilities within the next five to six years. As part of this restructuring the plant
at Kagamiishi was sold during the first half of 2005. Total restructuring costs in 2005, including the loss on
disposal of the Kagamiishi plant, were 56 million Swiss francs. This was shown as an extraordinary loss in
Chugai’sJGAAP financial statements.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
In the second half of 2005 Chugai returned part of its employees’ pension fund to the Japanese government.
As a result of this there was a settlement gain of 127 million Swiss francs. In accordance with the Group’s
management and organisational structure this was reported as general and administration expenses within the
Corporate business segment in the 2005 results. This was shown as an extraordinary gain in Chugai’s JGAAP
financial statements.
Other matters
Details of Chugai’s equity compensation plans are given in Note 14. Details of the ‘Series 6 Chugai
Pharmaceutical Unsecured Convertible Bonds’, including conversions during the year, are given in Note 30.

Income from out-licensing agreements
Certain Group companies receive from third parties upfront, milestone and other similar payments relating to the
sale or licensing of products or technology. Revenue associated with performance milestones is recognised based
on achievement of the milestones, as defined in the respective agreements. Revenue from upfront payments and
licence fees for which there are subsequent deliverables is initially reported as deferred income and is recognised
in income as earned over the period of the development collaboration or the manufacturing obligation.
Gains on disposal of products
As part of the continuous realignment of its product portfolio, the Group periodically disposes of product
lines that are no longer considered as core products or priorities within the product development portfolio.
The proceeds are reinvested in the Group’s in-licensing arrangements and other research and development
alliances and collaborations.

cash outflow from major legal cases during the year was 31 million Swiss francs (2005: 180 million Swiss francs).
Roche Pharmaceuticals legal cases
Roche Diagnostics GmbH (‘RDG’) and SmithKline Beecham (Cork) Ltd (‘SB’) are party to arbitration concerning
RDG’s termination in 1998 of the Carvedilol License Agreement of 1987, as amended in 1995, relating to the
licensing and co-marketing of carvedilol. RDG has submitted two claims for damages to two Arbitration Tribunals
in Zurich and SB has submitted a counterclaim asserting the invalidity of RDG’s termination and claiming
damages. Based on the development of the current arbitration and settlement negotiations, the Group increased
its existing provisions by 210 million Swiss francs in 2005. There have been no developments in 2006 that would
require any further changes to the provisions already recorded by the Group. The total amount of provisions
recorded by RDG is not disclosed as this may seriously prejudice RDG’s position in this matter.
Genentech legal cases
On 10 June 2002 Genentech announced that a Los Angeles County Superior Court jury voted to award City of
Hope Medical Center (‘City of Hope’) approximately 300 million US dollars in compensatory damages based on a
finding of a breach of a 1976 agreement between Genentech and the City of Hope. On 24 June 2002 the jury voted
to award City of Hope 200 million US dollars in punitive damages in the same case. On 13 September 2002
Genentech filed a notice of appeal of the jury verdict and damages awards with the California Court of Appeal.
On 21 October 2004 the Court of Appeal affirmed the verdict and damages awards in all respects. Also, on
21 October 2004 Genentech announced that it would seek review by the California Supreme Court, which has
discretion over which cases it will review. On 24 November 2004 Genentech filed its petition for review by the
California Supreme Court and on 2 February 2005 the California Supreme Court granted this petition. The appeal
to the California Supreme Court has been fully briefed and Genentech is waiting to be assigned an oral argument
date. A full provision, which is classified as long-term, has been recorded for the damages awards. During the
appeals process interest accrues on the total amount of the damages at a simple annual rate of 10%. Following
the judgement, interest of 63 million Swiss francs (2005: 62 million Swiss francs) was recorded as the time cost
of provisions, within financing costs. On 3 October 2002 Genentech entered into an arrangement withthird-party
insurance companies to post a surety bond in connection with this judgement. As part of this arrangement
Genentech had pledged 735 million US dollars in cash and investments to secure this bond as at 31 December
2005. This was increased in 2006 by 53 million US dollars to 788 million US dollars. This amount, which is
equivalent to 963 million Swiss francs at 31 December 2006, is reported as restricted cash within financial long-
term assets (see Note 19).
On 4 October 2004 Genentech received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice, requesting
documents related to the promotion of Rituxan, a prescription product approved for the treatment of relapsed or
refractory, low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Genentech is co-operating
with the associated investigation, which, as Genentech has been advised, is both civil and criminal in nature. The
government has called and is expected to call former and current Genentech employees to appear before the
grand jury in connection with this investigation. No provisions have been recorded in respect of this litigation as
the outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
50 Finance Report 2006Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
On 11 April 2003 MedImmune, Inc. (‘MedImmune’) filed a lawsuit against Genentech, the City of Hope National
Medical Center, and Celltech R&D Ltd., in the US District Court for the Central District of California, Los Angeles.
The lawsuit relates to US Patent No. 6,331,415 (‘the Cabilly patent’) that is co-owned by Genentech and the City
of Hope National Medical Center and under which MedImmune and other companies have been licensed and
are paying royalties. The lawsuit includes claims for violation of antitrust, patent and unfair competition laws.
On 14 January 2004 the US District Court granted summary judgement against all of MedImmune’s antitrust
andunfair competition claims. On 23 April 2004 the District Court granted a motion to dismiss all remaining claims
in this case. On 18 October 2005 the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the judgement of the
District Court in all respects. On 10 November 2005 MedImmune filed a petition with the US Supreme Court
seeking a review of the decision to dismiss certain of its claims. The Supreme Court granted MedImmune’s
petition and the oral argument of this case before the Supreme Court occurred on 4 October 2006. On 9 January
2007 the Supreme Court issued a decision reversing the Federal Circuit’s decision and remanding the case to the
lower courts for further proceedings. The decision addresses the issue of whether MedImmune’s patent and
contract claims can go forward in the Federal Court and expresses no opinion regarding the merits of these
claims. No provisions have been recorded in respect of this litigation as the outcome of this matter cannot be
determined at this time.
On 13 May 2005 a request was filed by a third party for re-examination of the Cabilly patent. On 7 July 2005 the
US Patent and Trademark Office ordered a re-examination of this patent. On 13 September 2005 the Patent Office
issued an initial ‘non-final’ Office action rejecting the claims of the patent. Genentech filed a response on
25November 2005 and the Patent Office has not yet acted on this response. A second re-examination request for
this same patent was filed on 23 December 2005 by another third party and on 23 January 2006 the Patent Office
granted the re-examination request. On 6 June 2006 the two re-examinations were combined by the Patent Office
into a single re-examination. On 16 August 2006 the Patent Office issued a non-final Office action in the merged
proceeding, rejecting the claims of the Cabilly patent based on the issues raised in the two re-examination
requests. Genentech filed its response on 30 October 2006 and the Patent Office has not yet acted on this
response. The Cabilly patent, which expires in 2018, relates to methods used by Genentech and others to make
certain antibodies or antibody fragments, as well as cells and DNA used in these methods. Genentech has
licensed the Cabilly patent to other companies and derives significant royalties from these licences. The claims
of the Cabilly patent remain valid and enforceable throughout the re-examination process. Because the re-
examination process is ongoing, no provisions have been recorded in respect of this litigation as the final outcome
of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
On 29 July 2005 a former Genentech employee, whose employment ended in April 2005, filed a non-public (Qui
Tam) complaint under seal in the United States District Court for the District of Maine against Genentech and
Biogen Idec, alleging violations of the False Claims Act and retaliatory discharge of employment. On 20 December
2005 the United States District Court filed notice of its election to decline intervention in the lawsuit. The
complaint was subsequently unsealed and Genentech was served on 5 January 2006. Genentech filed a motion
to dismiss the complaint and on 14 December 2006 the Magistrate Judge issued a Recommended Decision on
this motion. The Magistrate Judge recommended granting Genentech’s motion to dismiss all of the former
employee’s Qui Tam claims and recommended denying Genentech’s motion solely as to the former employee’s
claim for retaliatory discharge of employment. The parties have filed objections with the District Court Judge
concerning those portions of the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision for which review by the District
Court Judge is sought. No provisions have been recorded in respect of this litigation as the potential outcome
cannot be determined at this time.
On 24 March 2004 Mr Kourosh Dastghieb filed a lawsuit against Genentech in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania. The lawsuit relates to Dastghieb’s claim that, based on a relationship with Genentech in the
mid-1990s, he is entitled to profits or proceeds from Genentech’s Lucentis product. Dastghieb has asserted multiple
claims for monetary damages, including a claim under an unjust enrichment theory that he is entitled to the entire
net present value of Lucentis, which he claims is between approximately 1.4 billion US dollars and 4.1 billion US
dollars. On 8 November 2006 a unanimous jury ruled against Dastghieb and in favour of Genentech on all claims
and final judgement was entered in Genentech’s favour. The plaintiff has filed a motion to challenge this judgement
which is set for hearing in early 2007. No provisions have been recorded in respect of this litigation as the potential
outcome cannot be determined at this time.
Finance Report 2006 51Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Genentech’s annual report and quarterly SEC filings contain the detailed disclosures of litigation matters that are
required by US GAAP. These include further details on the above matters as well as including information on other
litigation that is not currently as significant as the matters referred to above.
Diagnostics legal cases
During 2005 provisions for certain litigation and arbitration matters in the Diagnostics Division were increased
by 146 million Swiss francs. There have been no developments in 2006 that would require any further changes
tothe provisions already recorded by the Group.
On 9 October 2003 Applera Corporation (‘Applera’) filed suit against the Group in the Superior Court of California
and filed a Notice of Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association. Both the Superior Court lawsuit and
the arbitration demand made claims concerning the interpretation and enforcement of contracts between the
Group and Applera for the commercialisation of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. The claims
sought termination of certain contracts, declarations regarding rights and obligations under those contracts, and
monetary damages and other relief in an unspecified amount for alleged breaches of various agreements
between the parties. On 15 December 2003 the Group filed its response in the arbitration proceeding. On the
same day, the Group also responded to Applera’s complaint in the Superior Court proceeding by petitioning the
Court to compel arbitration of the claims alleged by Applera and to stay the lawsuit pending completion of the
arbitration. On 22 October 2004 the Court of Appeal of the State of California ruled that the petition to compel
arbitration should be granted and remanded the case to the Superior Court, with directions to grant the petition.
On 9 May 2005 the Group announced that a settlement agreement had been reached with Applera with regard
to the outstanding litigation and arbitration related to contractual relationships involving rights to and
commercialisation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology.
In 1992 the Group filed a suit against the Promega Corporation (‘Promega’) alleging patent infringement and
breach of a licence agreement relating to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. In May 2004 the US
District Court of the Northern District of California decided that one of the patents concerned was unenforceable
and rejected the breach of licence claim. On 12 November 2003 the Group was notified that Promega had filed a
non-public (Qui Tam) action against the Group with the US District Court of the Eastern District of West Virginia
in March 2000. This complaint, filed under the False Claims Act, alleged that the US Federal Government was
overcharged in its purchase of PCR enzyme products. In July 2003 the US Federal Government notified the
Court of its decision not to intervene in Promega’s complaint and on 12 November 2003 the Court ordered the
complaint of 2000 to be unsealed. The Group filed a motion to dismiss this complaint and on 20 August 2004
theCourt dismissed the complaint with prejudice. On 12 September 2005 the Group announced that a settlement
agreement had been reached with Promega with regard to all outstanding litigation related to polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) technology.
Vitamin case
Following the settlement agreement with the US Department of Justice on 20 May 1999 regarding pricing
practices in the vitamin market and the overall settlement agreement to a class action suit brought by the US
buyers of bulk vitamins, the Group recorded provisions in respect of the vitamin case in 1999. These provisions
were the Group’s best estimate at that time of the total liability that may arise, taking into account currency
movements and the time value of money. Provisions for legal fees were recorded separately. The Group recorded
additional provisions in 2001 and 2002, based on the development of the litigation and settlement negotiations in
the US, Europe and elsewhere.
On 17 January 2003 the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a class action litigation brought on
behalf of non-US purchasers of bulk vitamins from the Group and other manufacturers that non-US plaintiffs may
bring claims in US courts under US anti-trust laws for alleged damages suffered from transactions outside the
United States. On 14 June 2004 the Supreme Court of the United States nullified the decision of the District of
Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the lower court to review alternative
arguments which might permit such claims to proceed in the United States. On remand, on 28 June 2005 a panel
of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that US courts do not have jurisdiction over
the plaintiffs’ claims and affirmed the initial dismissal of the complaint. On 26 October 2005 the plaintiffs
petitioned the US Supreme Court for further discretionary review. On 9 January 2006 the US Supreme Court
52 Finance Report 2006Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
issued an order denying the plaintiffs’ petition. On 1 March 2006 the plaintiffs filed a motion in the trial court
seeking relief from the final judgement so that plaintiffs could advance European Union law claims in the trial
court. The trial court has denied that motion, and the plaintiffs’ time to appeal the trial court’s ruling has expired.
The Group considers this matter closed.
The Group is seeking to resolve the remaining outstanding issues; however the timing and the final amounts
involved are uncertain. The remaining provisions are all considered as short-term as cash outflows are expected
to arise during 2007. They are not discounted as the time value of money is not considered material in this case.
As the litigation and negotiations progress, it is possible that the ultimate liability may be different from the
amount of provisions currently recorded.

Net gains (losses) on financial liabilities at fair-value-through-profit-or-loss includes the change in the fair value
that is attributable to changes in the liabilities’ credit risk component. This is calculated by comparing the
difference between the present value of the future cash flows on the bonds, discounted by using a swap (LIBOR)
yield curve, and the market prices of the bonds. Due to there being no major credit spread movement relative to
the swap yield curve during 2006, the change in fair value that is attributable to changes in the liabilities’ credit
risk component was zero (2005: loss of 10 million Swiss francs). The cumulative change in fair value that is
attributable to the change in credit risk since the issuance of the instruments was a gain of 17 million Swiss francs
(2005: gain of 17 million Swiss francs). Interest expense on liabilities at fair-value-through-profit-or-loss was
106million Swiss francs (2005: 105 million Swiss francs).

Acquisitions – 2006
There were no acquisitions in 2006. On 9 November 2006, Genentech announced plans to acquire a 100%
controlling interest in Tanox, Inc., a US biotechnology company. This transaction, which is expected to close in
thefirst half of 2007 subject to regulatory approval, is described in Note 4.
Acquisitions – 2005
GlycArt: Effective 25 July 2005 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in GlycArt Biotechnology Ltd.
(‘GlycArt’), a privately-owned biotechnology research company based in Schlieren, Zurich, in Switzerland. GlycArt
is reported as part of the Roche Pharmaceuticals business segment. The purchase consideration paid was
235million Swiss francs, which has been allocated as follows:
GlycArt acquisition: net assets acquired in millions of CHF
Carrying value Carrying value

Property, plant and equipment 3 3
Deferred income taxes – (42)
Cash 4 4
Other net assets (liabilities) (3) (3)
Total 4 235
Goodwill was recognised resulting from the premium paid for the acquisition. This represents synergies that can
be obtained from the Group’s existing business utilising the acquired core technology. Intangible assets for core
technology are amortised on a straight-line basis over 14 years, beginning 1 August 2005. Intangible assets for
in-process research and development will be amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis beginning
from the point when they are available for use. Subsequent to the acquisition GlycArt contributed a net expense
of 9 million Swiss francs to the Roche Pharmaceuticals business result in 2005. If GlycArt had been acquired on
1 January 2005, the revenues of the Group in 2005 would have been unchanged and the Group’s net income in
2005 would have been lower by a further 7 million Swiss francs compared to the reported results.

Divestment of Consumer Health (OTC) business
On 19 July 2004 the Group announced the sale of Roche Consumer Health, its global OTC (over-the-counter
medicines) business, to the Bayer Group. Under the agreement with Bayer the majority of local businesses were
transferred to Bayer at the end of 2004. The divestment of the remaining 2%, measured in terms of Roche
Consumer Health sales to third parties, was completed in 2005. Under the terms of the agreement the majority of
cash proceeds, totalling 2,886 million Swiss francs, were transferred to the Group on 1 January 2005. In addition
the Group received a further 16 million Swiss francs during the first half of 2005 for the remaining part of the
divestment that was completed in 2005. The calculations of the final amounts arising from the agreed purchase
price adjustment mechanisms have been completed and as a result 5 million Swiss francs were transferred to
Bayer in 2006. There was no effect on net income from this transfer as the amounts concerned were covered by
accruals made in the initial calculation of the gain on disposal. The profit from disposal for 2006 consists of a
release of 19 million Swiss francs in respect of certain accruals andprovisions that are no longer required. The
business results for 2005 include the remaining part of Roche Consumer Health that was transferred to Bayer in
2005. There were no significant cash flows other than the receipt of the divestment proceeds received from Bayer
that are described above.
Divestment of Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business
Effective 30 September 2003 the Group completed the sale of its global Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business
(‘the VFC business’) to the Dutch company DSM. Following the sale of the VFC business, certain assets and
liabilities of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division, mainly associated with the vitamin case, remain with the
Group. The Group and DSM have signed an Indemnity and Co-operation Agreement under which the Group may
provide DSM with certain indemnities and guarantees in connection with the vitamin case. In addition the Group
has given DSM certain indemnities in respect of anyremedial actions at the sites of the VFC business that may
be required by environmental laws. Further arrangements were put in place regarding the utilisation of certain
assets and certain purchasing contracts, as well as adopting DSM as a preferred supplier for pharmaceutical
ingredients. Under one of these arrangements, the Group has guaranteed to purchase for a period of four years
beginning 1 January 2004 products with a sales value totalling 100 million euros. The Group will reimburse DSM
for 75% of any unutilised amounts. The other arrangements consist of certain residual obligations, which have
been fully accrued for. The profit from disposal for 2006 consists of a release of 5 million Swiss francs in respect
of certain accruals and provisions that are no longer required. The business results for 2006 include costs of
4 million Swiss francs (2005: 9 million Swiss francs), due mostly to the after-tax amortisation of discounted
liabilities.

Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Other employee benefits consist mainly of life insurance schemes and certain other insurance schemes providing
medical coverage and other long-term and short-term disability benefits. The charges for employee benefits in
the operating results are included in the relevant expenditure line by function. The expected return on plan assets
and interest costs from defined benefit plans are included as part of financial income and financing costs,
respectively (see Note 8).
13. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group’s objective is to provide attractive and competitive post-employment benefits to employees, while
atthe same time ensuring that the various plans are appropriately financed and managing any potential impacts
on the Group’s long-term financial position. Most employees are covered by pension plans sponsored by Group
companies. The nature of such plans varies according to legal regulations, fiscal requirements and economic
conditions of the countries in which the employees are employed. Other post-employment benefits consist mostly
of post-retirement healthcare and life insurance schemes, principally in the United States. Post-employment
benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions into a
separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation to
pay further contributions. All other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’, even if the Group’s potential
obligation is relatively minor or has a relatively remote possibility of arising. Consequently most of the Group’s
post-employment benefit plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’ for the purpose of these financial
statements.
Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans typically consist of payments by employees and by the Group to funds administered
by third parties. Payments by the Group were 214 million Swiss francs (2005: 174 million Swiss francs). No assets
or liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet in respect of such plans, apart from regular prepayments
and accruals of the contributions withheld from employees’ wages and salaries and of the Group’s contributions.
Defined benefit plans
The Group’s major defined benefit plans are located in Switzerland, the United States, Germany, the United
Kingdom and Japan. Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by
payments from the Group and by employees. In some cases, notably for the major defined benefit plans in
Germany, the plan is unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial
resources.
Current and past service costs are charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating
results. Pension plan administration and funding is overseen at a corporate level, and any settlement gains and
losses resulting from changes in funding arrangements are reported as general and administration expenses
within the Corporate business segment. The expected returns on plan assets and interest costs are charged to
financial income and financing costs, respectively. Actuarial gains and losses are recorded directly in equity. The
recognition of pension assets is limited to the total of the present value of any future refunds from the plans or
reductions in future contributions to the plans and any cumulative unrecognised past service costs. Adjustments
arising from the limit on the recognition of assets for defined benefit plans are recorded directly in equity.

The funding of the Group’s various defined benefit plans is overseen at a corporate level. Qualified independent
actuaries carry out valuations on a regular basis and for major plans annually as at the balance sheet date. For
funded plans, which are usually trusts independent of the Group’s finances, the net asset/liability recognised on
the Group’s balance sheet corresponds to the over/under funding of the plan, adjusted for unrecognised past
service costs. For unfunded plans, where the Group meets the pension obligations directly from its own financial
resources, a liability for the defined benefit obligation is recorded in the Group’s balance sheet. Pension assets
and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to
use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan. The recognition of pension assets is limited to
the present value of any future refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans and any
cumulative unrecognised past service costs. Amounts recognised in the balance sheet for post-employment
benefits are predominantly non-current and are reported in non-current assets and liabilities.

Finance Report 2006 61Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Actuarial assumptions
Actuarial assumptions are unbiased and mutually compatible estimates of variables that determine the ultimate
cost of providing post-employment benefits. They are set on an annual basis by local management and actuaries
and are subject to approval by corporate management and the Group’s actuaries. Actuarial assumptions consist
of demographic assumptions on matters such as mortality and employee turnover, and financial assumptions on
matters such as salary and benefit levels, interest rates, return on investments and costs of medical benefits. The
Group operates defined benefit plans in many countries and the actuarial assumptions vary based upon local
economic and social conditions.
Demographic assumptions: The most significant demographic assumptions relate to mortality rates. The
Group’s actuaries use mortality tables which take into account historic patterns and expected changes, such as
further increases in longevity. The mortality tables used for the major schemes are
• Germany: Heubeck tables 2005G
• Japan: National Census (No. 19 Life Table)
• Switzerland: Swiss BVG 2005
• United Kingdom: non-pensioners – PA92C25 rated down one year
• United Kingdom: pensioners – PA92C10 rated down one year
• United States: RP2000 projected to 2010
Rates of employee turnover, disability and early retirement are based on historical behaviour within Group
companies.
Financial assumptions:These are based on market expectations for the period over which the obligations are
to be settled. The ranges of assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the most significant plans, which
areincountries with stable currencies and interest rates, are shown below.
Defined benefit plans: financial actuarial assumptions
2006 2005
Weighted Weighted
average Range average Range
Discount rates 4.30% 2%–9% 3.74% 2%–9%
Expected rates of return on plan assets 5.82% 1%–9% 6.10% 2%–10%
Expected rates of salary increases 3.60% 2%–6% 2.94% 2%–9%
Medical cost trend rate 8.16% 7%–9% 7.20% 7%–10%
Discount rates, which are used to calculate the discounted present value of the defined benefit obligation, are
determined with reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds, or government bonds in countries
where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. The currency and term of the bonds is consistent with the
obligation being discounted. The interest cost included in the income statement is calculated by multiplying the
discount rate by the defined benefit obligation.
Expected returns on plan assets are based on market expectations of expected returns on the assets in funded
plans over the duration of the related obligation. This takes into account the split of the plan assets between
equities, bonds, property and other investments. The calculation includes assumptions concerning expected
dividend and interest income, realised and unrealised gains on plan assets and taxes and administration costs
borne by the plan. These are based on long-term market expectations and the actual performance is continually
monitored by corporate management. Due to the long-term nature of the obligations, the assumptions used for
matters such as returns on investments may not necessarily be consistent with recent historical patterns. The
expected return on plan assets included in the income statement is calculated by multiplying the expected rate
of return by the fair value of plan assets. The difference between the expected return and the actual return in any
twelve month period is an actuarial gain/loss and is recorded directly to equity. The actual return on plan assets
was 1,262 million Swiss francs (2005: 1,181 million Swiss francs).
Expected rates of salary increases, which are used to calculate the defined benefit obligation and the current
service cost included in the income statement, are based on the latest expectation and historical behaviour within
Group companies.
62 Finance Report 2006Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Medical cost trend rates are used to calculate the defined benefit obligation and the current service cost included
in the income statement of post-employment medical plans. These take into account the benefits set out in the
plan terms and expected future changes in medical costs. Since the Group’s major post-employment medical
plans are for US employees, these rates are driven by developments in the United States. The effect of one
percentage point increase or decrease in the medical cost trend rate is shown below.

Based on the most recent actuarial valuations, the Group expects that employer contributions for funded plans in
2007 will be approximately 210 million Swiss francs.
Amounts recorded in equity
The actuarial gains and losses recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense were gains of
761million Swiss francs (2005: losses of 552 million Swiss francs). The cumulative amount at 31 December 2006
was gains of 209 million Swiss francs. (2005: losses of 552 million Swiss francs).
In addition the recognition of pension assets is limited to the total of the present value of any future refunds from
the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans and the cumulative unrecognised past service costs.
Adjustments arising from this limit on asset recognition are recorded directly in equity. In 2006 this adjustment
was 396 million Swiss francs (2005: zero).

The Group operates several equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Genentech and Chugai.
Effective 1 January 2005 the Group adopted IFRS 2: ‘Share-based Payment’. Amongst other matters, the standard
requires that the fair value of all equity compensation plan awards granted to employees be estimated at grant
date and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. The expense is charged against the appropriate income

Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Roche Long-Term: During 2005 the Group implemented a new global long-term incentive programme which
is available to certain directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The
programme consists of Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) with the Group having the alternative
of granting awards under the existing Roche Option Plan.
Share option plans
Roche Option Plan:Awards under this plan give employees the right to purchase non-voting equity securities
at an exercise price specified at the grant date. The options, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have
a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years, subject to continued employment. The Group
covers such obligations by purchasing non-voting equity securities, or derivatives thereon (see Note 31). With
the introduction of Roche Long-Term in 2005, the number of options granted under the Roche Option Plan was
significantly reduced, as most eligible employees now receive Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights
instead.

In April 2004 Genentech’s shareholders approved an equity incentive plan. The plans allow for the granting of
various stock options, incentive stock options and stock purchase rights to employees, directors and consultants
of Genentech. No incentive stock options and stock purchase rights have been granted under this plan to date.
The options granted, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a ten-year duration and vest on a
phased basis over four years, subject to continued employment.

– expected dividend yield 3.17% 0% 1.1%
– early exercise factor 1.483 1.438 n/a
– expected exit rate 10.66% 8.39% 0%
Volatility was determined by reference to historically observed prices of the underlying equity. Risk-free interest
rates are derived from zero coupon swap rates at the grant date taken from Datastream. The early exercise factor
describes the ratio between the expected market price at the exercise date and the exercise price at which early
exercises can be expected, based on historically observed behaviour. For the Chugai grants in 2006 it was
assumed that all awards would be held for the full term length, since there was insufficient historically observed
early exercise behaviour.
Other equity compensation plans
Roche Connect: This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the United States and
certain other countries, to make regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting equity securities.
It is administered by independent third parties. The Group contributes to the programme, which allows the
employees to purchase non-voting equity securities at a discount (usually 20%). The administrator purchases the
necessary non-voting equity securities directly from the market. At 31 December 2006 the administrator held
911 thousand non-voting equity securities (2005: 713 thousand). The programme has been operational since
1 October 2002. During the year the cost of the plan was 11 million Swiss francs (2005: 9 million Swiss francs),
which was reported within the relevant expenditure line by function.
Genentech Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP): Genentech has an employee stock purchase
programme that allows employees to purchase Genentech’s common stock at 85% of the lower of market value
at the grant date or purchase date. In 2006 a total of 1.9 million shares of Genentech common stock were
purchased (2005: 1.9 million shares) resulting in a cash inflow of 121 million Swiss francs (2005: 93 million Swiss
francs). During the year the cost of the plan was 42 million Swiss francs (2005: 27 million Swiss francs), which was
reported within the relevant expenditure line by function.

Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights:With the introduction of Roche Long-Term in 2005, the Group
offers Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) to certain directors, management and employees
selected at the discretion of the Group. The S-SARs give employees the right to receive non-voting equity
securities reflecting the value of any appreciation in the market price of the non-voting equity securities between
the grant date and the exercise date. The options, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a seven-
year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years, subject to continued employment. The Group covers
such obligations by purchasing non-voting equity securities, or derivatives thereon (see Note 31).

The weighted average fair value of the options granted in 2006 was calculated using a binomial model. The inputs
to the model were consistent with those used for the Roche Option Plan 2006 awards given previously. The
resulting weighted average fair value per right is CHF 36.45, giving a total fair value of 101 million Swiss francs
which is charged over the vesting period of three years.
Roche Performance Share Plan:The Group offers future non-voting equity security awards (or at the Board’s
discretion, their cash equivalent) to certain directors and key senior managers. The programme was established
at the beginning of 2002 and was in effect for three years.
During 2004 the Board approved a new three-year cycle of the Roche Performance Share Plan (PSP) to operate
during 2005–2007. The amount of non-voting equity securities allocated will depend upon the individual’s salary
level, the achievement of performance targets linked to the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (shares and non-
voting equity securities combined) relative to the Group’s peers during the three-year period from the date of the
grant, and the discretion of the Board of Directors. For the 2005–2007 cycle a total of 231 thousand awards have
been made. These are non-tradable equity-settled awards. Each award will result in between zero and two non-
voting equity securities, depending upon the achievement of the performance targets, being allocated to the
recipients in February 2008. The fair value per one unit of PSP from the 2005–2007 cycle is CHF 145.39, giving a
total fair value of 34 million Swiss francs which is charged over the vesting period of three years.
68 Finance Report 2006Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
During 2005 the Board approved a further three-year cycle of the Roche Performance Share Plan (PSP) to operate
during 2006–2008. The terms and conditions are similar to the 2005–2007 cycle. For the 2006–2008 cycle a total
of 54 thousand awards have been made. These are non-tradable equity-settled awards. Each award will result in
between zero and two non-voting equity securities, depending upon the achievement of the performance targets,
being allocated to the recipients in February 2009. The weighted average fair value of the awards granted in 2006
was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The input parameters to the model were the covariance matrix
between Roche and the other individual companies of the peer group based on a three-year history and a risk-
free rate of 1.93%. The valuation also takes into account the defined rank and performance structure which
determines the payout of the PSP. The resulting value per one unit of PSP from the 2006–2008 cycle is CHF 210.06,
giving a total fair value of 11 million Swiss francs which is charged over the vesting period of three years.
Roche Stock Appreciation Rights: Some employees of certain North American subsidiaries of the Group
receive Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) as part of their compensation. The SARs, which are non-tradable cash-
settled awards, may be exercised after a vesting period of between one and three years for a cash payment, based
upon the amount by which the market price of the Group’s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) at the point
ofexercise exceeds the strike price (grant price at issuance). Following the implementation of Roche Long-Term
(see above), the Group does not plan to award any further cash-settled SARs and no awards were made in 2005
or 2006.

with those used for the Roche Option Plan 2006 awards given previously.

Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the use
of the asset and its eventual disposal. Factors such as changes in the planned use of buildings, machinery or
equipment, or closure of facilities, the presence or absence of competition and technical obsolescence could
result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
Leasing arrangements where the Group is the lessee
Finance leases: As at 31 December 2006 the capitalised cost of property, plant and equipment under finance
leases was 182 million Swiss francs (2005: 199 million Swiss francs) and the net book value of these assets was
79 million Swiss francs (2005: 106 million Swiss francs).

Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Goodwill impairment testing
Pharmaceuticals Division:The division’s reportable business segments are the cash-generating units used for
the testing of goodwill. For Genentech and Chugai, the recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs to
sell, determined with reference to the publicly quoted share prices of Genentech and Chugai shares. The goodwill
in the Roche Pharmaceuticals business is not significant in comparison with the Group’s total carrying amount of
goodwill.
Diagnostics Division: The division’s business areas are the cash-generating units used for the testing of
goodwill. The goodwill arising from the Corange/Boehringer Mannheim acquisition is recorded and monitored at
a divisional level as it cannot be meaningfully allocated to the division’s business areas. Therefore the cash-
generating unit for this goodwill is the entire division. The recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is
based on value in use. The cash flow projections used are based on the most recent business plans approved by
management. These assume no significant changes in the organisation of the division and include management’s
latest estimates on sales volume and pricing, and production and other operating costs. These reflect past
experience and are projected over five years. The discount rate used is based on a rate of 7.5%, which is derived
from a capital asset pricing model using data from Swiss capital markets, including Swiss Federal Government
10-year bonds and the SMI index. This is then adjusted to a pre-tax rate of 11.4%. Management believes that any
reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would not cause the carrying value of goodwill to
exceed the recoverable amount.

Included in the Roche Pharmaceuticals business segment are intangible assets with a carrying value of
393 million Swiss francs and a remaining amortisation period of 1–2 years that relate to the purchase by the
Group of the global rights to Kytril (granisetron). The Diagnostics business segment includes intangible assets
with a carrying value of 1,744 million Swiss francs and a remaining amortisation period of 11 years that relate
to the acquisition of Corange/Boehringer Mannheim and intangible assets with a carrying value of 567 million
Swiss francs and a remaining amortisation period of 10 years that relate to the acquisition of Igen. Intangible
assets that are not yet available for use, which mostly arise from the Group’s in-licensing arrangements, total
778 million Swiss francs. Of this total, 632 million Swiss francs relate to the Roche Pharmaceuticals business
segment. The Group currently has no internally generated intangible assets from development as the criteria for
the recognition as an asset are not met. Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future
cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal. Factors such as the presence or
absence of competition, technical obsolescence or lower than anticipated sales for products with capitalised
rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
In the second half of 2006 the Group recorded impairment charges of 184 million Swiss francs relating to
intangible assets in the Diagnostics Division. These followed the regular updating of the division’s business plans
and technology assessments in the second half of 2006, which indicated anticipated recoverable amounts that
were below the current carrying values for certain assets. These mainly concern certain of the intangible assets
recorded following the Disetronic acquisition in 2003. These assets were written down to their recoverable
amount, based on a value in use calculation using a discount rate of 10.0%. Additionally the remaining useful life
of these assets was reassessed and has been reduced from 6.3 years to 3 years, effective 31 December 2006.
Consequent to these matters, the Group expects that the 2007 amortisation charge for intangible assets in the
Diagnostics Division will be approximately 20 million Swiss francs lower than it would otherwise have been.
In the Roche Pharmaceuticals business segment an impairment charge of 13 million Swiss francs was recorded
in the second half of 2006, which relates to a decision to terminate development of one compound with an alliance
partner. The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written-down by this charge.

Financial long-term assets are held for strategic purposes and are classified as non-current. The available-for-
sale investments are mainly equity investments. Unquoted equity investments classified as available-for-sale are
generally measured at cost, as their fair value cannot be measured reliably. These are primarily investments in
private biotechnology companies, which are kept as part of the Group’s strategic alliance efforts. The carrying
value of equity investments held at cost is 27 million Swiss francs (2005: 24 million Swiss francs). The average
effective interest rate of held-to-maturity investments is 4.7% (2005: 3.7%). Loans receivable comprise all loans
to third parties with a term of over one year. Restricted cash primarily consists of the surety bond posted by
Genentech in connection with the City of Hope litigation (see Note 7). As at 31 December 2006 this was
963million Swiss francs (2005: 966 million Swiss francs).

27. Derivative financial instruments
In appropriate circumstances the Group uses derivative financial instruments as part of its risk management
and trading strategies. This is discussed in Note 2. Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value.
Themethods used for determining fair value are described in Note 1.

Hedge accounting
The Group’s accounting policy on hedge accounting, which is described in Note 1, requires that to qualify for
hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability of
occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
As described in Note 2, the Group has financial risk management policies for foreign exchange risk, interest rate
risk, market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. When deemed appropriate, certain of the above risks are managed
through the use of derivatives. While many of these transactions can be considered as hedges in economic terms,
if the required conditions are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case
the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship,
which means that any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial
income.
The Group generally limits the use of hedge accounting to certain significant transactions. Consequently as at
31December 2006 the Group has no fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investment in a foreign
entity that meet the strict requirements to qualify for hedge accounting, apart from those described below.
Genentech has hedged some of its fixed-term debt instruments with interest rate swaps. As at 31 December 2006
such instruments, which have been designated and qualify as fair value hedges, are recorded in the balance sheet
as a liability with a fair value of 13 million Swiss francs (2005: liability of 10 million Swiss francs).
Genentech has non-US dollar cash flows from future royalty income and development expenses expected over
the next one to five years. To hedge part of this transaction exposure Genentech enters into derivative financial
instruments such as options and forward contracts. Genentech has equity investments in various biotechnology
companies that are subject to a greater risk of market fluctuation than the stock market in general. To manage
part of this exposure Genentech enters into derivative financial instruments such as zero cost collars and forward
contracts. As at 31 December 2006 such instruments, which are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, are
recorded as assets with a fair value of 64 million Swiss francs and as liabilities with a fair value of 4 million Swiss
francs (2005: assets of 153 million Swiss francs). These matters are also described in Genentech’s annual report
and quarterly SEC filings.
Movements on the fair value reserve for designated cash flow hedges are included in Note 31.

Finance Report 2006 79Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Environmental and legal provisions
These provisions include 186 million Swiss francs (2005: 212 million Swiss francs) for environmental matters and
1,320 million Swiss francs (2005: 1,366 million Swiss francs) for litigation, including major legal cases and the
vitamin case.
Provisions for environmental matters include various separate environmental issues in a number of countries.
Approximately half of these were pre-existing in companies acquired by the Group. By their nature the amounts
and timing of any outflows are difficult to predict. The Group estimates that approximately half of the amount
provided for may result in cash outflows over the next five years. Significant provisions are discounted by between
5% and 6%.
Legal provisions consist mainly of the major legal cases as described in Note 7. The amounts, timing and
uncertainties of any outflows are discussed in those notes, as are the discount rates used. The remaining legal
provisions, which account for less than 5% of the balance, consist of a number of other separate legal matters in
various Group companies. The majority of any cash outflows are expected to occur within the next one to three
years, although these are dependent on the development of the various litigations. These provisions are not
discounted as the time value of money is not material in these matters.
Restructuring provisions
These arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of business undertaken by the Group or
the manner in which business is conducted. Such provisions include only the costs necessarily entailed by the
restructuring which are not associated with the recurring activities of the Group. The remaining amounts are
mostly in respect of obligations towards former employees arising from the Pharmaceuticals Division
restructuring and other previous restructuring plans. The timings of these cash outflows are reasonably certain
on a global basis and are shown in the table above. Significant provisions are discounted by 3%.
Other provisions
Other provisions consist mostly of claims arising from trade, sales returns, certain employee benefit obligations
and various other provisions from Group companies that do not fit into the above categories. The timings of cash
outflows are by their nature uncertain and the best estimates are shown in the table above. Significant provisions
are discounted by between 4% and 6%.
Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees, to be affected by
political, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating to environmental protection, in
the countries in which it operates. The industries in which the Group operates are also subject to other risks of
various kinds. The nature and frequency of these developments and events, not all of which are covered by
insurance, as well as their effect on future operations and earnings, are not predictable. See also Note 7 in respect
of major legal cases.
The Group has entered into strategic alliances with various companies in order to gain access to potential new
products or to utilise other companies to help develop the Group’s own potential new products. Potential future
payments may become due to certain collaboration partners achieving certain milestones as defined in the
collaboration agreements. The Group’s best estimate of future commitments for such payments is 334 million
Swiss francs in 2007, 160 million Swiss francs in 2008 and 121 million Swiss francs in 2009.

The ‘LYONs V’ zero coupon US dollar exchangeable notes (see below) are reflected as due the first year that

The fair value of the debt instruments is 7.7 billion Swiss francs (2005: 9.2 billion Swiss francs) and the fair value
of total debt is 8.6 billion Swiss francs (2005: 10.3 billion Swiss francs). This is calculated based on the observable
market prices of the debt instruments or the present value of the future cash flows on the instrument, discounted
at a market rate of interest for instruments with similar credit status, cash flows and maturity periods.
There are no pledges on the Group’s assets in connection with debt.
Amounts due to banks and other financial institutions
These amounts are denominated in various currencies, notably Canadian dollars, Swiss francs, South African rand
and Brazilian real. The average interest rate was 6.1%. The average interest rate in 2005 was 3.0%, when the
balance was primarily denominated in euros. Repayment dates are up to four years and 442 million Swiss francs
(2005: 224 million Swiss francs) are due within one year.

Fair Value Option
In 2005 the Group applied the Fair Value Option on three of its outstanding debt instruments on which the Group
had been applying fair value hedge accounting in the past. These debt instruments are the ‘European Medium
Term Note programme’ Euro bonds, the ‘Chameleon’ US dollar bonds and the ‘Rodeo’ Swiss franc bonds. The Fair
Value Option treatment is based on the elimination of an accounting mismatch which had been recognised
between the hedging swaps (reported at fair value) and the hedged bonds (reported at amortised cost). The
difference between the carrying value and the principal amount for these debt instruments totals 14 million Swiss
francs (2005: 68 million Swiss francs).
Issues of new debt instruments
On 18 July 2005 Genentech completed a private placement of 2 billion US dollars aggregate principal amount
of Senior Notes. The placement consisted of 500 million US dollars of 4.40% Senior Notes due 2010, 1 billion
US dollars of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2015 and 500 million US dollars of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2035. The
Senior Notes contain certain restrictive covenants on incurring property liens and entering into sale and
leaseback transactions.

Partial conversion of ‘LYONs V’ US dollar exchangeable notes:During 2006 notes with a carrying value of
680 million US dollars (853 million Swiss francs) were converted into 6.3 million non-voting equity securities. The
notes called for conversion during 2006 represent 58% of the number of notes outstanding at the start of the year.
A total of 354 million Swiss francs were recorded to equity, which consists of the 1,264 million Swiss francs of
cash used to purchase the non-voting equity securities used in the conversion, less the 853 million Swiss francs
carrying value of the converted bonds and the related tax effects of 57 million Swiss francs.
Partial conversion of ‘Series 6 Chugai Pharmaceutical Unsecured Convertible Bonds’:During 2006 bonds
with a face value of 0.3 billion Japanese yen (3 million Swiss francs) were converted to shares of Chugai. The
Group’s percentage ownership of Chugai was unaffected by this conversion, as the Group has bonds convertible
into Chugai shares that mirror those that Chugai has outstanding with third parties.
Repayments, redemptions and conversions of debt instruments – 2005
Redemption of ‘Sumo’ Japanese yen exchangeable bonds: On the due date of 25 March 2005 the Group
redeemed these bonds at the original issue amount plus accrued original issue discount (OID). The effective
interest rate of these bonds was 1.89%. The cash outflow was 1,178 million Swiss francs. There was no gain or
loss recorded on the redemption.
Partial conversion and repurchase of ‘LYONs V’ US dollar exchangeable notes: On 25 January 2005 the
Group repurchased at the option of the bondholders a total of 0.7 million US dollars nominal value of notes for a
total consideration of 0.4 million US dollars (0.4 million Swiss francs) which was equal to the carrying value of
these notes. During 2005 notes with a carrying value of 0.1 million Swiss francs were converted into 1,066 non-
voting equity securities. The notes repurchased and called for conversion during 2005 represented 0.04% of the
number of notes outstanding at the start of the year. This had no material impact on the financial statements.
Partial conversion of ‘Series 6 Chugai Pharmaceutical Unsecured Convertible Bonds’:During 2005 bonds
with a face value of 1.4 billion Japanese yen (16 million Swiss francs) were converted to shares of Chugai. The
Group’s percentage ownership of Chugai was unaffected by this conversion, as the Group has bonds convertible
into Chugai shares that mirror those that Chugai has outstanding with third parties.

in whole or in part at any time after 25 July 2007 at the issue price plus accrued original issue discount (OID).
Ifthe notes outstanding at 31 December 2006 were all exchanged it would require 4.6 million non-voting equity
securities to meet the obligation.
Finance Report 2006 83Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
‘Series 6 Chugai Pharmaceutical Unsecured Convertible Bonds’: Each bond of JPY 1,000,000 par value is
convertible into 1,311 shares of Chugai. Conversion is at the option of the bondholder and may be made at any
time up to 29 September 2008. The bonds will be redeemable at maturity on 30 September 2008 at the issue price.
If the bonds outstanding at 31 December 2006 were all converted it would require 198 thousand Chugai shares
to meet the obligation. The Group’s percentage ownership in Chugai would not be affected by any conversion, as
the Group has bonds convertible into Chugai shares that mirror those that Chugai has outstanding with third
parties.

Non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
As of 31 December 2006, 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities were in issue as in the preceding year. Under
Swiss company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value, are not part of the share capital
and cannot be issued against a contribution which would be shown as an asset in the balance sheet of Roche
Holding Ltd. Each non-voting equity security confers the same rights as any of the shares to participate in the net
profit and any remaining proceeds from liquidation following repayment of the nominal value of the shares and,
if any, participation certificates. In accordance with the law and the Articles of Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd,
the Company is entitled at all times to exchange all or some of the non-voting equity securities into shares or
participation certificates.
Dividends
On 27 February 2006 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of CHF 2.50 per share and non-
voting equity security (2005: CHF 2.00) in respect of the 2005 business year. The distribution to holders of
outstanding shares and non-voting equity securities totalled 2,152 million Swiss francs (2005: 1,721 million Swiss
francs) and has been recorded against retained earnings in 2005. The Board has proposed dividends for the
2006 business year of 3.40 Swiss francs per share and non-voting equity security. This is subject to approval at
theAnnual General Meeting on 5 March 2007.

Non-voting equity securities and Low Exercise Price Options are mainly held for the potential conversion
obligations that may arise from the Group’s convertible debt instruments (see Note 30). The Group’s potential
obligations to employees for the Roche Option Plan and Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (see
Note 14) are covered by call options that are exercisable at any time up to their maturity. The Group also holds
aresidual number of options that were purchased for use in the Group’s previous option compensation scheme,
which is now closed.
Following from the conversion in 2006 of 58% of the convertible debt instruments outstanding at the start of the
year (see Note 30), the Group reduced its holdings in own equity instruments during the year. The net cash inflow
from transactions in own equity instruments was 1,367 million Swiss francs (2005: net cash inflow of 779 million
Swiss francs).
The Group holds none of its own shares.

32. Earnings per share and non-voting equity security
Basic earnings per share and non-voting equity security
For the calculation of basic earnings per share and non-voting equity security, the number of shares and non-
voting equity securities is reduced by the weighted average number of its own non-voting equity securities held
by the Group during the period.

Diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security, the net income and weighted
average number of shares and non-voting equity securities outstanding are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive
potential shares and non-voting equity securities.
Potential dilutive effects arise from the convertible debt instruments and the employee stock option plans. If the
outstanding convertible debt instruments were to be converted then this would lead to a reduction in interest
expense and an increase in the number of shares which may have a net dilutive effect on the earnings per share.
The exercise of outstanding vested employee stock options would have a dilutive effect. The exercise of the
outstanding vested Genentech employee stock options would have a dilutive effect if the net income of
Genentech is positive. The diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security reflects the potential impacts
of these dilutive effects on the earnings per share figures.

35. Cash flow statement
Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities arise from the Group’s primary activities in the Pharmaceuticals and
Diagnostics businesses. These are calculated by the indirect method by adjusting the Group’s operating profit for
any operating income and expenses that are not cash flows (for example depreciation, amortisation and
impairment) in order to derive the cash generated from operations. This and other operating cash flows are shown
in the cash flow statement. Operating cash flows also include income taxes paid on all activities, including, for
example, the taxes paid on the income from bond conversion and redemption.

Cash flows from investing activities
Cash flows from investing activities are principally those arising from the Group’s investments in property, plant
and equipment and intangible assets, and from the acquisition and divestment of subsidiaries, associated
companies and businesses. Cash flows connected with the Group’s portfolio of marketable securities and other
investments are also included, as are any interest and dividend payments received in respect of these securities
and investments. These cash flows indicate the Group’s net reinvestment in its operating assets and the cash
flow effects of business combinations and divestments, as well as the cash generated by the Group’s other
investments.

Cash flows from financing activities
Cash flows from financing activities are primarily the proceeds from the issue and repayment of the Group’s equity
and debt instruments. They also include interest payments and dividend payments on these instruments. Cash
flows from short-term financing, including finance leases, are also included. These cash flows indicate the
Group’s transactions with the providers of its equity and debt financing. Cash flows from short-term borrowings
are shown as a net movement, as these consist of a large number of transactions with short maturity.

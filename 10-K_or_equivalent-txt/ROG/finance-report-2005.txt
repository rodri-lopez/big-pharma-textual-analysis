The 2005 annual results show a strong operating performance both in terms of top-line growth as well as profit
margins, mainly driven by the Pharmaceuticals Division.
Total sales grew by 19% in local currencies (20% in Swiss francs; 20% in US dollars) to 35.5 billion Swiss francs,
with the Pharmaceuticals Division contributing 77% to Group sales and the Diagnostics Division representing
23%. The incremental sales increase of 6 billion Swiss francs was achieved through organic growth and primarily
driven by strong demand for the Group’s oncology drugs Avastin, MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin and by the
anti-influenza drug Tamiflu. In absolute terms the increase from sales of Avastin more than compensated for the
marked decline of Rocephin sales following patent expiry in the United States in July 2005.
The Group’s operating profit before exceptional items increased by 33% to 9 billion Swiss francs. The
corresponding operating profit margin increased by 2.5 percentage points to 25.4%, mainly as a result of the
strong sales growth. This margin increase was achieved at the same time as both divisions continued to increase
investments in launch and pre-launch activities as well as in the strong development pipeline. In addition gains
on product divestments were 371 million Swiss francs lower than in 2004.
The reporting of the costs of the Group’s equity compensation plans for employees as operating expenses did not
have a significant overall impact, as the increasing costs were more than compensated for by the improved
underlying results. Excluding the equity compensation plan costs for Genentech (which is by far the largest plan
in the Group), the Group operating profit margin before exceptional items would have been 26.2% (2004: 23.4%).
The exchange rate impact on sales and operating profit growth was very minor. The average exchange rates for
the US dollar and the euro in 2005 were basically at the same levels as in 2004. The Japanese yen was more than
1% lower on average compared to 2004.

Pharmaceuticals operating results
The Pharmaceuticals Division increased its sales strongly by 25% in local currencies (26% in Swiss francs;
25% in US dollars) to 27.3 billion Swiss francs, outpacing global market growth by four times. Operating profit
before exceptional items was 7.5 billion Swiss francs, representing growth of 37%. Consequently there was
amargin increase of 2.4 percentage points to 27.4%.
Marketing support was significant for important products such as MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin, Avastin and
Pegasys+Copegus. Launch and pre-launch activities, notably for Tarceva and Boniva were also significant, as was
the continued investment in the strong development pipeline. All Pharmaceuticals sub-divisions (Roche
Pharmaceuticals, Genentech and Chugai) contributed to the improved operating results. Excluding the equity
compensation plan costs for Genentech, the Pharmaceuticals operating profit margin before exceptional items
would have been 28.4% (2004: 25.6%), and Genentech’s operating profit margin before exceptional items would
have been 36.5% (2004: 31.9%).

Sales: The major growth drivers were again key products in the oncology, transplantation and virology franchises
(including Tamiflu), with all franchises significantly outpacing their respective markets. The renal anemia
franchise grew modestly after a slight decline in 2004.

1) excluding Tamiflu.
Almost all product lines showed sales growth. This was especially notable for the Top 10 Pharmaceuticals
products, which had a strong growth of 32% in 2005, and the Top 20 products which grew by 31%. Of the Top 20
products only two (Rocephin and Dilatrend) were in decline, due to patent expiry in 2005 and 2004, respectively.
The growth and profitability of the Pharmaceuticals Division is primarily due to eleven products (Tamiflu, Avastin,
MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin, Tarceva, CellCept, Xeloda, Pegasys+Copegus, Xolair and NeoRecormon/Epogin)
representing 62% of the portfolio (2004: 54%; 2003: 47%). Together they generated over 5 billion Swiss francs of
additional sales.

MabThera/Rituxan: The increase was primarily driven by higher MabThera sales volumes in markets in both
Europe and the rest of the world due to increased market penetration in both indolent and aggressive non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma. An application to expand the product’s indications to include maintenance treatment of
indolent non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma was filed in the EU in December 2005, as planned.
6 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Financial Review
NeoRecormon/Epogin: Sales growth in Europe was mainly driven by increased use in the oncology setting
(once weekly 30,000 IU pre-filled syringe), which compensated for continued price erosion in renal anemia
indications. NeoRecormon sales in oncology increased by 21% compared to 9% market growth. In Japan, Epogin
has grown 4%, in line with the market.
Herceptin: Growth was strong in both the US and Europe, driven by extension of treatment duration and
increased first-line penetration. In addition, clinical data showing significant efficacy in adjuvant breast cancer
has led to growing adoption in this unapproved area. The Group plans to file for this indication in the first quarter
of 2006.
CellCept: Growth was supported by all regions. CellCept continued to be the clear market leader in the
mycophenolic acid (MPA) market, with a market share of more than 95%.
Avastin: Sales growth was driven by strong and increasing uptake in the treatment of colorectal cancer, both the
first-line and relapsed/refractory settings. Following approval in the EU in January, Avastin has been launched in
all key countries, with Germany the major sales contributor. In 2006, the Group plans filings to extend the EU label
to match the US label, along with filings in both metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic
breast cancer based on the excellent clinical data received earlier in the year.
Tamiflu: Sales were driven by pandemic stockpiling by governments (51% of sales), along with commercial and
seasonal sales (49% of sales). By the end of 2005 more than 60 countries had placed orders for pandemic
supplies, with delivery spread over 2005 to 2007. Revenue on the Tamiflu pandemic contracts is recognised when
the risks and rewards of ownership of the product are transferred to the customer. This is on delivery to the
customer, or in the case of ‘bill-and-hold’ arrangements prior to final delivery to the customer if the inventory is
specifically identified, ready for delivery and cannot be used for delivery to other customers.
Pegasys+Copegus: Pegasys now has a 56% share of the global pegylated interferon market. The sales increase
was drivenby higher Pegasys sales volumes in European markets due to both market share increase and market
expansion based on the new indications in hepatitis B virus, normal ALT and co-infection with HIV. US sales
increased modestly including a single-digit price increase during 2005. A marketing application for combined
Pegasys andCopegus for hepatitis C has been designated for priority review by the Japanese regulatory agency
(MHLW).
Xeloda: Continued growth was achieved in all regions and was primarily driven by obtaining approval in a new
indication, the adjuvant monotherapy treatment of colon cancer, which was received in the EU in April and the
US in June 2005.
Xolair: Sales growth was driven by an increase of the patient and prescriber base and, to some extent, a price
increase effective from 21 July 2005. Xolair is a humanized anti-IgE antibody approved for the treatment of
moderate-to-severe persistent allergic asthma in adults and adolescents.
Tarceva: The major contributor to sales was the US, where Tarceva was approved in November 2004 for the
treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after failure of
atleast one prior chemotherapy regimen. Swiss and Canadian approvals were received in March 2005 and July
2005 respectively. European approval was received in September 2005 and Tarceva has since been launched
inGermany, France and the UK. Tarceva will be launched in other EU countries after reimbursement approvals in
2006. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Tarceva for the treatment of inoperable or metastatic
pancreatic cancer in November 2005 and Roche filed an application for this indication with EU regulators in
October 2005.
Rocephin: As expected, sales declined markedly following the expiry of the product’s US patent in July 2005.
More information on the products and pipeline can be found in the appropriate sections in the Business Report.
Finance Report 2005 7Roche Group
Financial Review
Sales by region: Sales continued to grow in all major regions. In North America, sales grew more than five times
faster than the market, driven by products marketed by Genentech (Avastin, MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin,
Tarceva and Xolair) as well as Tamiflu, CellCept and Xeloda. Together these more than compensated for the
300million Swiss francs decline in sales of Rocephin following US patent expiry in July 2005. In Europe the Group
continued to gain market share, driven by continuing strong sales growth of Tamiflu, MabThera/Rituxan,
Herceptin, Avastin, Pegasys, NeoRecormon, Xeloda and CellCept. Sales growth in Japan was primarily driven by
Tamiflu, due to a late, severe influenza season in 2004/05 and an early influenza season in 2005/06, as well as
Neutrogin, Epogin, Herceptin and Pegasys. Overall sales in Japan grew close to three times faster than the
Japanese market.

Japan 3,699 14 +17
Other regions 3,911 14 +17
Total 27,268 100 +25
Royalties and other operating income:The decrease was due to lower gains on product divestments in 2005
(55 million Swiss francs) compared to 429 million Swiss francs in 2004, which included the disposal of Soriatane.
This was partly offset by higher royalty income, notably at Genentech due to a new licence arrangement with
ImClone on sales of Erbitux. Included within this was a one-time payment relating to royalties on Erbitux sales
from the launch of the product in 2004 until the signing of the agreement in January 2005. Royalty income at
Genentech also increased due to higher sales by various other licensees on other products. There was also higher
out-licensing income at Roche Pharmaceuticals, in particular milestone income following the FDA approval for
Boniva in the United States.
Cost of sales: The increase of 25% in local currencies was in line with the 25% increase in sales due to the
economies of scale in production including the benefits from focussing on a smaller number of production sites,
continuing productivity improvements and some product mix effects. These factors more than compensated
for the 48% increase in royalty expenses on product sales to 1,294 million Swiss francs from 872 million Swiss
francs in 2004, driven by the success of products such as MabThera/Rituxan, Tarceva, Xolair and in particular
Tamiflu.
Marketing and distribution:These costs increased by 18% in local currencies. This is lower than the growth in
sales, even taking into account the ongoing strong support for established products, for global launch activities
for newly launched products such as Avastin, Tarceva and Boniva and for pre-launch costs for products such as
MabThera/Rituxan in rheumatoid arthritis and Lucentis. Marketing and distribution as a percentage of sales
declined by 1.7 percentage points to 27.4% compared to 2004.
Research and development:The increase of over 500 million Swiss francs, or 12% in local currencies, to almost
5 billion Swiss francs reflects the ongoing clinical development of the product pipeline and higher expenses for
early-stage projects. Research and development costs as a percentage of sales were 18.3% in 2005, down
2.2 percentage points from the ratio in the comparative period, which included a substantial amount for the
in-licensing of the late-stage development and commercialisation of JTT-705, Japan Tobacco’s innovative
cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor, for the treatment of dyslipidemia.
8 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Financial Review
General and administration:The overall increase of over 400 million Swiss francs, or 32% in local currencies,
is due to several items. The Gilead retrospective adjustments relating to 2001–2004, higher SAP implementation
costs at Genentech, a charitable contribution by Genentech, lower gains on the disposal of property, plant and
equipment, the transition impacts of expensing equity compensation plans at Genentech and higher restructuring
costs for Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai, each contributed between two and three percentage points to
the growth. Excluding all of these items, general and administration costs grew by 18%, which was less than
the growth in sales. This increase was driven by the creation of new businesses in Eastern Europe in Roche
Pharmaceuticals and an alignment of the infrastructure at Genentech, both arising from the continuing strong
growth of the business.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets: The decline is solely due to Genentech. Firstly, some
intangible assets were fully amortised by mid-2004 and some others by mid-2005. Secondly, Genentech decided
to stop commercialisation of Nutropin Depot, which resulted in an impairment of the Nutropin Depot intangible
assets of 23 million Swiss francs in 2004. Thirdly, Genentech impaired an in-licensed compound in 2004 (6 million
Swiss francs).

Overall the Pharmaceuticals Division showed strong sales increases in all sub-divisions, which resulted in
improved operating margins. The margin at Genentech was adversely impacted by the expensing of employee
stock options. Excluding this the margin would have increased by 4.6 percentage points. At Chugai the improved
sales performance, particularly for Tamiflu, and beneficial impacts on the overall cost structure following Chugai’s
early retirement plan that was implemented in the second half of 2004, were the main drivers to the margin
improvement. Additional information on the Pharmaceuticals Division’s sub-divisional results is given in Note 3
to the Consolidated Financial Statements and further information on Genentech and Chugai is given in Notes 4
and 5.
Diagnostics operating results
The Diagnostics Division increased its sales to 8.2 billion Swiss francs, growing 4% in local currencies (5% in
Swiss francs; 5% in US dollars) while maintaining its leading market position. The operating profit before
exceptional items decreased by 1% in local currencies to 1.7 billion Swiss francs. The margin of 20.5% was still
well above industry average, although there was a margin decline of 0.8 percentage points. This was primarily
dueto heavy price pressure in the market. Additionally there was a higher relative cost of sales growth driven by
start-up costs for new manufacturing facilities and new products as well as higher depreciation from an increased
volume of instrument placements.

Sales: Major drivers of sales growth were again Centralized Diagnostics (Immunochemistry) and Molecular
Diagnostics. A number of key diagnostics products were launched during 2005, which helped contribute to
slightly increased growth during the second half of 2005. These included the launch of a complete new product
portfolio in Diabetes Care and innovative product offerings in new market segments such as DNA sequencing.

Diabetes Care: Diabetes Care maintained its number one position with sales of blood glucose monitoring
meters, strips and lancets increasing by 3% in local currencies to 2.7 billion Swiss francs, while insulin delivery
sales grew by 7% to 184 million Swiss francs. With the exception of the US, growth was stronger in the second
half of 2005 due to the launching of five new products which completely rejuvenated the Accu-Chek portfolio.
The new Accu-Chek Aviva meter completed global launching in October 2005, and is on track to reverse the
market share decline during 2004/5 from the maturation of the Accu-Chek Advantage line. Accu-Chek Compact
Plus remains the only meter on the market integrating measuring, test strip and lancet in one device, and is rapidly
growing this new segment. Rollout is nearly complete, with the US launch planned for the first quarter of 2006.
The global launch of Accu-Chek Multiclix – incorporating six lancets – is almost complete and further strengthens
the Group’s range in this area. In insulin delivery, the Group increased market share in Germany to 70% following
the successful launch of the Accu-Chek Spirit pump and Accu-Chek FlexLink infusion set. In the US, the business
area is ready to launch new insulin pumps to customers as soon as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
provides the go-ahead.
Centralized Diagnostics: Sales increased by 5% in local currencies to 2.9 billion Swiss francs despite ongoing
price pressure in the laboratory segment. Immunochemistry sales increased by 15% to 1.0 billion Swiss francs and
placements of the Elecsys E170 platforms increased by 24% due to an aggressive placement strategy and the
increasing demand for the cardiac test Elecsys proBNP. Although clinical chemistry was affected by pricing
pressures, the business area assumed market leadership in the clinical laboratory segment in the third quarter.

Molecular Diagnostics: Blood screening continued to provide the majority of the growth with an increase of
11% in local currencies to 311 million Swiss francs. This was due to a decreased pool size in Japan, combined
with two of the German Red Cross centres and Korea coming on-line. Additionally there was FDA clearance of
the Cobas AmpliScreen HBV Test for screening blood and plasma and the AmpliScreen HIV, HBV and HCV tests
for expanded use in screening living and cadaveric organ and tissue donations. Sales in virology grew by 8% in
local currencies to 528 million Swiss francs supported by the introduction of new fully automated platforms which
helped maintain market share and overcome pricing pressures.
Near Patient Testing: Coagulation sales increased by 13% in local currencies to 183 million Swiss francs, due to
increasing adoption of testing in doctors’ offices in the US along with the growing trend towards patient self-
monitoring. Blood gas/electrolytes sales rose by 10% in local currencies to 124 million Swiss francs due to strong
placements of blood gas/electrolyte instruments, particularly in Japan and Latin America. Sales of the Cardiac
Reader grew 5% in local currencies to 61 million Swiss francs with the launch of the Cardiac NT-proBNP test in
the second half of 2005 starting to have an impact. Introduction of the new self-coagulation monitoring device
CoaguChek XS commenced in pilot countries in the third quarter of 2005.
Applied Science: The Life Science market grew by 6%. However, due to a strong competitive environment,
business area sales experienced slightly lower growth at 5%. This year saw a number of major product launches,
particularly the launch of the new, high-throughput LightCycler 480 system and entrance for the first time into
the profitable DNA sequencing market with the launch of the Genome Sequencer 20 System through an exclusive
distribution agreement with 454 Life Sciences.
Sales by regions: Sales continued to grow ahead of the local market in all regions with the exception of North
America where sales declined slightly. Sales in this region were primarily affected by declining sales in Diabetes
Care. During 2005 Roche became the leading diagnostics supplier in Japan.

1) Europe, Middle East and Africa (excl. Iberia).
Royalties and other operating income: At 271 million Swiss francs, royalty and other operating income
remained basically at 2004 levels. However, royalty income alone declined by over 45% to 146 million Swiss
francsdue to the expiry of foundational PCR patents and the substantial one-off royalty income from BioVeris of
63million Swiss francs in the comparative period. On the other side, out-licensing income in 2005 was 116 million
Swiss francs, mainly from contracts with companies such as Applera, Abbott and GenProbe for Molecular
Diagnostics. This compensated for the decline in royalty income.
Cost of sales: The overall increase of 8% in local currencies was more than sales growth as costs of goods sold
increased at a rate more than twice as high as sales. In addition to heavy selling price pressure, there were
production start-up costs for many new products and also for the new Molecular Diagnostics manufacturing
facility in Branchburg in the US. Furthermore, production costs were higher for products with enhanced customer
features, there was higher depreciation from a higher volume of instrument placements and regulatory
compliance costs also increased. Royalty expenses of 237 million Swiss francs in 2005 were lower by 31 million
Swiss francs compared to 2004, due to the absence of royalties paid to Igen in 2005 (Igen was acquired by the
Group during 2004).
Finance Report 2005 11Roche Group
Financial Review
Marketing and distribution: The increase of 5% in local currencies was slightly above the increase in sales,
dueto the launch of a number of new Diabetes Care products such as the Accu-Chek Aviva blood glucose meter
in Europe and the US. Marketing and distribution as a percentage of sales remained stable at 26.0%.
Research and development: Costs grew by 2% in local currencies, less than sales, as some major projects such
as CoaguChek XS and Accu-Chek Aviva had their research and development cost peaks in 2004. As a percentage
of sales, research and development costs declined slightly by 0.3 percentage points to 8.7%.
General and administration: Costs decreased by 5% in local currencies due to strict cost control and lower SAP
implementation costs.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets: The increase is partially due to the amortisation of the
intangible assets acquired in the Igen acquisition. The 2005 results include a charge of 60 million Swiss francs
compared to 50 million Swiss francs in 2004 (representing 10 months since acquisition in March 2004).
Amortisation expenses for recently acquired licence and distribution rights account for the rest of the increase.
Corporate operating costs
General and administration: Costs declined to 125 million Swiss francs (336 million Swiss francs in 2004).
Included in the 2005 results is a gain of 127 million Swiss francs from the return of part of Chugai’s welfare
pension fund to the Japanese government in November 2005. The 2004 results included 44 million Swiss francs
of administration and other costs that were previously allocated to the Consumer Health (OTC) business. These
items were not transferred with the sale of the business and therefore they had been reclassified to the business
segment ‘Corporate’. In 2005 these costs were either restructured away or absorbed into the business segments
Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai.

Amortisation of goodwill: Following the changes in International Financial Reporting Standards the
amortisation of goodwill ceased effective 1 January 2005. No impairments to goodwill were recorded.
Major legal cases: During 2005 provisions for certain litigation and arbitration matters in the Pharmaceuticals
Division were increased by 210 million Swiss francs and in the Diagnostics Division by 146 million Swiss francs.
The provisions recorded are based on current litigation and settlement negotiations and recent settlement
agreements. Additional information is given in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Changes in Group organisation: There were no significant developments in 2005 and no additional income or
expenses were recorded.
Operating profit: The increase of 2,674 million Swiss francs or 44% in local currencies reflects the continued
improvement in the Group’s operating performance and lower exceptional items driven by the 2004 amortisation
of goodwill.

During 2005 the Group’s treasury operations delivered a positive net financial income, with net income from
financial assets and foreign exchange management exceeding financing costs by 296 million Swiss francs.
The Group’s effective tax rate was reduced by 3.5 percentage points to 24.8% from 28.3%, mainly due to the
discontinuation of amortisation of goodwill from 1 January 2005. Profit from continuing businesses increased due
to the combination of positive developments on the operating, financial and tax lines, which more than
compensated for the exceptional financial income in the 2004 results. Excluding this after-tax income of
582 million Swiss francs and the exceptional operating items, profit from continuing businesses increased by
2.1 billion Swiss francs or 43%. Net income was lower by 333 million Swiss francs at 6.7 billion Swiss francs,
duetothe inclusion of the 2.3 billion Swiss francs from the divested Consumer Health (OTC) business in 2004.

Financial income: Financial income showed further improvement compared to 2004. Net income from equity
securities was 258 million Swiss francs compared to 82 million Swiss francs in 2004, driven by strongly performing
equity markets during 2005, disposal of some equity investments and lower impairments of investments. Interest
income and income from debt securities more than doubled to 416 million Swiss francs due to higher holdings
and increases in interest rates. Net foreign exchange losses were 34 million Swiss francs compared to gains of
45 million Swiss francs in 2004. A full analysis of financial income is given in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Financing costs: Financing costs were 382 million Swiss francs, a reduction of 37%, mainly due to the retirement
of debt instruments and bank debt. Lower average levels of debt more than offset increasing interest rates on our
floating rate debt. A full analysis of financing costs is given in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Finance Report 2005 13Roche Group
Financial Review
Exceptional income from bond conversion and redemption: During 2004 as part of the continuing
refinancing and restructuring of the Group’s debt, the ‘LYONs IV’ and ‘LYONs III’ notes were called for redemption
and the Group also redeemed part of the ‘Chameleon’ bond by a public tender. Additionally in 2004, the Group
reassessed the likely future cash outflows for the ‘LYONs V’ notes and concluded it was appropriate to consider
the first call date of 25 July 2007 as the most probable date of cash flows. A net pre-tax gain of 872 million Swiss
francs arose from these transactions, primarily from the Group’s partial disposal of its interest in Genentech on
the conversion of the ‘LYONs IV’ notes.
Income taxes: The Group’s effective tax rate was 24.8% compared to the 2004 rate of 28.3%. The main influence
was the discontinuation of goodwill amortisation in the 2005 results, which reduced the rate by over 2 percentage
points. The underlying tax rate is broadly unchanged with the increasing relative contribution of Genentech and
Chugai to the Group’s overall results being largely offset by the use of research and development tax credits.
Areconciliation of the effective tax rate is given in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Profit from continuing businesses: The increase of 43% compared to 2004 is due to the positive developments
on the operating, financial and tax lines, which more than offset the exceptional financial income of 582 million
Swiss francs (after-tax) in the 2004 results. Excluding this and other exceptional items, profit from continuing
businesses increased by 2.1 billion Swiss francs or 43%.
Discontinued businesses: The 2005 results include the operating results for the remaining 2% of the OTC
(Consumer Health) business that was transferred to Bayer in 2005. The comparative results include the 2.1 billion
Swiss francs divestment gain from sale of the initial 98% of this business to Bayer as well as 0.2 billion Swiss
francs from the operating results of the whole OTC (Consumer Health) business, which was still fully owned by
the Roche Group until the end of 2004. Further information about discontinued businesses is given in Note 11 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net income: In 2005 Group net income decreased by 5% to 6.7 billion Swiss francs and the return on sales margin
was 19.0%. Net income attributable to the Roche shareholders was 12% lower than in the comparative period,
which includes 2.3 billion Swiss francs from the divested Consumer Health (OTC) business and the exceptional
financial income of 0.6 billion Swiss francs, after-tax. The share of net income attributable to minorities increased
by 106% to 943 million Swiss francs due to the continually improving profit contribution by Genentech and Chugai.
Within this, 616 million Swiss francs are attributable to Genentech minority interests and 318 million Swiss francs
to Chugai minority interests.

A full consolidated cash flow statement is given on page 25 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Operating cash flows: The Group’s business operations continued to show strong cash generation of 12.5 billion
Swiss francs, driven by continued growth in EBITDA. Tax payments were considerably higher than in 2004, mainly
due to the payment of tax on the gain on disposal of the Consumer Health (OTC) business and increased
payments at Genentech and Chugai. Overall operating cash flows increased by 36% to 10.0 billion Swiss francs.
Investing cash flows: The largest investing cash flow was the receipt from Bayer of 2.9 billion Swiss francs
proceeds from the divestment of the Consumer Health (OTC) business which was received on 1 January 2005.
Other investing cash flows include expenditure on property, plant and equipment of 3.3 billion Swiss francs, in
particular the 0.5 billion Swiss francs used by Genentech to purchase the Oceanside biologics manufacturing
facility. The increased net investment in marketable securities of 5.3 billion Swiss francs is mainly a result of the
strong cash generation of the operating business. In 2004 there was a large net cash inflow from sales of part of
the Group’s portfolio of marketable securities in order to fund the repayment of debt instruments.
Financing cash flows: Significant financing cash flows in 2005 and 2004 relate to dividend payments and the
redemption of debt instruments. Dividends paid in 2005 were 1.8 billion Swiss francs (2004: 1.5 billion Swiss
francs) and cash used for the redemption of debt instruments 1.2 billion Swiss francs (used for the ‘Sumo’ bonds)
compared to 3.0 billion Swiss francs in 2004 (used for the ‘LYONs III’ notes and ‘Chameleon’ bonds). The
redemption and conversion of the ‘LYONs IV’ notes in 2004 had a cash impact of only 5 million Swiss francs as
the debt obligation was almost entirely settled by the delivery of Genentech shares. In 2005 Genentech issued
2billion US dollars of Senior Notes. The resulting cash inflow was equivalent to 2.6 billion Swiss francs, although
Genentech used 0.7 billion Swiss francs of this to repay finance lease obligations. Genentech received 1.0 billion
Swiss francs from stock option exercises during 2005. In the same period, Genentech repurchased shares for
2.5billion Swiss francs.

plant and equipment and stock options exercises and repurchases at Genentech reduced net cash by a total of
4.7 billion Swiss francs. The payment of dividends reduced net cash by a further 1.8 billion Swiss francs. The
‘Sumo’ redemption, the issue of the Genentech Senior Notes and the repayment of finance leases at Genentech
reduce both debt and cash and therefore have no overall effect on net cash, although short-term debt was
reduced by 1.2 billion Swiss francs.

16 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Financial Review
Non-current assets: The increase in the US dollar to 1.31 against the Swiss franc at 31 December 2005 from 1.13
at 31 December 2004 increased long-term assets in Swiss franc terms since many of the Group’s production
facilities and intangible assets are denominated in US dollars. The purchase of the Oceanside biologics
manufacturing facility by Genentech increased property, plant and equipment by 0.5 billion Swiss francs and the
acquisition of GlycArt increased goodwill and intangible assets by 0.3 billion Swiss francs. Following the decision
of the California Supreme Court in February 2005 to review the litigation between Genentech and the City of Hope,
the surety bond of 1.0 billion Swiss francs that was posted by Genentech in 2002 has been reclassified from
current assets to long-term assets.
Current assets: Overall current assets increased due to the increase in liquid funds from the Group’s strong
operating performance, as well as the other matters described above in the section on cash flows and net cash.
The receipt of 2.9 billion Swiss francs from Bayer for the Consumer Health (OTC) business increased cash and
decreased other current assets.
Debt: The net effect of the issue of the Genentech Senior Notes and the repayment of finance leases at
Genentech increased debt by 1.9 billion Swiss francs. The redemption of the ‘Sumo’ bonds reduced debt by
1.2billion Swiss francs. Additionally the movement in US dollar exchange rates increased the Swiss franc carrying
value of the Group’s US dollar-denominated debt instruments.
Other non-current and current liabilities: The provision of 0.9 billion Swiss francs made by Genentech for the
City of Hope litigation has been reclassified from current liabilities to non-current liabilities.
Total net assets/equity: The most significant movements were the net income of 6.7 billion Swiss francs,
the dividend payments of 1.8 billion Swiss francs and currency translation gains of 2.5 billion Swiss francs.
The currency translation gains mainly arose from the increase in the US dollar relative to the Swiss franc,
which particularly affects the balance sheet values of assets and liabilities that have particular concentrations
inthe US, such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets and debt.
Strong financial condition: The Group remains solidly financed, with equity (including minority interests)
representing 60% of total assets and 86% of total assets financed long-term.
Roche securities
Price development
The Roche securities performed significantly better than both the Swiss market and a peer group of 20 healthcare
companies1). The Roche share price closed the year 2005 at 219.20 Swiss francs compared to a price of
150.00Swiss francs at the end of 2004 (+46%), and the Roche non-voting equity security (Genussschein) closed
the year 2005 at 197.30 Swiss francs compared to a price of 130.90 Swiss francs at the end of the previous year
(+51%). In comparison the SMI gained 33.2%. The market capitalisation of Roche was 171 billion Swiss francs at
the end of 2005, compared to 113 billion Swiss francs at the end of 2004.
Roche was among the leaders in its peer group in 2005 in terms of total shareholder return (TSR), i.e. share price
growth plus dividends. Year-end return was 48% for the Roche share and 53% for the Roche non-voting equity
security. The combined performance of share and non-voting equity security was 52% compared to a weighted
average return for the peer group of 25%.

Dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing a 25% increase in the dividend for 2005 to 2.50 Swiss francs per share and
non-voting equity security (2004: 2.00 Swiss francs) for approval at the Annual General Meeting. This is the 19th
consecutive increase in the dividend. If the dividend proposal is approved by shareholders, dividend payments on
the shares and non-voting equity securities in issue will amount to 2.2 billion Swiss francs (2004: 1.7 billion Swiss
francs), resulting in a payout ratio of 37% (2004: 26%). Based on the prices at year-end 2005, the dividend yield
on the Roche share is 1.1% (2004: 1.3%) and the yield on the non-voting equity security is 1.3% (2004: 1.5%).

Financial risks
Value-at-Risk and Earnings-at-Risk analysis tools
The Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculations are used to indicate within what ranges the value of the respective assets
or liabilities may fluctuate with a certain probability over a certain time period (holding period). The VaR measure
is a statistical measure, implicitly assuming that the value changes of the recent past are indicative of value
changes in the future. Market shocks are not included in this calculation, unless recently observed. The Group
conducts additional stress testing to take such possibilities into consideration. The Group uses statistically
relevant observation periods and applies holding periods, which reflect the time period required to change the
respective risk exposure if deemed appropriate. With longer holding periods, the probability of higher value
changes increases and so does the VaR measure.
18 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Financial Review
Earnings-at-Risk (EaR) is equivalent to the VaR methodology, but rather than potential value changes, it indicates
the potential changes to profits (losses) with a certain probability and over a certain time period. The same
constraints and limitations apply to this methodology.
During 2005 the VaR and EaR methodology has been further refined. The holding period has been set as
20trading days and an enhanced calculation model has been introduced. All VaR and EaR figures for interest rate
risks are measured using a historical simulation approach, while in 2004 the delta-normal approach was used.
For each historical scenario (representing all price and rate changes of all individual instruments over a specific
20-day period in the past 10 years), all financial instruments are fully revalued (using valuation models) and
the total change in value and earnings is determined. All VaR and EaR calculations below are based on 95%
confidence level and a holding period of 20 trading days. Comparative information for 2004 has been restated.
The Group cannot predict future market movements. The VaR and EaR figures given below do not represent the
actual losses which are expected or might be incurred on financial assets and liabilities, nor the possible worst
loss over the period stated, nor do they consider the effect of favourable changes in market rates.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s exposure to movements in foreign currencies affecting its net income and financial position,
asexpressed in Swiss francs, is summarised by the following key figures and comments.

On average in 2005, all major currencies remained stable against the Swiss franc. Consequently there is almost
no difference between sales growth of the continuing businesses and operating profit growth expressed in Swiss
francs or in local currencies. In absolute terms, the sensitivity of Group sales of continuing businesses to a change
of the US dollar against the Swiss franc by 0.01 Swiss francs during 2005 was approximately 105 million Swiss
francs, and the corresponding sensitivities for the euro and yen were approximately 60 million Swiss francs and
35 million Swiss francs respectively.
In 2005, the Group further pursued a strategy to continuously lock-in favourable developments of foreign
exchange rates by entering into derivative contracts, thereby reducing the exposure to potential future
movements in foreign exchange rates. The foreign exchange transaction VaR remained at a low level during 2005.

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could have adverse effects on the Group’s
netincome or financial position. Changes in interest rates cause variations in interest income and expenses on
interest-bearing assets and liabilities. In addition, they can affect the market value of certain financial assets,
liabilities and instruments. Where appropriate, the Group uses financial derivatives such as swaps to manage its
interest rate risk.
In 2005 Genentech issued new bonds of 2 billion US dollars. Despite that, the Group’s debt only increased
by0.6billion CHF due to the redemption of other outstanding debt such as bank debt, capitalised leases and the
‘Sumo’ bond. In order to achieve a better match between the term structure of assets and liabilities, the Group
has further swapped a sizeable part of the remaining debt into floating interest rates. As a consequence, the
exposure to potential changes of interest rates has decreased and interest rate VaR, measuring the potential
change of the net market value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, has declined. The interest rate VaR
only considers Roche’s interest rate sensitive position.
The comparatively small risks from re-pricing or re-financing were contained at reasonable levels. However
Earnings-at-risk (EaR) has increased mainly as a result of more liquid funds held with short interest rate
commitments and because of the generally higher interest rate levels, which allow more room for downward
changes of interest rates.

Market risk of financial assets and liabilities
Changes in the market value of financial assets and liabilities can affect the net income or financial position of
the Group. Market risk arises from movements in stock prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates.
The Group’s financial assets are mostly held in highly liquid fixed income and money market instruments. During
2005 the currency allocation and maturity profile between financial assets and financial liabilities was further
aligned. The equity allocation in the Group’s portfolio of cash and marketable securities has been further reduced
to around 0.8 billion Swiss francs (4% of total cash and marketable securities), down from the 1.2 billion Swiss
francs at 31 December 2004 (10% of total cash and marketable securities).
International Financial Reporting Standards
The Roche Group has been using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to report its consolidated
results since 1990. Since late 2003 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has published a number
of new and revised standards that first became effective in 2005, which the Group implemented from 1 January
2005. These are fully discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill amortisation: Effective 1 January 2005 the amortisation of goodwill has ceased, although goodwill will
continue to be tested for impairment. This change requires prospective application. Had the standard been
applied in 2004, then goodwill amortisation expenses of 572 million Swiss francs (continuing businesses) would
not have been recorded in the 2004 operating results and net income attributable to Roche shareholders would
have been 456 million Swiss francs higher.
Share-based payment: The fair value of equity compensation plans awarded to employees is estimated at grant
date and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. This change requires retrospective application, using
certain transitional requirements. Applying the transitional requirements, the impact on the previously reported
operating income and net income attributable to Roche shareholders for 2004 is 149 million Swiss francs and
71 million Swiss francs respectively. Due to the transitional requirements these are not indicative of the future
impacts.
20 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Financial Review
Recognition of intangible assets: The revised standards on intangible assets and business combinations will
typically result in more intangible assets being recognised from acquisitions, in-licensing collaborations and
alliances than previously. During 2005 approximately 198 million Swiss francs, which previously would have been
expensed as research and development expenses, was capitalised as intangible assets. The standards require
prospective application.
Financial instruments: The Group had already fully applied the previous IAS 39 on ‘Financial Instruments’ since
2001. The additional changes implemented in 2005 to the standards on financial instruments, which require
retrospective application, do not have a significant effect.
Equity and minority interests: Minority interests is now included as part of the Group’s equity and not as a
separate category on the balance sheet. This increases the Group’s equity by 5,070 million Swiss francs, applied
retrospectively to 1 January 2004.
Presentation of income statement: Following the above changes the Group has revised the presentation of the
income statement, which now includes a full divisional split of the Group’s operating results. These changes were
made in accordance with the requirements of the new and revised standards and in order to further improve
comparability of results to other healthcare companies and to allow readers to make a more accurate assessment
of the sustainable earnings capacity of the Group. The comparative results in the Consolidated Financial
Statements have been restated into the new format.
Full details of the changes are given in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Supplementary
presentation materials from the investor update held on 8 March 2005 are available on the ‘Investor Relations’
section of the Group’s website at www.roche.com.

Finance Report 2005 27Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Reference numbers indicate corresponding Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of the Roche Group have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and its interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards
Board (IASB) and comply with Swiss law. They have been prepared using the historical cost convention except
that, as disclosed in the accounting policies below, certain items, including derivatives and available-for-sale
investments, are shown at fair value. They were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 26 January 2006
and are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on 27 February 2006.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure
ofcontingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. If in the future such estimates and assumptions,
which are based on management’s best judgement at the date of the financial statements, deviate from the actual
circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the year in which the
circumstances change.
Changes in accounting policies that arise from the application of new or revised standards and interpretations
are applied retrospectively, unless otherwise specified in the transitional requirements of the particular standard
or interpretation. Retrospective application requires that the results of the comparative period and the opening
balances of that period are restated as if the new accounting policy had always been applied. In addition
comparatives have been reclassified or extended from the previously reported results to take into account
presentational changes.
Consolidation policy
These financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, a company registered
in Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’).
The subsidiaries are those companies controlled, directly or indirectly, by Roche Holding Ltd, where control is
defined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from
its activities. This control is normally evidenced when Roche Holding Ltd owns, either directly or indirectly, more
than 50% of the voting rights or potential voting rights of a company’s share capital. Special Purpose Entities are
consolidated where the substance of the relationship is that the Special Purpose Entity is controlled by the Group.
Companies acquired during the year are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group,
and subsidiaries to be divested are included up to the date on which control passes from the Group. Inter-
company balances, transactions and resulting unrealised income are eliminated in full.
Investments in associated companies are accounted for by the equity method. These are companies over which
the Group exercises, or has the power to exercise, significant influence, but which it does not control. This is
normally evidenced when the Group owns 20% or more of the voting rights or potential voting rights of the
company. Balances and transactions with associated companies that result in unrealised income are eliminated
to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associated company. Interests in joint ventures are reported using the
line-by-line proportionate consolidation method.
Segment reporting
The Group’s primary format for segment reporting is business segments and the secondary format is geographical
segments. The risks and returns of the Group’s operations are primarily determined by the different products that
the Group produces rather than the geographical location of the Group’s operations. This is reflected by the
Group’s management and organisational structure and internal financial reporting systems.
28 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The determination of the Group’s business and geographic segments is based on the organisation units for
which information is reported to the Group’s management. The Group has two divisions, Pharmaceuticals
and Diagnostics. Within the Pharmaceuticals Division there are three sub-divisions, Roche Pharmaceuticals,
Genentech and Chugai. The three sub-divisions have separate management and reporting structures within the
Pharmaceuticals Division and are considered separately reportable business segments. The Vitamins and Fine
Chemicals business and the Consumer Health (OTC) business were previously separately reportable business
segments. These have been divested and are presented as discontinued businesses. Certain headquarter
activities are reported as ‘Corporate’. These consist of corporate headquarters, including the corporate executive
committee, corporate communications, corporate human resources, corporate finance, including treasury,
taxes and pension fund management and corporate legal and safety and environmental services. The Group’s
geographical segments are determined by geographical location and similarity of economic environments.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm’s length basis. Divisional assets and liabilities
consist of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade receivables/payables and
inventories. Other segment assets and liabilities consist of other assets and liabilities which can be reasonably
attributed to the reported business segments. These include pension assets/liabilities and provisions. Non-
segment assets and liabilities mainly include current and deferred income tax balances, and financial assets and
liabilities. These are principally cash, marketable securities, other investments and debt. Capital expenditure
comprises additions to goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, including those arising from
acquisitions.
Foreign currency translation
Most Group companies use their local currency as their functional currency. Certain Group companies use other
currencies (namely US dollars, Swiss francs or euros) as their functional currency where this is the currency of
the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Local transactions in other currencies are initially
reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses from the settlement of such
transactions and gains and losses on translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other
currencies are included in income, except when they are qualifying cash flow hedges or arise on monetary items
that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign entity, which are deferred into equity.
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using functional currencies other than Swiss francs
(foreign entities) are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange. Sales, costs, expenses,
net income and cash flows are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Translation differences
due to the changes in exchange rates between the beginning and the end of the year and the difference between
net income translated at the average and year-end exchange rates are taken directly to equity. On disposal of
a foreign entity, the identified cumulative currency translation differences within equity relating to that foreign
entity are recognised in income as part of the gain or loss on divestment.
Revenues and cost of sales
Sales represent amounts received and receivable for goods supplied to customers after deducting trade
discounts, cash discounts and volume rebates and excluding sales and value added taxes. Revenues from the
sale of products are recognised upon transfer to the customer of significant risks and rewards, usually upon
shipment. Trade discounts, cash discounts and volume rebates are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with
the recognition of the related sales. Estimates of expected sales returns, charge-backs and other rebates,
including Medicaid in the United States and similar rebates in other countries, are also deducted from sales and
recorded as accrued liabilities or provisions. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual or
legislatively-mandated obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience. Other revenues are recorded as
earned or as the services are performed. Where necessary, single transactions are split into separately identifiable
components to reflect the substance of the transaction. Conversely, two or more transactions may be considered
together for revenue recognition purposes, where the commercial effect cannot be understood without reference
to the series of transactions as a whole. Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and
related production overhead of goods sold and services rendered. Start-up costs between validation and the
achievement of normal production capacity are expensed as incurred.
Finance Report 2005 29Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Royalty income and expenses
Royalty income and expenses are recognised on an accrual basis. Royalty expenses directly linked to goods sold
are included in ‘Cost of sales’. Other royalty expenses are included in ‘General and administration’.
Research and development
In addition to its internal research and development activities, the Group is also party to in-licensing and similar
arrangements with its alliance partners. Furthermore the Group may acquire in-process research and
development assets, either through business combinations or through purchases of specific assets.
Internal research costs are charged against income as incurred. Internal development costs are capitalised as
intangible assets only when there is an identifiable asset that will generate expected future economic benefits
and when the cost of such an asset can be measured reliably. The Group does not currently have any such internal
development costs that qualify for capitalisation as intangible assets. Other internal development costs are
charged against income as incurred since the criteria for their recognition as an asset are not met.
In-process research and development assets acquired either through in-licensing arrangements, business
combinations or separate purchases are capitalised as intangible assets as described below. Once available for
use, such intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the expected benefit, and are
reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Licensing, milestone and other up-front receipts and payments
Certain Group companies receive from third parties up-front, milestone and other similar non-refundable
payments relating to the sale or licensing of products or technology. Revenue associated with performance
milestones is recognised based on achievement of the deliverables as defined in the respective agreements. Non-
refundable up-front payments and licence fees are initially reported as deferred income and are recognised as
revenue in income as earned over the period of the development collaboration or the manufacturing obligation.
Payments made by Group companies to third parties and associated companies for such items are capitalised as
intangible assets.
Receipts and payments between consolidated subsidiaries, such as between Genentech, Chugai and other Roche
Group subsidiaries, are eliminated on consolidation.
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding taxes payable
on the distribution of retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based on income, such as property and
capital taxes, are included within general and administration expenses.
Liabilities for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings,
principally relating to subsidiaries, are only recognised where there is a probable intention to remit such earnings.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred income tax assets relating
to the carry-forward of unused tax losses are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit
will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
Current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the same
taxation authority and when there is a legally enforceable right to offset them. Deferred income taxes are
determined based on the currently enacted tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction where the Group operates.
Discontinued businesses and non-current assets held for sale
A discontinued business is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business
or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Reclassification
as a discontinued business occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held
for sale, if earlier.
30 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
A disposal group is a group of assets that are to be disposed of as a group in a single transaction, together with
the liabilities directly associated with those assets that will be transferred in the transaction. The assets and
liabilities in a disposal group are reclassified as held-for-sale if their value will be recovered principally through
a sale rather than through continuing use. The disposal group must be available for sale in its current condition
and the sale must be highly probable.
Immediately before classification as held-for-sale, the measurement of all assets and liabilities in a disposal
groupis brought up-to-date in accordance with applicable accounting policies. Then, on initial reclassification as
held-for-sale, disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale are included in the income statement.
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary
benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group. Where
the Group provides long-term employee benefits, the cost is accrued to match the rendering of the services by
the employees concerned. Liabilities for long-term employee benefits are discounted to take into account the time
value of money, where material.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Most employees are covered by defined benefit and defined contribution post-employment plans sponsored by
Group companies. The accounting and reporting of defined benefit plans are based on recent actuarial valuations.
The defined benefit obligations and service costs are calculated using the projected unit credit method. This
reflects service rendered by employees to the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily
regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of benefits, projected rates of remuneration
growth, and long-term expected rates of return for plan assets. Discount rates are based on the market yields of
high-quality corporate bonds in the country concerned. Differences between assumptions and actual experiences
and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions are allocated over the estimated average remaining working
lives of employees, where these differences exceed a defined corridor. Past service costs are allocated over
the average period until the benefits become vested. Expenses from defined benefit plans are charged to
theappropriate income statement heading within the operating results. Pension plan administration and funding
is overseen at a corporate level and any settlement gains and losses resulting from changes in funding
arrangements are reported as general and administration expenses within the Corporate business segment.
Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless the Group has a legally
enforceable right to use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan. The recognition of pension
assets is limited to the net total of any unrecognised actuarial losses and past service costs and the present value
of any future refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans. The Group’s contributions
to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the year to which they relate.
Equity compensation plans
Certain employees of the Group participate in equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Genentech
and Chugai. The fair value of all equity compensation awards granted to employees is estimated at the grant date
and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. The expense is charged to the appropriate income statement
heading within the operating results. For equity-settled plans, an increase in equity is recorded and any
subsequent cash flows from exercises of vested awards are recorded as an increase in equity. For cash-settled
plans, a liability is recorded, which is measured at fair value at each balance sheet date with any movements
in fair value being recorded to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results. Any
subsequent cash flows from exercises of vested awards are recorded as a reduction of the liability.
Finance Report 2005 31Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction and are depreciated on
a straight-line basis, except for land, which is not depreciated. Estimated useful lives of major classes of
depreciable assets are as follows:
Land improvements 40 years
Buildings 10–50 years
Machinery and equipment 5–15 years
Diagnostic instruments 3–5 years
Office equipment 3 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for
as separate items. The estimated useful life of the assets is regularly reviewed and, if necessary, the future
depreciation charge is accelerated. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Borrowing costs
are not capitalised.
Leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all of the risks and rewards of
ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the start of the lease at fair value,
or the present value of the minimum lease payments, if lower. The rental obligation, net of finance charges,
is reported within debt. Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated in accordance with the Group’s
above policy on property, plant and equipment. The interest element of the lease payment is charged against
income over the lease term based on the effective interest rate method.
Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group are classified
as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged against income on a straight-line basis
over the period of the lease.
Where the Group is the lessor, assets subject to finance leases are reported as receivables at an amount equal
to the net investment in the lease. Assets subject to operating leases are reported within property, plant and
equipment. Lease income from finance leases is recognised over the term of the lease based on the effective
interest rate method. Lease income from operating leases is recognised over the lease term on a straight-line
basis.
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The cost of acquisition is
the consideration given in exchange for control over the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities
ofthe acquired company. This consideration includes the cash paid plus the fair value at the date of exchange of
assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group. The cost of acquisition
also includes directly attributable costs. The acquired net assets, being the identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities, are initially recognised at fair value. Where the Group does not acquire 100% ownership of
the acquired company, minority interest is recorded as the minority’s proportion of the fair value of the acquired
net assets. Goodwill is recorded as the surplus of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value
of the acquired net assets. Any goodwill and fair value adjustments are recorded as assets and liabilities of the
acquired company and are recorded in the local currency of that company. Goodwill is not amortised, but is
assessed for possible impairment at each balance sheet date and is additionally tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill may also arise upon investments in associated companies, being the surplus of the cost of investment
over the Group’s share of the fair value of the net identifiable assets. Such goodwill is recorded within investments
in associated companies.
32 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Intangible assets
Patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Where these assets have
been acquired through a business combination, this will be the fair value allocated in the acquisition accounting.
Where these have been acquired other than through a business combination, the initial fair value will be cost.
Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis beginning from the point when they
are available for use. Estimated useful life is the lower of the legal duration or the economic useful life. The
estimated useful life of intangible assets is regularly reviewed. Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets
is presented separately in the income statement due to the materiality of the amounts and in order to fairly present
the Group’s results.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
When there is evidence that an asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is calculated and
animpairment assessment is carried out. When the recoverable amount of an asset, being the higher of its fair
value less costs to sell and its value in use, is less than its carrying amount, then the carrying amount is reduced
to its recoverable value. This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. Value in
use is calculated using estimated cash flows, generally over a five-year period, with extrapolating projections
for subsequent years. These are discounted using an appropriate long-term pre-tax interest rate. When
an impairment loss arises, the useful life of the asset in question is reviewed and, if necessary, the future
depreciation/amortisation charge is accelerated. The impairment of financial assets is discussed below in the
‘financial assets’ policy.
Impairment of goodwill
An impairment assessment of goodwill is carried out annually. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units,
which are the Group’s business segments. When the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, being the
higher of its fair value less costs to sell or its value in use, is less than its carrying amount, then an impairment in
the carrying amount is recorded. The methodology used in the impairment testing for cash-generating units is
further described in Note 16.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. The cost of finished goods and work in process
includes raw materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs and overheads based upon normal
capacity of production facilities. Borrowing costs are not included. Cost is determined using the weighted average
method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to completion and selling expenses.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts.
An allowance is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount where
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. Long-term accounts
receivable are discounted to take into account the time value of money, where material. Provisions for sales
returns and sales charge-backs are reported as provisions and accrued liabilities, respectively.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand and time, call and current balances with banks and similar
institutions. Such balances are only reported as cash if they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash,
are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value, and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of
acquisition. This definition is also used for the cash flow statement.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to
an outflow of resources that can be reasonably estimated. In particular, restructuring provisions are recognised
when the Group has a detailed formal plan that has either commenced implementation or been announced.
Provisions are recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise, taking into account foreign
currency effects arising from their translation from their functional currency into Swiss francs and the time value
of money, where material. A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be
confirmed by future events, or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.
Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Finance Report 2005 33Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Fair values
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between
knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by reference to quoted market
prices or by the use of established estimation techniques such as option pricing models and estimated
discounted values of cash flows. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are
approximately in line with their reported carrying values unless specifically mentioned in the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Financial assets
Financial assets, principally investments, including marketable securities, are classified as either ‘Fair-value-
through-profit-or-loss’, ‘Available-for-sale’, ‘Held-to-maturity’ or ‘Loans and receivables’. Fair-value-through-
profit-or-loss financial assets are either classified as held-for-trading, or designated upon initial recognition.
Held-for-trading financial assets are acquired principally to generate profit from short-term fluctuations in price.
Financial assets are designated as fair-value-through-profit-or-loss if doing so results in more relevant
information by eliminating a measurement or recognition inconsistency. Held-to-maturity financial assets are
securities with a fixed maturity that the Group has the intent and ability to hold until maturity. Loans and
receivables are loans and other long-term financial assets created by the Group or acquired from the issuer in a
primary market. They are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments. All other financial
assets are considered to be available-for-sale.
All financial assets are initially recorded at fair value, including transaction costs, except for assets designated as
fair-value-through-profit-or-loss, which exclude transaction costs. All purchases and sales are recognised on the
settlement date. Fair-value-through-profit-or-loss financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value, with all
changes in fair value recorded as financial income in the period in which they arise. Held-to-maturity financial
assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Available-for-sale
financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value, with all unrealised changes in fair value recorded in equity.
When the available-for-sale financial assets are sold, impaired or otherwise disposed of, the cumulative gains
and losses previously recognised in equity are included in financial income for the current period. Loans and
receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost.
Financial assets are assessed for possible impairment at each balance sheet date. An impairment charge is
recorded where there is objective evidence of impairment, such as where the issuer is in bankruptcy, default or
other significant financial difficulty. Any available-for-sale financial assets that have a market value of more than
25% below their original cost, net of any previous impairment, will be considered as impaired. Any available-for-
sale financial assets that have a market value below their original cost, net of any previous impairment, for a
sustained six-month period will be considered as impaired. Any decreases in the market price of less than 25%
of original cost, net of any previous impairment, which are also for less than a sustained six-month period are not
by themselves considered as objective evidence of impairment. Such movements in fair value are recorded in
equity until there is objective evidence of impairment or until the asset is sold or otherwise disposed of. For
financial assets carried at amortised cost, any impairment charge is the difference between the carrying value
and the recoverable amount, calculated using estimated future cash flows discounted using the original effective
interest rate. For available-for-sale financial assets, any impairment charge is the amount currently carried in
equity for the difference between the original cost, net of any previous impairment, and the fair value.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows of the assets expire or when the
Group sells or otherwise disposes of the contractual rights to the cash flows, including situations where the Group
retains the contractual rights but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to a third party.
Derivatives
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Apart from those
derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments (see below), all changes in fair value are
recorded as financial income in the period in which they arise. Embedded derivatives are recognised separately
if not closely related to the host contract and where the host contract is carried at amortised cost.
34 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Hedging
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types. Fair value hedges are hedges
of particular risks that may change the fair value of a recognised asset or liability. Cash flow hedges are hedges
of particular risks that may change the amount or timing of future cash flows. Hedges of net investment in a
foreign entity are hedges of particular risks that may change the carrying value of the net assets of a foreign entity.
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation,
probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. If these conditions are not met,
then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged
item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship. In particular any derivatives are
reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial income.
For qualifying fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item is recorded
at its previous carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair value that are attributable to the hedged risk. Any
changes in the fair values are reported in financial income.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of any change
infairvalue that is an effective hedge is included in equity, and any remaining ineffective portion is reported in
financial income. If the hedging relationship is the hedge of a firm commitment or highly probable forecasted
transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the cumulative changes of fair value
of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in the initial carrying value of the asset
or liability at the date of recognition. For all other qualifying cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes of fair
value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in financial income when the
forecasted transaction affects net income.
For qualifying hedges of net investment in a foreign entity, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The
portion of any change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity. Any remaining ineffective
portion is recorded in financial income where the hedging instrument is a derivative and in equity in other cases.
If the entity is disposed of, then the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been
recorded in equity are reclassified to income.
Debt instruments
Debt instruments are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Subsequently they are reported at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Any discount between the
net proceeds received and the principal value due on redemption is amortised over the duration of the debt
instrument and is recognised as part of financing costs using the effective interest rate method. Certain debt
instruments may be designated as ‘fair-value-through-profit-or-loss’ where doing so results in more relevant
information as it eliminates or significantly reduces measurement or recognition inconsistencies. This would
previously have occurred for those instruments that were subject to qualifying fair value hedges. Such debt
instruments are reported at fair value, based on quoted prices in an active market, with movements in fair value
reported within financial income. Those debt instruments that are designated as fair-value-through-profit-or-loss
are disclosed in Note 30.
A bifurcation is carried out upon the issue of convertible debt instruments. The initial carrying value of the liability
element is calculated using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible instrument. The remainder
of the net proceeds is allocated to the equity conversion option, which is reported in equity, and to deferred
income tax liabilities. The liability element is subsequently reported at amortised cost, or fair-value-through-
profit-and-loss if so designated.
Finance Report 2005 35Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The original cost of
acquisition, consideration received for subsequent resale of these equity instruments and other movements are
reported as changes in equity. These instruments have been acquired primarily to meet the obligations that may
arise in respect of certain of the Group’s debt instruments.
Management judgements made in applying accounting policies
The application of the Group’s accounting policies may require management to make judgements, apart from
those involving estimates, that can have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated
financial statements. Management judgement is particularly required when assessing the substance of
transactions that have a complicated structure or legal form. These include, but are not limited to, the following
areas:
Revenue recognition: The nature of the Group’s business is such that many sales transactions do not have a
simple structure. Sales agreements may consist of multiple components occurring at different times. The Group
is also party to various out-licensing agreements, which can involve upfront and milestone payments that
may occur over several years. These agreements may also involve certain future obligations. Revenue is only
recognised when, in management’s judgement, the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been
transferred and when the Group does not retain continuing managerial involvement or effective control over the
goods sold or when the obligation has been fulfilled. For some transactions this can result in cash receipts being
initially recognised as deferred income and then released to income over subsequent periods on the basis of the
performance of the conditions specified in the agreement.
Leases: The Group is party to leasing arrangements, both as a lessor and as a lessee. The treatment of leasing
transactions in the financial statements is mainly determined by whether the lease is considered to be an
operating lease or a finance lease. In making this assessment, management looks at the substance of the lease,
as well as the legal form, and makes a judgement about whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of
ownership are transferred.
Key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
income, expenses and related disclosures. The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical
experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in accounting estimates
may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based, or as a result of
new information or more experience. Such changes are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.
The key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of
causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next twelve months are
described below.
36 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Revenue recognition: The Group has accruals and provisions for expected sales returns, charge-backs and
other rebates, including Medicaid in the United States and similar rebates in other countries, which at
31December 2005 total 381 million Swiss francs. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual
or legislatively-mandated obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience. Management believes that
the total accruals and provisions for these items are adequate, based upon currently available information. As
these deductions are based on management estimates, they may be subject to change as better information
becomes available. Such changes that arise could impact the accruals and provisions recognised in the balance
sheet in future periods and consequently the level of sales recognised in the income statement in future periods.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill: The Group has property, plant
and equipment with a carrying value of 15,097 million Swiss francs as disclosed in Note 15. Goodwill has
a carrying value of 6,132 million Swiss francs (see Note 16) and intangible assets have a carrying value of
6,256 million Swiss francs (see Note 17). All of these assets are reviewed annually for impairment as described
above. To assess if any impairment exists, estimates are made of the future cash flows expected to result from the
use of the asset and its eventual disposal. Actual outcomes could vary significantly from such estimates of
discounted future cash flows. Factors such as changes in the planned use of buildings, machinery or equipment,
or closure of facilities, the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence or lower than anticipated
sales for products with capitalised rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits: Many of the Group’s employees participate in post-
employment defined benefit plans. The calculations of the recognised assets and liabilities from such plans are
based upon statistical and actuarial calculations. In particular the present value of the defined benefit obligation
is impacted by assumptions on discount rates used to arrive at the present value of future pension liabilities, and
assumptions on future increases in salaries and benefits. Furthermore, the Group’s independent actuaries use
statistically based assumptions covering areas such as future withdrawals of participants from the plan and
estimates on life expectancy. At 31 December 2005 the present value of the Group’s defined benefit obligation is
10,978 million Swiss francs for funded plans and 3,630 million Swiss francs for unfunded plans (see Note 13). The
actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changes in market and economic
conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants and other changes in
the factors being assessed. These differences could impact the assets or liabilities recognised in the balance
sheet in future periods.
Legal provisions: Group companies are party to various legal proceedings. The most significant matters are
described in Notes 7, 11 and 28, and legal provisions at 31 December 2005 total 1,366 million Swiss francs,
asdisclosed in Note 28. Additional claims could be made which might not be covered by existing provisions or by
insurance. There can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in the scope of these matters or that any
future lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations will not be material. Such changes that arise could impact
the provisions recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Environmental provisions: The Group has provisions for environmental remediation costs, which at
31 December 2005 total 212 million Swiss francs, as disclosed in Note 28. The material components of the
environmental provisions consist of costs to fully clean and refurbish contaminated sites and to treat and contain
contamination at certain other sites. Future remediation expenses are affected by a number of uncertainties that
include, but are not limited to, the detection of previously unknown contaminated sites, the method and extent
of remediation, the percentage of waste material attributable to the Group at the remediation sites relative to
that attributable to other parties, and the financial capabilities of the other potentially responsible parties.
Management believes that the total provisions for environmental matters are adequate based upon currently
available information. However, given the inherent difficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, it cannot be
guaranteed that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued. The effect of resolution of
environmental matters on results of operations cannot be predicted due to uncertainty concerning both the
amount and the timing of future expenditures and the results of future operations. Such changes that arise could
impact the provisions recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Finance Report 2005 37Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Income taxes: At 31 December 2005, the net liability for current income taxes is 512 million Swiss francs and the
net liability for deferred income taxes is 1,794 million Swiss francs, as disclosed in Note 10. Significant estimates
are required in determining the current and deferred assets and liabilities for income taxes. Some of these
estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Management believes that the
estimates are reasonable and that the recognised liabilities for income tax-related uncertainties are adequate.
Various internal and external factors may have favourable or unfavourable effects on the income tax assets and
liabilities. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing
interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, future levels of R&D spending, and changes in overall levels of
pre-tax earnings. Such changes that arise could impact the assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet
in future periods.
Changes in accounting policies
In late 2003 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) published a revised version of IAS 32 ‘Financial
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’, a revised version of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement’ and ‘Improvements to International Accounting Standards’, which makes changes to 14 existing
standards. In the first quarter of 2004 the IASB published IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’, IFRS 3 ‘Business
Combinations’, IFRS 4 ‘Insurance Contracts’, IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued
Operations’, revised versions of IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ and IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ and further
amendments to IAS 39. In mid-2005 the IASB issued a further revision to IAS 39 regarding the Fair Value Option.
The Group adopted these effective 1 January 2005. A description of these changes and their effect on the
consolidated financial statements is given below.
IAS 8: ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’. Amongst other matters,
the revised standard requires that changes in accounting policies that arise from the application of new or
revised standards and interpretations are applied retrospectively, unless otherwise specified in the transitional
requirements of the particular standard or interpretation. Previously the Group has applied all changes
prospectively, unless otherwise specified in the transitional requirements.
Retrospective application requires that the results of the comparative period and the opening balances of that period
be restated as if the new accounting policy had always been applied. Prospective application requires that the new
accounting policy only be applied to the results of the current period and the comparative period is not restated.
IFRS 2: ‘Share-based Payment’. Amongst other matters, the new standard requires that the fair value of all
equity compensation plan awards granted to employees be estimated at grant date and recorded as an expense
over the vesting period. The expense is charged against the appropriate income statement heading. Under the
Group’s previous policy no expenses were recorded for equity-settled equity compensation plans. Expenses for
cash-settled equity compensation plans were recorded based on the intrinsic value of the outstanding obligation
as part of ‘Other operating expenses’. The standard also requires retrospective application, within certain
transitional requirements. The transitional requirements require companies to apply the new standard with
retrospective effect for all awards made after 7 November 2002 which had not yet vested at 31 December 2004
and additionally for all cash-settled awards that had not been exercised at 31 December 2004. Applying the
transitional requirements, a pre-tax expense of 504 million Swiss francs has been recorded (293 million Swiss
francs in the restated 2004 results). Due to the impact of the transitional requirements these amounts are not
indicative of the future expenses for such plans. Expenses for cash-settled plans totalling 118 million Swiss francs
in 2004 were reclassified from ‘Other operating expenses’.

General and administration 51 35 86
Total operating expense 149 118 267
38 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
In addition to the above amounts, expenses totalling 26 million Swiss francs for Roche Connect and the Roche
Performance Share Plan had already been included in the 2004 operating results as originally published and
therefore did not need to be restated.
The new standard also affects the Group’s effective tax rate, as deferred tax is recorded based on the expected
tax benefits arising from vested awards. In the United States and many other tax jurisdictions the current equity
price is used as an input to the calculation. The impact on the income statement of any income tax benefit is
capped with reference to the IFRS 2 pre-tax expense, with any excess recognised directly in equity.
Further information on the Group’s equity compensation plans is given in Note 14.
IFRS 3: ‘Business Combinations’. Amongst other matters, the new standard requires that amortisation of
goodwill cease from the date of implementation. Goodwill will continue to be tested for impairment. The standard
requires prospective application. Had this standard been applied in 2004, then goodwill amortisation expenses of
572 million Swiss francs for continuing businesses and 7 million Swiss francs for discontinued businesses would
not have been recorded. No additional impairment would have been necessary. In addition, together with IAS 38
(revised) ‘Intangible Assets’, this standard will typically result in more intangible assets being recognised from
acquisitions than previously and consequently less goodwill will arise.
The new standard also affects the Group’s effective tax rate, as no tax benefit was recorded in respect of goodwill
amortisation. Based on the Group’s 2004 results, the Group’s effective tax rate is expected to decrease by between
two and three percentage points.
IAS 38 (revised): ‘Intangible Assets’. Amongst other matters, the revised standard will typically result in more
intangible assets being recognised from in-licensing arrangements and similar research and development
alliances. Previously such expenditure would be recorded as research and development expenses. The revised
standard requires prospective application.
IAS 32 (revised) and IAS 39 (revised): ‘Financial Instruments’. Since the Group already fully applied the
previous IAS 32 and IAS 39 on ‘Financial Instruments’ the revised standards did not have a significant effect on
the Group’s results and financial position. Amongst other matters, the revised standards require that a significant
orprolonged decline in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets be considered as objective evidence of
impairment. Under the Group’s previous accounting policy, a decline in fair value of available-for-sale financial
assets was considered as objective evidence of impairment where the decline was significant and prolonged.
Consequently, the revised standards will typically result in impairment charges being recognised for available-
for-sale financial assets at an earlier stage than under the previous accounting policy. Additionally, the Group has
adopted the further revision to IAS 39 regarding the Fair Value Option. Three of the Group’s debt instruments
(asspecified in Note 30) are now designated as ‘fair-value-through-profit-or-loss’. These were previously subject
to qualifying fair value hedges and the designation of these as fair-value-through-profit-or-loss results in more
relevant information as it eliminates or significantly reduces measurement or recognition inconsistencies. The
revised standards require retrospective application and this additionally results in a restatement of the equity
conversion elements of certain of the Group’s convertible debt instruments in 2004. As a result equity as at
1 January 2004 was reduced by 221 million Swiss francs and an additional pre-tax income of 35 million Swiss
francs has been recorded for the restated 2004 results.
IAS 1 (revised): ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’. Amongst other matters, the revised standard requires
the presentation of the results of discontinued businesses as a single amount on the face of the income
statement. Additionally the revised standard requires that minority interests are included as part of the Group’s
equity and not as a separate category on the balance sheet. In addition the revised standard permits the separate
presentation of a statement of recognised income and expense and a statement of transactions with equity
holders acting in their capacity as equity holders.
Finance Report 2005 39Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Presentation of income statement: The new and revised standards result in significant changes to the format
and content of the income statement. In addition the Group has made certain presentational changes to further
improve comparability of its results to those of other healthcare companies and to allow readers to make a more
accurate assessment of the sustainable earnings capacity of the Group. These changes, which have been applied
retrospectively, are listed below.
• ‘Royalties and other operating income’ are shown as a separate line after ‘Sales’.
• ‘Cost of sales’ includes royalty expenses that are directly linked to goods sold. In 2005 this was 1,531 million
Swiss francs (2004: 1,140 million Swiss francs).
• ‘Other operating expenses’ is removed from the income statement. ‘Administration’ is expanded to ‘General and
administration’ to additionally include ‘Other operating expenses’ other than those royalty expenses included in
‘Cost of sales’.
• ‘Financial income’ and ‘Financing costs’ are disclosed separately on the face of the income statement.
• Capital taxes are reported as part of ‘General and administration’ instead of ‘Financial income’ as previously. In
2005 this was 31 million Swiss francs (2004: 35 million Swiss francs) and has been included in the ‘Corporate’
business segment.

Presentation of the balance sheet: The balance sheet at 31 December 2004 has been restated following the
changes in IFRS that were adopted effective 1 January 2005. As a result of the implementation of IFRS 2,
net assets at 31 December 2004 were 75 million Swiss francs higher. This consists of inventories (40 million
Swiss francs asset), deferred tax assets (52 million Swiss francs asset) and liabilities for cash-settled equity
compensation plans (17 million Swiss francs liability). As a result of the implementation of IAS 32 (revised) and
IAS 39 (revised), net assets at 31 December 2004 were 85 million Swiss francs lower. This consists of long-term
debt (130 million Swiss francs liability) and deferred tax assets (45 million Swiss francs asset). In addition
provisions for sales returns and sales charge-backs are now classified as provisions and accrued liabilities,
respectively. Previously they were reported within accounts receivable. This reclassification was made to more
appropriately present these balances. In the 31 December 2004 balance sheet a total of 233 million Swiss francs
has been reclassified from ‘accounts receivable’ to ‘provisions-current’ (137 million Swiss francs) and ‘accrued
and other liabilities’ (96 million Swiss francs). There was no impact on net income or equity from this
reclassification.

Presentation of changes in equity: The new and revised standards result in significant changes to the format
and content of changes in equity. In particular, IAS 1 (revised) permits the separate presentation of a statement
of recognised income and expense and a statement of transactions with equity holders acting in their capacity as
equity holders. In addition the Group has made certain presentational changes in order to more fairly present the
Group’s financial position. These changes, which have been applied retrospectively, are listed below.
• As a result of the implementation of IAS 1 (revised) and IFRS 2, the net accounting effect of Genentech and
Chugai stock repurchases and stock options is recorded to equity and allocated to retained earnings and
minority interests based on the relevant ownership percentages. Previously these entries were recorded to
minority interests. These standards require retrospective application and accordingly 169 million Swiss francs
were reclassified from minority interests to retained earnings as at 1 January 2004.
• The equity element arising from the issue of convertible debt is now shown within retained earnings rather
than as a separate reserve. Accordingly 110 million Swiss francs were reclassified to retained earnings as at
1January 2004.

Finance Report 2005 41Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of the new and revised standards that will be effective from
1 January 2006. Effective 1 January 2006 the Group will apply IAS 19 (revised) ‘Employee Benefits’. Amongst other
matters, the revised standard allows actuarial gains and losses from defined benefit plans to be recorded directly
to equity. In this case adjustments arising from the limits on recognition of assets for defined benefit plans are
also to be recorded directly to equity. The revised standard requires retrospective application. The Group
estimates that in the restated 2005 results, profit before tax will be approximately 193 million Swiss francs higher,
net income for 2005 will be approximately 135 million Swiss francs higher, and equity as at 31 December 2005 will
be approximately 1.1 billion Swiss francs lower. The Group does not expect that the other new and revised
standards and interpretations will have a significant effect on the Group’s results and financial position, although
they will expand the disclosures in certain areas, notably IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ which the
Group will implement in 2007.
2. Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising from its underlying operations and corporate finance
activities. The Group’s financial risk exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange rates,
interest rates and equity prices as well as the creditworthiness and the solvency of the Group’s counter-parties.
The Group’s subsidiaries Genentech and Chugai have their own treasury operations. These have operational
independence, whilst working within a financial risk management framework that is consistent with the rest of
the Group. More information on their financial risks is available in the annual reports of Genentech and Chugai.
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies and guidelines approved by senior
management. These policies and guidelines cover foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk
and liquidity risk. Group policies and guidelines also cover areas such as cash management, investment of excess
funds and the raising of short- and long-term debt. Compliance with the policies and guidelines is managed by
segregated functions within the Group.
The objective of financial risk management is to contain, where deemed appropriate, exposures in the various
types of financial risks mentioned above in order to limit any negative impact on the Group’s results and financial
position.
The Group actively measures, monitors and manages its financial risk exposures by various functions pursuant to
segregation of duties principles.
In accordance with its financial risk policies, the Group manages its market risk exposures through the use of
financial instruments such as derivatives, when deemed appropriate. It is the Group’s policy and practice not to
enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes nor purposes unrelated to the underlying
business.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates across the world and is exposed to movements in foreign currencies affecting its net income
and financial position, as expressed in Swiss francs. The Group actively monitors its currency exposures, and
when appropriate, enters into transactions with the aim of preserving the value of assets, commitments and
anticipated transactions. The Group uses forward contracts, foreign exchange options and cross-currency swaps
to hedge certain committed and anticipated foreign exchange flows and financing transactions.
Transaction exposure arises because the amount of local currency paid or received for transactions
denominated in foreign currencies may vary due to changes in exchange rates. For many Group companies
revenues and operating expenses are primarily in the local currency. Similarly, transaction exposure arises on
net balances of monetary assets held in foreign currencies. At local level, the Group companies manage this
exposure, if necessary, by means of financial instruments such as options and forward contracts. In addition,
Group Treasury monitors total worldwide exposure on a monthly basis.
42 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Translation exposure arises from the consolidation of the foreign currency denominated financial statements of
the Group’s foreign subsidiaries. The effect on the Group’s consolidated equity is shown as a currency translation
movement. The Group partially hedges net investments in foreign currencies by taking out foreign currency loans
or issuing foreign currency denominated debt instruments. Major translation exposures are monitored regularly.
A significant part of the Group’s cash outflows for research, development, production and administration is
denominated in Swiss francs, while a much smaller proportion of the Group’s cash inflows are Swiss franc
denominated. As a result, an increase in the value of the Swiss franc relative to other currencies has an adverse
impact on consolidated net income. Similarly, a relative decrease in the value of the Swiss franc has a favourable
effect on results when reported in Swiss francs.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could have effects on the Group’s net income or
financial position. Changes in interest rates may cause variations in interest income and expenses resulting from
interest-bearing assets and liabilities. In addition, they can affect the market value of certain financial assets,
liabilities and instruments as described in the following section on market risk of financial assets. The interest
rates on the Group’s major debt instruments are fixed, as described in Note 30. The Group uses interest rate
derivatives to manage its interest rate risk.
Market risk of financial assets
Changes in the market value of certain financial assets and derivative instruments can affect the net income
or financial position of the Group. Financial long-term assets are held for strategic purposes and marketable
securities are held for fund management purposes. The risk of loss in value is managed by reviews prior to
investing and continuous monitoring of the performance of investments and changes in their risk profile.
Investments in equities, bonds, debentures and other fixed income instruments are entered into on the basis of
guidelines with regard to liquidity and credit rating.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counter-party to a transaction may be unable or unwilling to meet
their obligations causing a financial loss to the Group. Trade receivables are subject to a policy of active risk
management which focuses on the assessment of country risk, credit availability, ongoing credit evaluation and
account monitoring procedures. There are no significant concentrations within trade receivables of counter-party
credit risk due to the Group’s large number of customers and their wide geographical spread. For some credit
exposures in critical countries, the Group has obtained credit insurance. Country risk limits and exposures are
continuously monitored. The exposure of other financial assets to credit risk is controlled by setting a policy for
limiting credit exposure to high-quality counter-parties, regular reviews of credit ratings, and setting defined
limits for each individual counter-party. Where appropriate to reduce exposure, netting agreements under an
ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) master agreement are signed with the respective
counter-parties. The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering
netting agreements, is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets plus the positive fair value of derivative
instruments. The credit exposure is diversified amongst different counter-parties.
Liquidity risk
Group companies need sufficient availability of cash to meet their obligations. Individual companies are generally
responsible for their own cash management, including the short-term investment of cash surpluses and the
raising of loans to cover cash deficits, subject to guidance by the Group and, in certain cases, to approval at Group
level. The Group maintains sufficient reserves of cash and readily realisable marketable securities to meet its
liquidity requirements at all times. In addition, the strong international creditworthiness of the Group gives the
ability to efficiently use international capital markets for financing purposes. In 2005 a syndicated credit facility
of 2.5 billion euros was established with a term of seven years. This facility was not utilised during 2005.

4. Genentech
Effective 7 September 1990 the Group acquired a majority interest of approximately 60% of Genentech, Inc.,
a biotechnology company in the United States. On 13 June 1999 the Group exercised its option to acquire the
remaining shares of Genentech on 30 June 1999, at which point Genentech became a 100% owned subsidiary
of the Group. On 23 July 1999, 26 October 1999 and 29 March 2000 the Group completed public offerings of
Genentech’s common stock, which reduced the Group’s majority interest to 60%. Genentech issues additional
shares of common stock in connection with its equity compensation plans and also may issue additional shares
for other purposes, which affects the Group’s percentage ownership interest. The affiliation agreement between
the Group and Genentech provides, amongst other things, that Genentech establish a stock repurchase
programme to maintain the Group’s percentage ownership interest in Genentech.
46 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
During 2004 the Group’s ownership of Genentech decreased by 2.45% due to the conversion and redemption of
the ‘LYONs IV’ US dollar exchangeable notes, as described in Note 30. Changes in the Group’s ownership also
occurred due to stock repurchases by Genentech and the exercise of stock options by Genentech employees.
Effective 28 April 2004 Genentech implemented a two-for-one share split of Genentech’s common stock in the
form of a stock dividend, which had no impact on either the Group’s percentage ownership of Genentech or the
Group’s consolidated results. At 31 December 2005 the Group’s interest in Genentech was 55.7% (2004: 56.1%).
The common stock of Genentech is publicly traded and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the
symbol ‘DNA’. Genentech prepares financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (US GAAP). These are filed on a quarterly basis with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC).
Differences between IFRS and US GAAP
Due to certain consolidation entries and differences in the requirements of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and US GAAP, there are differences between Genentech’s stand-alone financial results on
a US GAAP basis and the financial results of Genentech as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance
withIFRS.

Translated at 1 USD = 1.25 CHF (2004: 1 USD = 1.24 CHF).
Effective 1 January 2005 the Group adopted IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ in its IFRS financial statements.
Amongst other matters, the new standard requires that the fair value of all equity compensation plans awarded
to employees be estimated at grant date and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. The expense is
charged against the appropriate income statement heading. The standard also requires retrospective application,
within certain transitional requirements. Applying the transitional requirements, a pre-tax expense of 235 million
US dollars or 293 million Swiss francs relating to plans at Genentech has been recorded in 2005 (2004 restated:
105 million US dollars or 131 million Swiss francs). Due to the impact of the transitional requirements these
amounts are not indicative of the future expenses for such plans.
Finance Report 2005 47Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
In Genentech’s US GAAP financial statements currently no expenses are recorded for these plans. Genentech will
adopt US Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R – ‘Share-Based Payment’ (FAS 123R) effective
1 January 2006. Amongst other matters, this will require that companies reporting under US GAAP recognise
compensation expenses for such plans. Due to the different dates of first application, measurement requirements
and transitional arrangements of FAS 123R and IFRS 2, the expenses recorded by Genentech in its US GAAP
financial statements for equity compensation plans will not be the same as the expenses recorded in the Roche
Group IFRS financial statements for these same plans.
There are other differences between IFRS and US GAAP, but these have a relatively minor impact.
Genentech stock repurchases
On 15 June 2005 Genentech’s Board of Directors authorised an extension of the current stock repurchase
programme to repurchase up to a further 2 billion US dollars of Genentech’s common stock through 30 June 2006.
Initially in December 2003 Genentech’s Board of Directors had authorised a stock repurchase programme to
repurchase up to 1 billion US dollars of Genentech’s common stock, which was extended by an additional 1 billion
US dollars in September 2004. In 2005 Genentech repurchased common stock worth 2,016 million US dollars or
2,511million Swiss francs (2004: 1,352 million US dollars or 1,680 million Swiss francs).
Oceanside biologics manufacturing facility
On 23 June 2005 Genentech completed the purchase of the Oceanside biologics manufacturing facility in
SanDiego, California, from Biogen Idec. The purchase cost, including closing costs, was 531 million Swiss francs.
Genentech Senior Notes
On 18 July 2005 Genentech completed a private placement of 2 billion US dollars aggregate principal amount of
5-year, 10-year and 30-year Senior Notes. The placement consists of 500 million US dollars of 4.40% Senior Notes
due 2010, 1 billion US dollars of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2015 and 500 million US dollars of 5.25% Senior Notes
due 2035. Genentech has used and intends to use the proceeds for reduction or repayment of certain lease
arrangements, for funding future capital expenditure, including upgrade, start-up and validation costs at
Oceanside and for general corporate purposes. Further details are given in Note 30.
Genentech leases
During the third quarter of 2005 Genentech paid 585 million US dollars to buy out the finance lease obligations
in respect of its manufacturing facility at Vacaville, California and certain buildings on its South San Francisco
site. The carrying value of these obligations at 31 December 2004 was 577 million US dollars (653 million Swiss
francs).
In December 2004 Genentech entered into a Master Lease Agreement with Slough SSF LLC for the lease of
property adjacent to Genentech’s South San Francisco site. The lease will take place in two phases. Phase 1
building leases will begin in 2006 and Phase 2 building leases may begin as early as 2008. Under IFRS the leases
will be accounted for as finance leases. Genentech expects that, at the completion of the project, total spending
on owned improvements to leased assets will be in excess of 365 million US dollars. Total lease payments
contemplated by the Master Lease Agreement until 2020 are currently estimated at 540 million US dollars.

Effective 1 October 2002 the Roche Group and Chugai completed an alliance to create a leading research-
driven Japanese pharmaceutical company, which was formed by the merger of Chugai and Roche’s Japanese
pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Nippon Roche. The merged company, known as Chugai, is a fully consolidated
subsidiary of the Group. At 31 December 2005 the Group’s interest in Chugai was 50.6% (2004: 50.6%).
48 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The common stock of Chugai is publicly traded and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the stock code
‘TSE: 4519’. Chugai prepares financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
Japan (JGAAP). These are filed on a quarterly basis with the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Differences between IFRS and JGAAP
Due to certain consolidation entries and differences in the requirements of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and JGAAP, there are differences between Chugai’s stand-alone financial results on a JGAAP
basis and the financial results of Chugai as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS.
The acquiring by Roche of a 50.1% interest in Chugai is treated as an acquisition for IFRS. For JGAAP the alliance
is treated as a merger between Chugai and Nippon Roche. Therefore the JGAAP results of Chugai do not include
the goodwill and fair value adjustments that are recorded in Roche’s results, and which are quantified in the table
below. Moreover the acquisition accounting only includes Roche’s 50.1% of these fair value adjustments and
therefore the impact of these on net income needs to be added back in the minority interest calculations in
Roche’s IFRS results.
In Roche’s IFRS results, depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line
method. In Chugai’s JGAAP results the reducing balance method is used. Additionally certain income and
expenses, notably some restructuring costs, are required by JGAAP to be reported as extraordinary items. In
Chugai’s JGAAP results extraordinary items are reported below the operating profit line. In Roche’s IFRS results
such items are normally included as part of operating profit and are not treated as extraordinary or exceptional
items. Restructuring costs were 56 million Swiss francs (2004: 64 million Swiss francs). There are other differences
between IFRS and JGAAP, but these have a relatively minor impact.

The dividends distributed to third parties holding Chugai shares during 2005 totalled 5,711 million Japanese yen
or 65 million Swiss francs (2004: 5,952 million Japanese yen or 68 million Swiss francs) and have been recorded
against minority interests (see Note 33). Dividends paid by Chugai to Roche are eliminated on consolidation as
inter-company items.
Finance Report 2005 49Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Restructuring of production facilities
On 28 February 2005 Chugai announced a restructuring of its production facilities, under which five existing
plants will be integrated into two facilities within the next five to six years. As part of this restructuring the plant
at Kagamiishi was sold during the first half of 2005. Total restructuring costs, including the loss on disposal of the
Kagamiishi plant, were 56 million Swiss francs. This is shown as an extraordinary loss in Chugai’s JGAAP financial
statements.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
In the second half of 2005 Chugai returned part of its employees’ pension fund to the Japanese government.
As a result of this there was a settlement gain of 127 million Swiss francs. In accordance with the Group’s
management and organisational structure this is reported as general and administration expenses within the
Corporate business segment. This is shown as an extraordinary gain in Chugai’s JGAAP financial statements.
Chugai OTC
Effective 29 December 2004 Chugai sold its OTC business to Lion Corporation. A pre-tax gain on disposal of
103 million Swiss francs was recorded. The results of Chugai’s OTC business in 2004 are included in the profit
from discontinued businesses. See also Note 11.
Early retirement programme
On 18 May 2004 Chugai announced an early retirement programme with a retirement date of 30 September 2004.
At the end of the application period on 6 August 2004 a total of 216 employees had applied for the programme.
Restructuring costs of 4.2 billion Japanese yen (48 million Swiss francs) were recorded for this programme in
2004. This was shown as an extraordinary loss in Chugai’s JGAAP financial statements.
Share repurchases
During 2004 Chugai repurchased 1,000,000 of its common shares for a total consideration of 1.6 billion Japanese
yen (19 million Swiss francs). As a result the Group’s ownership in Chugai increased to 50.6%. There were no
share repurchases in 2005.
Chugai convertible bonds
Details of the ‘Series 6 Chugai Pharmaceutical Unsecured Convertible Bonds’, including conversions during the

Income from out-licensing agreements
Certain Group companies receive from third parties up-front, milestone and other similar non-refundable
payments relating to the sale or licensing of products or technology. Revenue associated with performance
milestones is recognised based on achievement of the milestones, as defined in the respective agreements.
Revenue from non-refundable up-front payments and licence fees is initially reported as deferred income and is
recognised in income as earned over the period of the development collaboration or the manufacturing obligation.
50 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Gains on disposal of products
As part of the continuous realignment of its product portfolio, the Group periodically disposes of product
lines that are no longer considered as core products or priorities within the product development portfolio.
The proceeds are reinvested in the Group’s in-licensing arrangements and other research and development
alliances and collaborations.
On 9 February 2004 the Group announced the sale of the exclusive US rights to Soriatane to Connetics
Corporation. The cash received was 155 million Swiss francs. On 1 August 2004 the Group agreed to license and
sell certain patent rights from its patent portfolio to a third party. The cash received was 188 million Swiss francs.
For all of these disposals the products concerned had no book value and so the gain on disposal was the
same as the cash proceeds. All of these disposals are reported within the segment results of the ‘Roche
Pharmaceuticals’ business segment.

Roche Diagnostics GmbH (‘RDG’) and SmithKline Beecham (Cork) Ltd (‘SB’) are party to arbitration concerning
RDG’s termination in 1998 of the Carvedilol License Agreement of 1987, as amended in 1995, relating to the
licensing and co-marketing of carvedilol. RDG has submitted two claims for damages to two Arbitration Tribunals
in Zurich and SB has submitted a counterclaim asserting the invalidity of RDG’s termination and claiming
damages. Based on the development of the current arbitration and settlement negotiations, the Group has
increased its existing provisions by 210 million Swiss francs in 2005. This additional expense, which is recorded
as part of the Roche Pharmaceuticals segment result, is disclosed separately in the income statement due to
the materiality of the amount and in order to fairly present the Group’s results. The total amount of provisions
recorded by RDG is not disclosed as this may seriously prejudice RDG’s position in this matter.
Genentech legal cases
On 10 June 2002 Genentech announced that a Los Angeles County Superior Court jury voted to award City of
Hope Medical Center (‘City of Hope’) approximately 300 million US dollars in compensatory damages based on a
finding of a breach of a 1976 agreement between Genentech and the City of Hope. On 24 June 2002 the jury voted
to award City of Hope 200 million US dollars in punitive damages in the same case. On 13 September 2002
Genentech filed a notice of appeal of the jury verdict and damages awards with the California Court of Appeal.
On 21 October 2004 the Court of Appeal affirmed the verdict and damages awards in all respects. Also, on
21 October 2004 Genentech announced that it would seek review by the California Supreme Court, which has
discretion over which cases it will review. On 24 November 2004 Genentech filed its petition for review by the
California Supreme Court and on 2 February 2005 the California Supreme Court granted this petition. A full
provision, which is classified as long-term, has been recorded for the damages awards. During the appeals
process interest accrues on the total amount of the damages at a simple annual rate of 10%. Following the
judgement, interest of 62 million Swiss francs (2004: 61 million Swiss francs) was recorded as the time cost of
provisions, within financing costs. On 3 October 2002 Genentech entered into an arrangement with third-party
insurance companies to post a surety bond of 600 million US dollars in connection with this judgement. As part
of this arrangement Genentech pledged 630 million US dollars in cash and investments to secure this bond.
Thiswas increased in 2004 by 52 million US dollars to 682 million US dollars and in 2005 by a further 53million
US dollars to 735 million US dollars (966 million Swiss francs). This amount is reported as restricted cash within
financial long-term assets (see Note 19). In the 2004 consolidated financial statements, which were approved
prior to the 2 February 2005 decision of the California Supreme Court referred to above, the provisions and
restricted cash in respect of this litigation were classified as current. Following the 2 February 2005 decision these
have been reclassified in the 2005 financial statements from current to non-current, as a resolution of this matter
is now expected to take more than one year. Comparative 2004 information has not been restated.
Finance Report 2005 51Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
On 12 August 2002 the United States Patent and Trademark Office declared an interference between Chiron
US Patent No. 6,054,561 and a patent application exclusively licensed to Genentech from the University of
Pennsylvania relating to anti-HER2 antibodies. In declaring the interference, the US Patent and Trademark Office
has determined that there is substantial question as to whether the inventors of the Chiron patent were the first
to invent the technology involved and are entitled to the patent. Subsequently the US Patent and Trademark Office
redeclared the interference to include, in addition to the above-referenced Chiron patent and university patent
application, a number of patents and patent applications owned by either Chiron or Genentech, including a
Chiron patent that is also at issue in a second patent infringement lawsuit filed on 13 March 2001 against
Genentech by Chiron. On 30 November 2004 the US Patent and Trademark Office issued rulings on several
preliminary motions. These rulings terminated both interferences involving the patent application referenced
above that Genentech licensed from a university, redeclared interferences between the Genentech and Chiron
patents and patent applications, and made several determinations which could affect the validity of the
Genentech and Chiron patents and patent applications involved in the remaining interferences. On 28 January
2005 Genentech filed a notice of appeal with the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On 1 June Genentech
and Chiron agreed to a settlement of both these interference proceedings.
On 4 October 2004 Genentech received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice, requesting
documents related to the promotion of Rituxan, a prescription product approved for the treatment of relapsed or
refractory, low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Genentech is co-operating
with the associated investigation, which, as Genentech has been advised, is both civil and criminal in nature. The
potential outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
On 13 May 2005 a request was filed by a third party for re-examination of US Patent No. 6,331,415 (‘the Cabilly
patent’) that is co-owned by Genentech and City of Hope. On 7 July 2005 the US Patent and Trademark Office
ordered a re-examination of this patent. On 13 September 2005 the US Patent and Trademark Office issued
aninitial ‘non-final’Office action rejecting the claims of the patent. This action is a routine and expected next step
in the re-examination procedure. Because the re-examination process is ongoing, the final outcome of this matter
cannot be determined at this time. A second re-examination request for this same patent was filed on
23December 2005 by another third party. The US Patent and Trademark Office has not yet taken any action with
respect to this additional request. The Cabilly patent, which expires in 2018, relates to methods used by
Genentech and others to make certain antibodies or antibody fragments, as well as cells and DNA used in these
methods. Genentech has licensed the Cabilly patent to other companies and derives significant royalties from
these licences. The claims of the Cabilly patent remain valid and enforceable throughout the re-examination
process.
On 29 July 2005 a former Genentech employee, whose employment ended in April 2005, filed a non-public (Qui
Tam) complaint under seal in the United States District Court for the District of Maine against Genentech and
Biogen Idec, alleging violations of the False Claims Act and retaliatory discharge of employment. On 20 December
2005 the USFederal Government filed notice of its election to decline intervention in the lawsuit. The complaint
was subsequently unsealed and Genentech was served on 5 January 2006. Genentech is evaluating the complaint.
Thepotential outcome cannot be determined at this time.
Genentech’s annual report and quarterly SEC filings contain the detailed disclosures on litigation matters that are
required by US GAAP. These include further details on the above matters as well as including information on other
litigation that is not currently as significant as the matters referred to above.
Diagnostics legal cases
During 2005 provisions for certain litigation and arbitration matters in the Diagnostics Division were increased
by146 million Swiss francs. The provisions recorded are based on current litigation and settlement negotiations
and recent settlement agreements. This additional expense is disclosed separately in the income statement
duetothe materiality of the amount and in order to fairly present the Group’s results. Payments in 2005 totalled
98 million Swiss francs.
52 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
On 9 October 2003 Applera Corporation (‘Applera’) filed suit against the Group in the Superior Court of California
and filed a Notice of Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association. Both the Superior Court lawsuit and
the arbitration demand made claims concerning the interpretation and enforcement of contracts between the
Group and Applera for the commercialisation of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. The claims
sought termination of certain contracts, declarations regarding rights and obligations under those contracts,
and monetary damages and other relief in an unspecified amount for alleged breaches of various agreements
between the parties. On 15 December 2003, the Group filed its response in the arbitration proceeding. On
thesame day, the Group also responded to Applera’s complaint in the Superior Court proceeding by petitioning
the Court to compel arbitration of the claims alleged by Applera and to stay the lawsuit pending completion of
the arbitration. On 22 October 2004 the Court of Appeal of the State of California ruled that the petition to compel
arbitration should be granted and remanded the case to the Superior Court, with directions to grant the petition.
On 9 May 2005 the Group announced that a settlement agreement had been reached with Applera with regard
to the outstanding litigation and arbitration related to contractual relationships involving rights to and
commercialisation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology.
In 1992 the Group filed a suit against the Promega Corporation (‘Promega’) alleging patent infringement and
breach of a licence agreement relating to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. In May 2004 the US
District Court of the Northern District of California decided that one of the patents concerned was unenforceable
and rejected the breach of licence claim. On 12 November 2003 the Group was notified that Promega had filed a
non-public (Qui Tam) action against the Group with the US District Court of the Eastern District of West Virginia
in March 2000. This complaint, filed under the False Claims Act, alleges that the US Federal Government was
overcharged in its purchase of PCR enzyme products. In July 2003 the US Federal Government notified the Court
of its decision not to intervene in Promega’s complaint and on 12 November 2003 the Court ordered the complaint
of 2000 to be unsealed. The Group filed a motion to dismiss this complaint and on 20 August 2004 the Court
dismissed the complaint with prejudice. On 12 September 2005 the Group announced that a settlement
agreement had been reached with Promega with regard to all outstanding litigation related to polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) technology.

Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Acquisitions – 2005
GlycArt: Effective 25 July 2005 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in GlycArt Biotechnology Ltd.
(hereafter ‘GlycArt’), a privately owned biotechnology research company based in Schlieren, Zurich, in
Switzerland. GlycArt is reported as part of the Roche Pharmaceuticals business segment. The purchase
consideration paid was 235 million Swiss francs, which has been allocated as follows:
GlycArt acquisition: net assets acquired in millions of CHF
Carrying value Carrying value
prior to acquisition upon acquisition
Goodwill – 75
Intangible assets: in-process research and development – 178
Intangible assets: core technology – 20
Property, plant and equipment 3 3
Deferred income taxes – (42)
Cash 4 4
Other net assets (liabilities) (3) (3)
Total 4 235
Goodwill was recognised resulting from the premium paid for the acquisition. This represents synergies that can
be obtained from the Group’s existing business utilising the acquired core technology. Intangible assets for core
technology are amortised on a straight-line basis over 14 years, beginning 1 August 2005. Intangible assets for
in-process research and development will be amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis beginning
from the point when they are available for use. Subsequent to acquisition, GlycArt contributed a net expense of
9million Swiss francs to the Roche Pharmaceuticals business result. If GlycArt had been acquired at 1 January
2005, the revenues of the Group would be unchanged and the Group’s net income would be lower by a further
7million Swiss francs compared to the reported results.
Acquisitions – 2004
Igen: On 13 February 2004 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Igen International Inc. (‘Igen’),
apublic company headquartered in Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA. The acquisition gives the Group broad access
to the human in-vitro diagnostics immunochemistry sector through the use of electrochemiluminiscence (ECL)
technology in further development of the Elecsys product line. The acquisition was approved by an extraordinary
general meeting of Igen’s shareholders on 13 February 2004 and was cleared by the relevant antitrust authorities.
The allocation of the total purchase consideration of 1,823 million Swiss francs was as follows:
Igen acquisition: net assets acquired in millions of CHF
Goodwill 1,315
Intangible assets 740
Deferred income taxes (166)
Cash 8
Other net assets (liabilities) (74)

Financing costs include net gains on financial liabilities at fair-value-through-profit-or-loss of 41 million Swiss
francs (2004: net loss of 5 million Swiss francs). This is included within gains (losses) on interest rate derivatives,
net. This amount also includes the change in the fair value that is attributable to changes in the liabilities’ credit
risk component. The change in fair value due to credit risk is calculated comparing the difference between the
present value of the future cash flows on the bonds, discounted by using a swap (LIBOR) yield curve, and the
market prices of the bonds. Due to a decrease of the credit spread relative to the swap yield curve, the credit risk
component resulted in a loss of 10 million Swiss francs (2004: gain of 7 million Swiss francs). The cumulative
change in fair value that is attributable to the change in credit risk since issuance of the instruments is a gain of
17 million Swiss francs. Interest expense on liabilities at fair-value-through-profit-or-loss was 105 million Swiss
francs (2004: 125 million Swiss francs).
Exceptional income from bond conversion and redemption
During 2004 the Group converted or redeemed certain of its debt instruments. Debt was reduced by 4,026 million
Swiss francs, the total cash outflow was 3,039 million Swiss francs and a net pre-tax gain of 872 million Swiss
francs resulted as shown below. This net gain is disclosed separately in the income statement due to the

Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry forwards only to the extent that realisation of
the related tax benefit is probable. The Group has unrecognised tax losses, including valuation allowances, of
138 million Swiss francs (2004: 172 million Swiss francs), of which 47 million Swiss francs expire within three
yearsand 40 million Swiss francs expire within five years. The remaining 51 million Swiss francs of losses expire
after fifteen years or more. Deferred income tax liabilities have not been established for the withholding tax and
other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, as such amounts
are currently regarded as permanently reinvested. These unremitted earnings totalled 30.8 billion Swiss francs
at31 December 2005 (2004: 27.4 billion Swiss francs).

Divestment of Consumer Health (OTC) business
On 19 July 2004 the Group announced the sale of Roche Consumer Health, its global OTC (over-the-counter
medicines) business, to the Bayer Group. The sale also included five production facilities belonging to the Roche
Pharmaceuticals business. Under the agreement with Bayer the majority of local businesses were transferred to
Bayer at the end of 2004. By 31 December 2004, 98% of the divestment to Bayer was completed, measured
interms of Roche Consumer Health sales to third parties. The divestment of the remaining 2% was completed in
2005. Under the terms of the agreement the majority of cash proceeds, totalling 2,886 million Swiss francs, were
transferred to the Group on 1 January 2005. In addition in 2005 the Group received a further 16 million Swiss
francs for the remaining part of the divestment that was completed in 2005.
On 30 July 2004 Chugai announced the sale of its OTC business to Lion Corporation. This sale was completed
effective 29 December 2004.
The results of the Consumer Health (OTC) business are shown above. The results for 2005 include the remaining
part of Roche Consumer Health that was transferred to Bayer in 2005. The 2004 results include the whole
Consumer Health (OTC) business for that period.

In the above table the 2004 figures include preliminary assessments of the net debt adjustments and other
purchase price mechanisms as well as initial calculations of the impairment and restructuring charges and
accruals for residual obligations retained by the Roche Group.
The cash inflow from the disposal in 2004 was 696 million Swiss francs, which is net of cash balances of 38 million
Swiss francs held by companies within the Consumer Health (OTC) business and cash payments for transaction
costs of 81 million Swiss francs. Under the terms of the agreement the majority of cash proceeds, totalling
2,886million Swiss francs, were transferred to the Group on 1 January 2005. This amount is shown as a receivable
in the 31 December 2004 balance sheet. The cash inflow from the disposal in 2005 totals 2,902 million
Swissfrancs, which consists of the 2,886 million francs received from Bayer on 1 January 2005 and the additional
16 million Swiss francs received from the parts of the business that were sold to Bayer in 2005.

Continuing businesses: Roche Pharmaceuticals business segment
The five production facilities included in the sale to Bayer are shown as part of the Roche Pharmaceuticals results
until the date of disposal. All five production facilities were transferred to Bayer at the end of 2004 and therefore
are not included in the 31 December 2004 balance sheet.
In connection with the divestment of Roche Consumer Health, in 2004 the Roche Pharmaceuticals business
reassessed the utilisation of its manufacturing facilities, infrastructure and service capacities. In addition,
under the terms of the agreement with Bayer, the Roche Pharmaceuticals business agreed certain interim
manufacturing and service obligations with Bayer. As a result the Roche Pharmaceuticals business recorded an
impairment charge in 2004 based on the estimated net selling price as shown in the table below.

Divestment of Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business
Effective 30 September 2003, after receiving the final regulatory approvals, the Group completed the sale of its
global Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business (‘the VFC business’) to the Dutch company DSM. Under the terms
of the final purchase agreement with DSM, there were certain agreed purchase price adjustment mechanisms.
During 2005 the final amounts arising from these mechanisms were approved by the Group and DSM. No
additional cash was transferred between the Group and DSM and no additional amounts were recorded.
Following the sale of the VFC business, certain assets and liabilities of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division,
mainly associated with the vitamin case, remain with the Group. These are described below in the section on the
vitamin case. In addition the Group has given DSM certain indemnities in respect of any remedial actions at the
sites of the VFC business that may be required by environmental laws. Further arrangements were put in place
regarding utilisation of certain assets and certain purchasing contracts as well as adopting DSM as a preferred
supplier for pharmaceutical ingredients. Under one of these arrangements, the Group has guaranteed to
purchase for a period of four years beginning 1 January 2004 products with a sales value totalling 100 million
euros. The Group will reimburse DSM for 75% of any unutilised amounts. The other arrangements consist of
certain residual obligations, which have been fully accrued for. During 2005 expenses of 9 million Swiss francs
were recorded (2004: 12 million Swiss francs), which mostly represent the after-tax amortisation of discounted
liabilities.
Vitamin case
Following the settlement agreement with the US Department of Justice on 20 May 1999 regarding pricing
practices in the vitamin market and the overall settlement agreement to a class action suit brought by the US
buyers of bulk vitamins, the Group recorded provisions in respect of the vitamin case in 1999. These provisions
were the Group’s best estimate at that time of the total liability that may arise, taking into account currency
movements and the time value of money. Provisions for legal fees were recorded separately. The Group recorded
additional provisions in 2001 and 2002, based on the development of the litigation and settlement negotiations in
the US, Europe and elsewhere.
60 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
On 17 January 2003 the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a class action litigation brought on
behalf of non-US purchasers of bulk vitamins from the Group and other manufacturers that non-US plaintiffs may
bring claims in US courts under US anti-trust laws for alleged damages suffered from transactions outside the
United States. On 14 June 2004 the Supreme Court of the United States nullified the decision of the District of
Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the lower court to review alternative
arguments which might permit such claims to proceed in the United States. On remand, on 28 June 2005 a panel
of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that US courts do not have jurisdiction
over the plaintiffs’ claims and affirmed the initial dismissal of the complaint. On 26 October 2005 the plaintiffs
petitioned the US Supreme Court for further discretionary review. On 9 January 2006 the US Supreme Court
issued an order denying the plaintiffs’ petition. Plaintiffs have twenty five days from the date of the order to seek
reconsideration. No provisions have been recorded in respect of this litigation as the Group does not anticipate
an unfavourable outcome.
Total payments during the year were 82 million Swiss francs (2004: 66 million Swiss francs), which were charged
against the provisions previously recorded.
The Group is seeking to resolve the remaining outstanding issues; however the timing and the final amounts
involved are uncertain. The remaining provisions recorded total 55 million Swiss francs and are based on current
litigation and recent settlement agreements. These provisions are all considered as short-term as cash outflows
are expected to arise during 2006 and are not discounted as the time value of money is not considered material
in this case. As the litigation and negotiations progress, it is possible that the ultimate liability may be different
from the amount of provisions currently recorded.
As part of the divestment of the VFC business, the liabilities in respect of the vitamin case, which are discussed
above, remain with the Roche Group. Roche and DSM have signed an Indemnity and Co-operation Agreement
under which Roche may provide DSM with certain indemnities and guarantees in connection with the vitamin
case.

Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
13. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Most employees are covered by retirement benefit plans sponsored by Group companies. The nature of such
plans varies according to legal regulations, fiscal requirements and economic conditions of the countries in which
the employees are employed. The major plans are defined benefit plans, the largest of which are located in
Switzerland, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and Japan. Other post-employment benefits consist
mostly of post-retirement healthcare and life insurance schemes, principally in the United States. Plans are
usually funded by payments from the Group and by employees to trusts independent of the Group’s finances.
Where a plan is unfunded, notably for the major defined benefit plans in Germany, a liability for the obligation is
recorded in the Group’s balance sheet.

(Gains) losses on curtailment (15) (5)
(Gains) losses on settlement (127) –
Limit on asset recognition 79 56
Total included in employees’ remuneration 313 532
The actual return on plan assets was 1,181 million Swiss francs (2004: 848 million Swiss francs).
As disclosed in Note 5, in the second half of 2005 Chugai returned part of its employees’ pension fund to the
Japanese government, which resulted in a settlement gain of 127 million Swiss francs. In accordance with the
Group’s management and organisational structure this is reported as general and administration expenses within
the Corporate business segment.
Effective 1 January 2006 the Group will apply IAS 19 (revised) ‘Employee Benefits’. Amongst other matters,
therevised standard allows actuarial gains and losses from defined benefit plans to be recorded directly to equity.
In this case adjustments arising from the limits on recognition of assets for defined benefit plans are also to be
recorded directly to equity. The revised standard requires retrospective application and consequently the Group
estimates that in the restated 2005 results pre-tax expenses included in employees’ remuneration will be
approximately 196 million Swiss francs lower, of which 193 million Swiss francs relates to continuing businesses
and 3 million Swiss francs relates to discontinued businesses.

In December 2004 the Group paid an additional contribution of 150 million Swiss francs into one of its Swiss post-
employment defined benefit plans. This payment is included in ‘Contributions paid’ in the table above and has
been accounted for as part of the recognised surplus on funded pension plans in the Group’s consolidated
financial statements in 2004. Thereafter it is included in the actuarial calculation of the Group’s pension expenses
and balances.

14. Employee stock options and other equity compensation benefits
The Group operates several equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Genentech and Chugai.
Effective 1 January 2005 the Group adopted IFRS 2: ‘Share-based Payment’. Amongst other matters, the new
standard requires that the fair value of all equity compensation plan awards granted to employees be estimated
at grant date and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. The expense is charged against the appropriate
income statement heading. The standard also requires retrospective application, within certain transitional
requirements. Further details are given in Note 1.

Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Roche Long-Term: During 2005 the Group implemented a new global long-term incentive programme which
is available to certain directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The
programme consists of Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) with the Group having the alternative
of granting awards under the existing Roche Option Plan.
Share option plans
Roche Option Plan: Awards under this plan give employees the right to purchase non-voting equity securities at
an exercise price specified at the grant date. The options, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a
seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years, subject to continued employment. The Group covers
such obligations by purchasing non-voting equity securities, or derivatives thereon (see Note 31). With the
introduction of Roche Long-Term in 2005, the number of options granted under the Roche Option Plan has been
significantly reduced, as most eligible employees now receive Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights instead.

In April 2004 Genentech’s shareholders approved an equity incentive plan. The plans allow for the granting of
various stock options, incentive stock options and stock purchase rights to employees, directors and consultants
of Genentech. No incentive stock options and stock purchase rights have been granted under this plan to date.
The options which have been granted, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a ten-year duration

Volatility was determined by reference to historically observed prices of the underlying equity. Risk-free interest
rates are derived from zero coupon swap rates at the grant date taken from Datastream. The early exercise factor
describes the ratio between the expected market price at the exercise date and the exercise price at which early
exercises can be expected, based on historically observed behaviour. For the Chugai grants in 2005 it was
assumed that all awards would be held for the full term length, since none of the previously issued options had
ever been exercised early.
Other equity compensation plans
Roche Connect: This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the United States and
certain other countries, to make regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting equity securities.
It is administered by independent third parties. The Group contributes to the programme, which allows the
employees to purchase non-voting equity securities at a discount (usually 20%). The administrator purchases the
necessary non-voting equity securities directly from the market. At 31 December 2005 the administrator held
713,108 non-voting equity securities (2004: 511,574). The programme has been operational since 1 October 2002.
During the year the cost of the plan was 9 million Swiss francs (2004: 7 million Swiss francs), which was reported
within the relevant expenditure line by function.
Genentech Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP): Genentech has an employee stock purchase
programme that allows employees to purchase Genentech’s common stock at 85% of the lower of market value
at the grant date or purchase date. In 2005 a total of 1,872 thousand shares of Genentech common stock were
purchased (2004: 1,717 thousand shares) resulting in a cash inflow of 93 million Swiss francs (2004: 73 million
Swiss francs). During the year the cost of the plan was 27 million Swiss francs (2004: 4 million Swiss francs), which
was reported within the relevant expenditure line by function.
Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights: With the introduction of Roche Long-Term in 2005, the Group
offers Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) to certain directors, management and employees
selected at the discretion of the Group. The S-SARs give employees the right to receive non-voting equity
securities reflecting the value of any appreciation in the market price of the non-voting equity securities between
the grant date and the exercise date. The options, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a seven-
year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years, subject to continued employment. The Group covers
such obligations by purchasing non-voting equity securities, or derivatives thereon (see Note 31).

The weighted average fair value of the options granted in 2005 was calculated using a binomial model. The inputs
to the model were consistent with those used for the Roche Option Plan 2005 awards as shown previously. The
resulting weighted average fair value per right is CHF 20.50, giving a total fair value of 82 million Swiss francs
which is charged over the vesting period of three years.
Roche Performance Share Plan: The Group offers future non-voting equity security awards (or at the Board’s
discretion, their cash equivalent) to certain directors and key senior managers. The programme was established
at the beginning of 2002 and was in effect for three years. During 2004 the Board approved a new three-year cycle
of the Roche Performance Share Plan (PSP) to operate during 2005–2007. The amount of non-voting equity
securities allocated will depend upon the individual’s salary level, the achievement of performance targets linked
to the Group’s total shareholders’ return (shares and non-voting equity securities combined) relative to the
Group’s peers during the three-year period from the date of the grant and the discretion of the Board of Directors.
For the 2005–2007 cycle a total of 231,200 awards have been made which are non-tradable equity-settled awards.
Each award will result in between zero and two non-voting equity securities, depending upon the achievement of
the performance targets, being allocated to the recipients in February 2008 after a blackout period has ended.
The weighted average fair value of the options granted in 2005 was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation.
The input parameters to the model were the covariance matrix between Roche and the other individual companies
of the peer group based on a three-year history and a risk-free rate of 1.61%. The valuation also takes into account
the defined rank and performance structure which determines the payout of the PSP. The resulting value per one
unit of PSP from the 2005–2007 cycle is CHF 145.39, giving a total fair value of 34 million Swiss francs which is
charged over the vesting period of three years.
Roche Stock Appreciation Rights: Some employees of certain North American subsidiaries of the Group
receive Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) as part of their compensation. The SARs, which are non-tradable cash-
settled awards, may be exercised after a vesting period of between one and three years for a cash payment, based
upon the amount that the market price of the Group’s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) at the point
ofexercise exceeds the strike price (grant price at issuance). Following the implementation of Roche Long-Term
(see above), the Group does not plan to award any further cash-settled SARs and no awards were made in 2005.

Finance Report 2005 69Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The decrease in property, plant and equipment in 2004 of 423 million Swiss francs from the disposal of the OTC
business consists of assets transferred with the business of 240 million Swiss francs and an impairment charge
of 183 million Swiss francs (see Note 11). Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future
cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal. Factors such as changes in the
planned use of buildings, machinery or equipment, or closure of facilities, the presence or absence of competition
and technical obsolescence could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
Leasing arrangements where the Group is the lessee
Finance leases: As at 31 December 2005 the capitalised cost of property, plant and equipment under finance
leases was 199 million Swiss francs (2004: 867 million Swiss francs) and the net book value of these assets was
106 million Swiss francs (2004: 640 million Swiss francs).

As described in Note 4, in the third quarter of 2005 Genentech bought out the finance lease obligations in respect
of its manufacturing facility at Vacaville, California, and certain buildings on its South San Francisco site. The
carrying value of these lease obligations at 31 December 2004 was 653 million Swiss francs.
Operating leases: Group companies are party to a number of operating leases, mainly for plant and machinery,
including motor vehicles, and for certain short-term property rentals. The arrangements do not impose any
significant restrictions on the Group. Total operating lease rental expense was 337 million Swiss francs (2004:
245million Swiss francs).

Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The accumulated allowance for uncollectible minimum lease payments was 3 million Swiss francs (2004: zero
million Swiss francs). There were no contingent rents recognised in income.
Operating leases: Certain assets, mainly some diagnostics instruments, are leased to third parties though
operating lease arrangements. Such assets are reported within property, plant and equipment. Lease income from
operating leases is recognised over the lease term on a straight line basis.
At 31 December 2005, machinery and equipment with an original cost of 1,503 million Swiss francs and a net book
value of 601 million Swiss francs was being leased to third parties. Future minimum lease payments under non-
cancellable leases totalled 131 million Swiss francs, of which 44 million Swiss francs was due within one year,
86million Swiss francs was due between one and five years and 1 million Swiss francs was due after five years.
There was no contingent rent recognised as income.
Capital commitments
The Group has capital commitments for the purchase or construction of property, plant and equipment totalling
1.2 billion Swiss francs (2004: 1.5 billion Swiss francs). In addition on 15 December 2004 Genentech entered into
a Master Lease Agreement for the lease of property in South San Francisco. Genentech’s aggregate lease
payments through 2020 are estimated at approximately 540 million US dollars.

There are no accumulated impairment losses in goodwill. The goodwill arising from investments in associated
companies is classified as part of the investments in associated companies (see Note 18).
Effective 1 January 2005 the Group has implemented IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’. Amongst other matters,
the new standard requires that amortisation of goodwill cease from the date of implementation. Goodwill will
continue to be tested for impairment. The standard requires prospective application. Had this standard been
applied in 2004 goodwill amortisation expenses of 579 million Swiss francs would not have been recorded. No
additional impairment would have been necessary.
Finance Report 2005 71Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Goodwill impairment testing
The Group’s reportable business segments are the cash-generating units used for the testing of goodwill.
Pharmaceuticals Division: For Genentech and Chugai, the recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs to
sell, determined with reference to publicly quoted share price of Genentech and Chugai shares. The goodwill in the
Roche Pharmaceuticals business is not significant in comparison with the Group’s total carrying amount of goodwill.
Diagnostics Division: The recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is based on value in use. The cash
flow projections used are based on the most recent business plans approved by management. These assume
no significant changes in the organisation of the division and include management’s latest estimates on sales
volume and pricing, and production and other operating costs. These reflect past experience and are projected
over five years. The discount rate used is based on a rate of 8.4%, which is derived from a capital asset pricing
model using data from Swiss and US capital markets, including Swiss Federal Government 10-year bonds,
US Treasury 10-year Bonds, and the SMI and SP500 indices. This is then adjusted to a pre-tax rate of 12.9%.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would not cause the
carrying value of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.

of the global rights to Kytril (granisetron) from SmithKline Beecham. The Diagnostics business segment includes
intangible assets with a carrying value of 2,166 million Swiss francs and a remaining amortisation period of
12 years that relate to the acquisition of Corange/Boehringer-Mannheim and intangible assets with a carrying
value of 673 million Swiss francs and a remaining amortisation period of 11 years that relate to the acquisition of
Igen. The Group currently has no internally generated intangible assets from development as the criteria for the
recognition as an asset are not met. Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash
flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal. Factors such as the presence or
absence of competition, technical obsolescence or lower than anticipated sales for products with capitalised
rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.

are generally measured at cost, as their fair value cannot be measured reliably. These are primarily investments
in private biotechnology companies, which are kept as part of the Group’s strategic alliance efforts. The carrying
value of equity investments held at cost is 24 million Swiss francs (2004: 19 million Swiss francs). The effective
interest rate of held-to-maturity investments is 3.7% (2004: 1.5%). Loans receivable comprise all loans to third
parties with a term of over one year. Restricted cash in 2005 includes 966 million Swiss francs of cash and
investments pledged by Genentech in connection with the City of Hope litigation (see Note 7). The equivalent
amount in 2004 was classified as other current assets (see Note 22).

Hedge accounting
The Group’s accounting policy on hedge accounting, which is described in Note 1, requires that to qualify for
hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability of
occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
76 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
As described in Note 2, the Group has financial risk management policies for foreign exchange risk, interest rate
risk, market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. When deemed appropriate, certain of the above risks are altered
through the use of derivatives. While many of these transactions can be considered as hedges in economic terms,
if the required conditions are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case
thehedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship,
which means that any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial income.
The Group generally limits the use of hedge accounting to certain significant transactions. Consequently as at
31December 2005 the Group has no fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investment in a foreign
entity that meet the strict requirements to qualify for hedge accounting, apart from those described below.
Genentech has hedged some of its fixed term debt instruments with interest rate swaps. As at 31 December 2005
such instruments, which have been designated and qualify as fair value hedges, are recorded in the balance sheet
as a liability with a fair value of 10 million Swiss francs.
Genentech has non-US dollar cash flows from future royalty income and development expenses expected over
the next one to five years. To hedge part of this transaction exposure Genentech enters into derivative financial
instruments such as options and forward contracts. Genentech has equity investments in various biotechnology
companies that are subject to a greater risk of market fluctuation than the stock market in general. To manage
part of this exposure Genentech enters into derivative financial instruments such as zero cost collars and forward
contracts. As at 31 December 2005 such instruments, which are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, are
recorded in the balance sheet with a fair value of 153 million Swiss francs. These matters are also described in
Genentech’s annual report and quarterly SEC filings.
Movements on the fair value reserve for designated cash flow hedges are included in Note 31.

Environmental and legal provisions
These provisions include 212 million Swiss francs (2004: 181 million Swiss francs) for environmental matters
and 1,366 million Swiss francs (2004: 1,017 million Swiss francs) for litigation, including major legal cases and
thevitamin case.
Provisions for environmental matters include various separate environmental issues in a number of countries.
Approximately half of these were pre-existing in companies acquired by the Group. By their nature the amounts
and timing of any outflows are difficult to predict. The Group estimates that approximately half of the amount
provided for may result in cash outflows over the next five years. Significant provisions are discounted by between
5% and 6%.
Legal provisions consist mainly of the major legal cases as described in Note 7 and the vitamin case as described
in Note 11. The amounts, timing and uncertainties of any outflows are discussed in those notes, as are the
discount rates used. The remaining legal provisions, which account for less than 25% of the balance, consist of
a number of other separate legal matters in various Group companies. The majority of any cash outflows are
expected to occur within the next one to three years, although these are dependent on the development of the
various litigations. Significant provisions are discounted by between 5% and 6%.
Major legal cases are described in Note 7 and the vitamin case is described in Note 11. Other litigation matters,
which are currently not as significant, are described below.
78 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Tamiflu Development and License Agreement: On 23 June 2005 Gilead Sciences, Inc. (‘Gilead’) delivered
to the Group a notice of termination of the 1996 Development and License Agreement for Tamiflu for alleged
material breach of the agreement. On 16 November 2005 the Group and Gilead signed an amended agreement
and settlement agreement which ends the dispute. Amongst other matters, the amended agreement includes a
revised calculation for royalty payments. As part of this settlement the Group paid Gilead 81 million US dollars in
retroactive royalty adjustments. In the 2005 results, cost of sales includes all royalty costs relating to 2005 Tamiflu
sales, including retroactive adjustments paid on 16 November 2005 based on the amended agreement and
settlement agreement that relate to sales made earlier in 2005. General and administration expenses in 2005
include 39 million Swiss francs for retrospective adjustments relating to 2001–2004.
Restructuring provisions
These arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of business undertaken by the Group
or the manner in which business is conducted. Such provisions include only the costs necessarily entailed by
the restructuring which are not associated with the recurring activities of the Group. The remaining amounts
are mostly in respect of obligations towards former employees arising from the Pharmaceuticals Division
restructuring and other previous restructuring plans. The timings of these cash outflows are reasonably certain
on a global basis and are shown in the above table. Significant provisions are discounted by 4%.
Other provisions
Other provisions consist mostly of claims arising from trade and various other provisions from Group companies
that do not fit into the above categories. The timings of cash outflows are by their nature uncertain and the best
estimates are shown in the above table. Significant provisions are discounted by between 4% and 6%.
Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees, to be affected by
political, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating to environmental protection, in
the countries in which it operates. The industries in which the Group is engaged are also subject to physical risks
of various kinds. The nature and frequency of these developments and events, not all of which are covered by
insurance, as well as their effect on future operations and earnings are not predictable. See also Note 11 in
respect of the vitamin case and Note 7 in respect of major legal cases.
The Group has entered into strategic alliances with various companies in order to gain access to potential new
products or to utilise other companies to help develop the Group’s own potential new products. Potential future
payments may become due to certain collaboration partners achieving certain milestones as defined in
thecollaboration agreements. The Group’s best estimate of future commitments for such payments is 176 million
Swiss francs in 2006, 156 million Swiss francs in 2007 and 120 million Swiss francs in 2008.

The ‘LYONs’ zero coupon US dollar exchangeable notes (see below) are reflected as due the first year that the
holders of the notes can request the Group to purchase the notes.
The fair value of the debt instruments is 9.2 billion Swiss francs (2004: 6.9 billion Swiss francs) and the fair value
of total debt is 10.3 billion Swiss francs (2004: 9.4 billion Swiss francs). This is calculated based on the observable
market prices of the debt instruments or the present value of the future cash flows on the instrument, discounted
at a market rate of interest for instruments with similar credit status, cash flows and maturity periods.
There are no pledges on the Group’s assets in connection with debt.
Amounts due to banks and other financial institutions
Interest rates on these amounts, which are primarily denominated in euros, average approximately 3.0% (2004:
3.5%). Repayment dates are up to three years. 224 million Swiss francs (2004: 683 million Swiss francs) are due
within one year.

Fair Value Option
As disclosed in Note 1, in 2005 the Group applied the Fair Value Option on three of its outstanding debt
instruments on which the Group had been applying fair value hedge accounting in the past. These debt
instruments are the ‘European Medium Term Note programme’ Euro bonds, the ‘Chameleon’ US dollar bonds and
the ‘Rodeo’ Swiss franc bonds. The Fair Value Option treatment is based on the elimination of an accounting
mismatch which had been recognised between the hedging swaps (reported at fair value) and the hedged bonds
(reported at amortised cost). The difference between the carrying value and the principal amount for these debt
instruments totals 68 million Swiss francs (2004: 101 million Swiss francs).

Issues of new debt instruments
On 18 July 2005 Genentech completed a private placement of 2 billion US dollars aggregate principal amount of
Senior Notes. The placement consists of 500 million US dollars of 4.40% Senior Notes due 2010, 1 billion US dollars
of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2015 and 500 million US dollars of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2035. The Senior Notes

Repayments, redemptions and conversions of debt instruments – 2005
Redemption of ‘Sumo’ Japanese yen exchangeable bonds: On the due date of 25 March 2005 the Group
redeemed these bonds at the original issue amount plus accrued original issue discount (OID). The effective
interest rate of these bonds was 1.89%. The cash outflow was 1,178 million Swiss francs. There was no gain or
loss recorded on the redemption.
Partial conversion and repurchase of ‘LYONs V’ US dollar exchangeable notes: On 25 January 2005 the
Group repurchased at the option of the bondholders a total of 668,000 US dollars nominal value of notes for a
total consideration of 0.4 million US dollars (0.4 million Swiss francs) which was equal to the carrying value of
these notes. During 2005 a total of 200,000 notes with a carrying value of 0.1 million Swiss francs were converted
into 1,066 non-voting equity securities. The notes repurchased and called for conversion during 2005 represent
0.04% of the number of notes outstanding at the start of the year. This had no material impact on the financial
statements.
Partial conversion of ‘Series 6 Chugai Pharmaceutical Unsecured Convertible Bonds’: During 2005
bondswith a face value of 1.4 billion Japanese yen (16 million Swiss francs) were converted to shares of Chugai.
The Group’s percentage ownership in Chugai was unaffected by this conversion, as the Group has bonds
convertible into Chugai shares that mirror those that Chugai has outstanding with third parties.
Repayments, redemptions and conversions of debt instruments – 2004
During 2004 the Group has converted or redeemed certain of its debt instruments. Debt was reduced by
4,026 million Swiss francs, the total cash outflow was 3,039 million Swiss francs and a net pre-tax gain of
872 million Swiss francs resulted as shown in Note 9. This net gain is reported as an exceptional item due to
itsmateriality. These transactions are described below.
Conversion and redemption of ‘LYONs IV’ US dollar exchangeable notes: On 3 March 2004 the Group
exercised its option to call these notes for redemption on 5 April 2004 at the original issue amount plus accrued
original issue discount (OID). The effective interest rate of these notes was 4.26%. In the period to 5 April 2004
notes with a principal amount of 1,506 million US dollars were called for conversion by the holders and the
remaining notes were redeemed for cash on 5 April 2004. As a result of the conversion the Group’s ownership of
Genentech decreased by 2.45% and the Group realised a pre-tax gain of 1,136 million Swiss francs on the part
disposal of its interest in Genentech and redemption of the remaining notes.
Redemption of ‘LYONs III’ US dollar exchangeable notes: On 5 April 2004 the Group exercised its option to
call these notes for redemption on 6 May 2004 at the original issue amount plus accrued original issue discount (OID).
The effective interest rate of these notes was 6.91%. Notes with a principal amount of 3 billion US dollars were
redeemed for cash. The Group realised a pre-tax loss of 96 million Swiss francs on the early redemption of the notes.
82 Finance Report 2005Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Partial redemption of ‘Chameleon’ US dollar bonds: On 3 June 2004 the Group announced a tender offer for
the redemption of the ‘Chameleon’ bond. The effective interest rate of these bonds was 6.77%. The tender offer
expired on 23 June 2004 and pricing was on 24 June 2004, at which point bonds with a principal amount of
513 million US dollars, representing approximately 51.25% of the outstanding bonds, had been tendered for
redemption. Settlement was made on 29 June 2004. The Group realised a pre-tax loss of 74 million Swiss francs
on the partial early redemption of these bonds.
Redemption of Limited Conversion Preferred Stock: On the mandatory redemption date of 11 November
2004 the Group redeemed the remaining instruments at the original issue amount plus accrued interest. The
effective interest rate of these instruments was 3.00%. Instruments with a principal amount of 2 million US dollars
were redeemed for cash. The Group did not realise any gain or loss on the redemption.
Reassessment of probable redemption date of ‘LYONs V’ US dollar exchangeable notes: Effective
30 September 2004 the Group reassessed the likely future cash outflows for this instrument and concluded it
wasappropriate to consider the first call date of 25 July 2007 as the most probable date of cash flows. Accordingly,
using the effective interest rate method, the Group recorded a pre-tax expense of 94 million Swiss francs and
an increase in debt of the same amount. This reflects an increase in the carrying value of the debt to allow the
accreted value to meet the issue price plus accrued original issue discount (OID) at 25 July 2007. There was no
cash effect in 2004.
Partial conversion of ‘Series 6 Chugai Pharmaceutical Unsecured Convertible Bonds’: During 2004 bonds
with a face value of 1.6 billion Japanese yen (18 million Swiss francs) were converted to shares of Chugai. The
Group’s percentage ownership in Chugai was unaffected by this conversion, as the Group has bonds convertible
into Chugai shares that mirror those that Chugai has outstanding with third parties.

Terms of outstanding convertible debt instruments
‘LYONs V’: The notes are exchangeable for Non-voting Equity Securities (NES) or American Depositary Shares
(ADS) at an exchange ratio of 5.33901 NES or 10.67802 exchange ADSs per USD 1,000 principal amount at
maturity of the notes. The Group will purchase any note for cash, at the option of the holder, on 25 July 2007,
25July 2011 and 25 July 2016 for a purchase price per USD 1,000 principal amount of the notes of USD 604.74,
USD 698.20 and USD 835.58, respectively. In addition, the notes will be redeemable at the option of the Group in
whole or in part at any time after 25 July 2007 at the issue price plus accrued original issue discount (OID). If the
notes outstanding at 31 December 2005 were all exchanged it would require 10,947,634 non-voting equity
securities to meet the obligation.
‘Series 6 Chugai Pharmaceutical Unsecured Convertible Bonds’: Each bond of JPY 1,000,000 par value is
convertible for 1,311 shares of Chugai. Conversion is at the option of the bondholder and may be made at any time
up to the due date of 30 September 2008. The bonds will be redeemable at maturity at the issue price. If the bonds
outstanding at 31 December 2005 were all converted it would require 586,229 Chugai shares to exactly meet the
obligation. The Group’s percentage ownership in Chugai would not be affected by any conversion, as the Group
has bonds convertible into Chugai shares that mirror those that Chugai has outstanding with third parties.

Share capital
As of 31 December 2005, the share capital of Roche Holding Ltd, which is the Group’s parent company, consisted
of 160,000,000 shares with a nominal value of 1.00 Swiss franc each, as in the preceding year. The shares are
bearer shares and the Group does not maintain a register of shareholders. Based on information supplied to the

32. Earnings per share and non-voting equity security
Basic earnings per share and non-voting equity security
For the calculation of basic earnings per share and non-voting equity security, the number of shares and non-
voting equity securities is reduced by the weighted average number of its own non-voting equity securities held
by the Group during the period.

Diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security, the net income and weighted
average number of shares and non-voting equity securities outstanding are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive
potential shares and non-voting equity securities.
Potential dilutive effects arise from the convertible debt instruments and the employee stock option plans.
If the outstanding convertible debt instruments were to be converted this would lead to a reduction in interest
expense and an increase in the number of shares which may have a net dilutive effect on the earnings per
share. The exercise of outstanding vested employee stock options would have a dilutive effect. The exercise
of the outstanding vested Genentech employee stock options would have a dilutive effect if the net income of
Genentech is positive. The diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security reflects the potential impacts
of these dilutive effects on the earnings per share figures.

Cash flows from operating activities arise from the Group’s primary activities in the Pharmaceuticals and
Diagnostics businesses. These are calculated by the indirect method, adjusting the Group’s operating profit
for any operating income and expenses that are not cash flows (for example depreciation, amortisation and
impairment) in order to derive the cash generated from operations. This and other operating cash flows are shown
in the cash flow statement. Operating cash flows also include income taxes paid on all activities, including,
forexample, the taxes paid on the income from bond conversion and redemption.

Share capital

participate in the available earnings and in any remaining proceeds from liquidation following repayment of the
share capital.

00_L_Roche_AR09_ENG_Key figuresindd 1 29012010 14:20:10The year 2009 in brief
Group
• Group sales increase by 10% 1 to 49.1 billion Swiss francs (8% in Swiss francs; 7% in US dollars).
Both divisions gain market share.
• Operating profit before exceptional items increases by 14% (8% in Swiss francs) to 15.0 billion
Swiss francs due to strong sales growth and continuing productivity improvements; at the same time
investments in research and development increase by 12% to 9.9 billion Swiss francs.
• Effective 26 March 2009, Roche obtains full ownership of Genentech for a price of 47.0 billion US dollars,
or 52.7 billion Swiss francs. Genentech integration has been completed.
• Net income of 8.5 billion Swiss francs, down by 22% compared with the previous year due to exceptional
items relating to the Genentech transaction and integration.
• Excluding exceptional items, the Genentech transaction is already contributing to income:
income attributable to Roche shareholders increases by 9% to 9.8 billion Swiss francs.
• Core EPS at constant exchange rates 20% above 2008 (10% in Swiss francs).
• Board proposes a dividend increase of 20% to 6.00 Swiss francs, the 23rd consecutive year of
dividend growth; this would increase the payout ratio to 53%.
Pharmaceuticals
• Pharma sales grow by 11% (8% in Swiss francs; 8% in US dollars), almost twice the global market
growth rate, driven by leading cancer medications and Tamiflu (influenza medicine) as well as Lucentis
(ophthalmology medicine).
• Tamiflu sales grow sharply to 3.2 billion Swiss francs following substantially increased demand during
the pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (‘swine flu’) outbreak.
• Operating profit margin before exceptional items increases 1.2 percentage points at constant exchange
rates (+0.2 percentage points in Swiss francs).
• Strong R&D pipeline with ten new molecular entities in late-stage clinical testing; six new compounds
entered phase III clinical trials in 2009.
• Actemra approved in US for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in January 2010.
Diagnostics
• Sales increase by 9% (4% in Swiss francs and 4% in US dollars) to 10.1 billion Swiss francs, more than
twice the market growth rate.
• Operating profit margin at constant exchange rates increases 0.4 percentage points (–0.4 percentage points
in Swiss francs).
Outlook
• Full-year 2010 sales for Pharmaceuticals and the Group expected to grow in the mid-single-digit range 2.
• Expected decrease of Tamiflu sales from 3.2 to 1.2 billion Swiss francs.
• Diagnostics sales expected to grow well ahead of market.
• Planned research and development expenses will decline slightly in 2010 compared to 2009.
• Roche confirms target of double-digit Core Earnings per Share growth 3 in 2010.
• Based on the strong operating free cash flow, Roche expects to reduce debt progressively and to return
to a net cash position by 2015 while maintaining its attractive dividend policy.
1 Unless otherwise stated, all growth rates are in local currencies.
2 Without Tamiflu sales.
3 At constant exchange rates.

for aggressive brain tumours
Roche is tackling some of modern medicine’s greatest challenges in its search for medicines to combat
serious illnesses for which no effective treatment exists. It’s a quest that requires both sophisticated
technological capabilities and deep insights into molecular biology. To select optimal targets for drug
treatment, you first need to understand the complex biological mechanisms driving a disease. In the
case of Avastin, the targeted blockade of a blood-vessel growth factor — an approach first developed
by Genentech scientists — starves tumours of the nutrients and oxygen they need to grow and spread.
This has fundamentally changed the way we fight cancer. Avastin is currently approved to treat five types
of cancer and is being investigated as a possible treatment in over 30 different tumour types, giving
hope to thousands of patients.
Avastin is a monoclonal antibody used to treat advanced colorectal, breast,
non-small cell lung and kidney cancer. In 2009 it was also approved in the
US and eleven other countries for the treatment of relapsed glioblastoma
multiforme, the most aggressive type of brain tumour.
04_Bildstrecke_ENG_S08-09indd 2 28012010 23:35:32Roche Group | Very strong operating
performance in 2009. Group sales, ope­
rating profit (before exceptional items) and
Core Earnings per Share increased by
double digits. Roche anticipates another
double­digit rise in Core EPS in 2010.
The Group remains firmly focused on
prescription drugs and in vitro diagnostics.
Following the successful integration of
Genentech, Roche is better equipped than
ever to be a healthcare innovator.

for a new drug for
rheumatoid arthritis
Searching for a safe and effective new medicine is like looking for
a needle in a haystack: only one in many thousands of potential
candidates ever completes the journey from idea to pharmacy shelf.
Because we know that a diversity of approaches produces prom -
ising ideas faster, Roche has built a unique innovation network of
independent research and development (R & D) centres. In add i -
tion to Roche’s pharmaceutical and diagnostic R & D units, it
com prises Genentech Research and Early Development in the US
and Chugai R & D laboratories in Japan, as well as alliances with
around 150 partners worldwide. One of the most recent products
of successful collaboration of this kind is Actemra/RoActemra, a
biological medicine with a new target for use in patients with rheu-
matoid arthritis. Discovered by Chugai and codeveloped with
Roche, Actemra/RoActemra is now being made available to patients
all over the world thanks to the global reach of the Roche Group.
Actemra/RoActemra is a first-in-class monoclonal
antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It
binds to the interleukin-6 receptor and blocks
the effects of the signalling protein IL-6, a key driver
of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.
06_Bildstrecke_ENG_S18-19indd 2 28012010 23:28:15Pharmaceuticals | In 2009 demand
for key medicines and efficiency gains
resulted in double-digit increases in sales
and operating profit. Thirteen major
marketing approvals and positive results
from 16 phase III clinical trials confirmed
the division’s growth potential. The
Pharmaceuticals Division is focused on
translating excellence in science into
effective medicines for patients. It combines
cutting-edge research at Roche, Genentech
in the US, Chugai in Japan and over
150 partners worldwide with global scale
and reach in clinical development,
manufacturing and commercial operations.

Excellence in science:
A unique diversity of approaches

Partners
Understanding the complex biology of disease is the biggest challenge we face in developing
new and better medicines and diagnostics. Scientific breakthroughs are most likely to occur
when scientists are free to tackle problems from different angles and in different ways.
Our scientists have this freedom. We believe that a diversity of views, cultures and approaches
promotes creativity, especially in research and early development. Our own autonomous
research and development hubs, augmented by over 150 alliances, provide a natural climate
for innovation.

Discovering, developing and commercialising new medicines takes time and vision. To stay
at the leading edge of innovation, it is essential to invest early in promising new technologies.
We were one of the first pharmaceutical companies to embrace biotechnology, which led to
our acquiring a majority stake in Genentech in 1990. Today our biotech products are helping to
improve the lives of countless patients in a variety of disease areas, and we are the number-
one maker of biologics. We also invested in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology when
it was still in its infancy — a decision which has helped us to become the global market
leader in molecular diagnostics.
One of the technologies we are investing in today is RNA interference (RNAi), which offers
a way to target and ‘turn off’ specific genes. RNAi-based medicines could prove a ground-
breaking new approach to fighting disease and helping patients.

Excellence in science:
Seamless collaboration

Process
As a leading healthcare company with strengths in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics, we are
well equipped to advance personalised healthcare. The organisational realignment imple-
mented in our Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics Divisions over the last several years enables
them to collaborate seamlessly along the whole value chain, from discovery to commerciali-
sation. This is particularly important since personalised healthcare starts early in the drug
development process. Our Diagnostics Division is there from the beginning, with technologies
and expertise to help identify potential drug targets, screen out less-promising candidate
compounds and select suitable patients for clinical trials. In some cases collaboration results
in a drug coupled with a companion diagnostic to guide treatment.

07_L_Roche_AR09_ENG_Pharmaceuticalsindd 43 29012010 12:4709Together they’re taking aim
with an innovative medicine
for skin cancer
Roche is not only the world leader in in vitro diagnostics. We also syste m ­
atically apply our diagnostic expertise to the research and development
of new medicines. This helps us to develop pharmaceuticals that target
the biological mechanisms that give rise to cancer. One example is
RG7204 (PLX4032), currently being tested in phase II clinical trials as
a possible treatment for malignant melanoma, a type of skin cancer.
RG7204 is a novel, highly selective BRAF kinase inhibitor that targets and
destroys cancer cells harbouring a specific cancer causing gene mutation
called BRAF V600E. To identify those patients whose tumours carry this
mutation — and are therefore considered most likely to respond to this
targeted medicine — Roche is developing a companion diagnostic test.
RG7204 is a promising compound in development
for the treatment of BRAF mutation­positive patients
with malignant melanomas, the deadliest form of
skin cancer. This oral medicine — a selective kinase
inhibitor — is being developed by Roche in
collaboration with Plexxikon.

grew well ahead of the market, with strong
uptake of new products contributing to
market share gains in key segments such
as immunoassays and tissue diagnostics.
All business areas launched major new
products that Roche believes will help drive
above-market growth in 2010. Efforts to
enhance operational efficiency are
ongoing throughout the division and
contributed to higher operating profit in
2009. The division will continue and
expand these efforts in order to improve
productivity and profitability further.

Roche Business Report 2009 Diagnostics
Excellence in science:
Expertise in molecular biology
5
Major disease areas
Over the years both Roche divisions have amassed tremendous expertise in molecular biology.
Today they are applying this knowledge and a wide range of technologies in the pursuit
of new tests and more targeted treatments in five major focus areas: oncology, inflammation,
neuroscience, metabolism and virology. At the same time they are working together to
gain further insights into molecular mechanisms that cause and drive disease. Every cancer
drug development programme at Roche, for example, involves biomarker research aimed
at validating treatment targets and identifying the patients most likely to respond to a new
drug. Almost 30 years of cancer research at the molecular level have helped us develop
new strategies that move us closer to the ultimate goal of one day curing cancer.

09_L_Roche_AR09_ENG_Diagnosticsindd 61 29012010 01:58:44They’re reading genes
to help save lives one day
Precision and speed count in modern molecular diagnostics. We’re working to improve both. Our
genome sequencers can ‘read’ the building blocks of highly variable genes in a matter of days instead
of weeks, which is how long it takes to achieve the same precision with conventional sequencing
methods. This may one day help to extend and improve the lives of transplant patients. Currently
we are investigating the use of our sequencers for HLA (human leukocyte antigen) genotyping of blood
stem cells. Stem cell transplantation is performed to treat a number of diseases, including leukemia.
Donors’ and recipients’ cells need to be as HLA-compatible as possible for treatment to be successful.
Studies have shown that the Genome Sequencer FLX System * is a power-
ful research tool for high-resolution HLA genotyping, which is critical for people
needing transplants. The closer the match between the donor’s and recipient’s
HLA genes, the smaller the risk of transplant rejection.
* For life science research only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.

PSP 2008–2010 and 2009–2011: Estimated value calculated using the year-end price as of 31 December 2009, CHF 175.80 per non-
voting equity security (NES), based on the number of NES originally targeted subject to changes in the number and value of NES
awardable under the plan on 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2011, respectively, and spread over the relevant period of time,
i.e. ¹⁄³ for the year 2009. The Board of Directors will vote on the actual allocation of NES originally targeted on 31 December 2010 and
31 December 2011, respectively, according to the TSR achieved.

12_L_Roche_AR09_ENG_Remuneration Reportindd 85 29012010 00:5059He’s sharpening his weapons
for the fight against
advanced breast cancer
When biotechnology was in its infancy thirty years ago, nobody would
have guessed that it would one day give rise to a completely new
class of powerful, targeted medicines: monoclonal antibodies (MAbs).
Today, MAbs are being used successfully not only in the fight
against cancer but also to treat rheumatoid arthritis. It took courage,
skilful management and long-term commitment to enable Roche to
invest in this technology at such an early stage. The skill and dedication
of our people was vital in transforming MAbs into a medical and
business success story. Today, around two thirds of all Roche drugs are
based on biotechnology, and a new approach — joining MAbs with
chemotherapy — promises to make the treatment of cancer even more
targeted, with fewer side effects.
T-DM1 is a novel antibody-drug conjugate that combines
two anti-tumour strategies in one medicine: the directed
binding of a monoclonal antibody to a highly expressed
cancer protein, leading to the targeted delivery of a potent
chemotherapy agent. This selectively kills cancer cells and
minimises damage to healthy tissue.

Finance — 2009 in brief
Sales
• Group sales increased by 10% in local currencies to 49.1 billion Swiss francs. Excluding Tamiflu sales
theincrease was 5% in local currencies.
• Pharmaceuticals sales increased by 11% in local currencies or 3.0 billion Swiss francs, almost twice the
globalmarket growth thanks to virology, in particular Tamiflu, the key oncology products and Lucentis
inophthalmology. This was achieved in spite of the reduction in CellCept sales due to the patent expiry in
theUnited States.
• Tamiflu sales grew sharply by 2.6 billion Swiss francs to 3.2 billion Swiss francs driven by the current
pandemicA (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus (‘swine flu’) outbreak.
• Diagnostics sales increased by 9% in local currencies to 10.1 billion Swiss francs, driven by sales growth in
Professional Diagnostics and Diabetes Care. This was more than twice the estimated IVD market growth rate.
Operating results
• Operating profit before exceptional items increased by 14% in local currencies to 15.0 billion Swiss francs
thanks to strong sales growth and continuing productivity improvements, which more than covered increased
investments in research and development.
• Operating profit margin before exceptional items and at constant exchange rates increased by 1.0 percentage
points, with increases of 1.2 percentage points in the Pharmaceuticals Division and 0.4 percentage points
intheDiagnostics Division. Exchange rates had an unfavourable impact of approximately 1 percentage point
onGroup, Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics margins.
• Research and development expenditure increased 12% in local currencies to 9.9 billion Swiss francs,
representing 20.1% of Group sales, due mainly to continued investment in the strong late-stage pipeline.
• Effective 26 March 2009 Roche obtained full ownership of Genentech for a total cash consideration of 47.0bil-
lion US dollars or 52.7 billion Swiss francs. Exceptional restructuring costs of 2.4 billion Swiss francs were
incurred in respect of the integration of Genentech and related restructuring in the Pharmaceuticals Division,
notably of manufacturing operations.
Treasury
• As a consequence of the Genentech transaction, the Group’s treasury results changed significantly
during2009, with the net financial result being an expense of 1.7 billion Swiss francs, primarily driven
bythehigher interest expenses.
• Of the 48.2 billion Swiss francs bond and notes issued in early 2009 to finance the Genentech transaction,
6.9billion Swiss francs already repaid in the second half of 2009.
Financial condition
• Strong financial condition with free cash flow of 8.9 billion Swiss francs, up 79% from 2008.
• Swing of 40.6 billion Swiss francs from a net cash position of 16.7 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2008
toa net debt position of 23.9 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2009 to finance the Genentech transaction.
• Following the Genentech transaction Moody’s lowered Roche’s rating to A2 from Aa1 and Standard &Poor’s
lowered Roche’s rating to AA– from AA+.
Net income and Core EPS
• Net income decreased by 22% to 8.5 billion Swiss francs, primarily driven by the exceptional items relating
tothe Genentech transaction and the restructuring of the Pharmaceuticals manufacturing operations. Diluted
EPS decreased by 12%, less than the decrease in net income due to the positive impact of 100% ownership
ofGenentech.
• The Genentech transaction was accretive with net income attributable to Roche shareholders (before
exceptional items) increasing 9% to 9.8 billion Swiss francs.
• Core EPS was 20% higher at constant exchange rates and 10% higher in Swiss francs.
Shareholder return
• Increase in Total Shareholder Return (TSR), i.e. share price growth plus dividends, of +12% combined
performance of share and non-voting equity security.
• Increase in proposed dividend of 20% to 6.00 Swiss francs, representing the 23rdconsecutive year
of dividend growth.
• If approved by shareholders, this will result in an increased payout ratio of 53% and a higher dividend yield
onRoche shares of 3.3% and on non-voting equity securities of 3.4%, based on year-end prices.4

In 2009 the Group continued its strong operating performance from previous years with a significant positive
contribution from increased Tamiflu sales. The Group maintained the planned investments in research and
development and completed the transaction to take full ownership at Genentech while making significant
progress on the related integration and restructuring activities. Total sales grew by 10% in local currencies
(8% in Swiss francs; 7% in US dollars) to 49.1 billion Swiss francs, with the Pharmaceuticals Division
representing 80% of Group sales and the Diagnostics Division contributing 20%. Demand for medicines
fromthe Group’s oncology franchise remained strong with Avastin, Herceptin, MabThera/Rituxan, Tarceva
andXeloda all contributing to an overall 8% growth. Additional major growth drivers in the Pharmaceuticals
Division were Tamiflu in virology and Lucentis in ophthalmology. Mircera showed steady sales development
inWestern Europe and Actemra/RoActemra continued with strong growth in Japan and was launched in
several countries in Western Europe and in other markets. These positive factors offset the reduction in sales
following expiry of the US patent for CellCept. In the Diagnostics Division the main growth areas were
Professional Diagnostics and Diabetes Care. Tissue Diagnostics continued to show strong sales increases.
Sales growth in both divisions exceeded market growth.
The Group’s operating profit before exceptional items increased by 14% in local currencies (8% in Swiss
francs), well above sales growth of 10%, reflecting the Group’s focus on cost management as well as top line
growth. The Pharmaceuticals Division increased its operating profit before exceptional items by 15% in local
currencies, driven by strong sales growth of 11% combined with overall under-proportionate growth in costs.
Research and development expenses grew by 13% in local currencies, reflecting investment in the Group’s
strong late-stage pipeline, including promising compounds such as dalcetrapib, taspoglutide, pertuzumab and
T-DM1. The rise in R&D expenses was also driven by higher impairments of intangible assets. At 302 million
Swiss francs, these were 203 million Swiss francs higher than in 2008, primarily as a result of recent clinical
data, technology assessments and portfolio prioritisation decisions. Operating profit growth in the Diagnostics
Division was 12% in local currencies, with the main factors being sales growth, tight cost management
andthe absence of the accounting impact of last year’s acquisition of Ventana. At constant exchange rates,
the Group’s operating profit margin before exceptional items increased by 1.0 percentage points, with the
Pharmaceuticals Division improving by 1.2 percentage points and the Diagnostics Division by 0.4 percentage
points. When translated into Swiss francs however, the Group’s operating profit margin before exceptional
items increased only slightly by 0.1 percentage points to 30.6%, due to a particularly unfavourable combina-
tion of exchange rate movements (see tables and further analysis on pages 18—19).5
The Group’s operating free cash flow increased strongly by 34% in local currencies (27% in Swiss francs)
to15.7 billion Swiss francs following the improved results of the business and the absence in 2009 of the net
cash outflows associated with Genentech’s stock option plans in 2008.
The Pharmaceuticals Division incurred exceptional operating expenses of 2.4 billion Swiss francs relating
tothe Genentech transaction and the restructuring of the Pharmaceuticals Division, notably in manufacturing
operations. There was also an increase in provisions for major legal cases. The comparative period
containedexceptional operating income of 271 million Swiss francs from litigation settlement at Genentech
and expenses of 243 million Swiss francs from the initial stages of Pharmaceuticals Division reorganisation.
This swing of 2.8 billion Swiss francs in exceptional items in total led to a decline of the Group’s operating
profit of 12% in Swiss francs and 5% in local currencies. Non-cash items account for 1.8 billion Swiss
francsof the exceptional operating expenses, relating mainly to the impairments of manufacturing sites
announced in the first half of 2009.

Pharmaceuticals operating results
The Pharmaceuticals Division increased its sales by 11% in local currencies (8% in Swiss francs; 8% in
USdollars) to 39.0 billion Swiss francs, almost double the global market growth. Operating profit before
exceptional items was 14.2 billion Swiss francs. At constant exchange rates, the operating profit margin
increased by 1.2 percentage points due to sales growth and overall lower cost growth, in spite of significantly
increased research and development expenses, including impairment charges, and lower gains from product
disposals. When translated in Swiss francs however, the margin increased only by 0.2 percentage points
to36.3%, due to a particularly unfavourable combination of exchange rate movements (see tables and further
analysis on pages 18—19). At constant exchange rates, in the first half of 2009 the margin increased by
2.9percentage points year-on-year, followed by a reduction of 0.3 percentage points in the second half of
2009. This reduction was primarily driven by accelerated R&D growth including impairments of intangible
assets in the second half, which accounted for a negative swing of 1.5 percentage points.6
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Financial Review
Marketing costs increased only moderately in local currencies while still promoting the growing oncology
and rheumatoid arthritis portfolios. Investments were made in broader indications, particularly for Avastin,
aswell as for the launch of Actemra/RoActemra in Western Europe and some other countries. The strong
increase in research and development expenses, significantly above the increase in sales, was due to
continued high investments in the strong pipeline and expanded portfolio, the large number of late-stage
clinical trials and impairment of intangible assets.
For more information on the divisional business and its pipeline, see the Business Report (Part 1 of this
Annual Report).

The major growth drivers were strong Tamiflu sales in the virology therapeutic area, key products in oncology
and Lucentis in ophthalmology. Sales in the renal anemia therapeutic area remained stable in an increasingly
competitive, cost-sensitive market. Sales in inflammation/autoimmune/transplantation declined by 6% due
tothe expected negative impact of the CellCept patent expiry in the United States. This was partly offset by
the continued success of MabThera/Rituxan in rheumatoid arthritis and also by continued strong growth
ofActemra/RoActemra in Japan and, post-launch, in several markets of Western Europe and elsewhere.
Salesin the metabolism/bone portfolio declined by 4%, mainly due to lower Bonviva/Boniva sales in the US
following generic competition and a decline in the bisphosphonate market.

In 2009 the Top 20 Pharmaceuticals products, which represented 88% of the Pharmaceuticals portfolio,
grew14% with the majority of products showing sales growth. Besides Tamiflu, the local sales growth of the
Pharmaceuticals Division was primarily came from eight products: Avastin, Herceptin, MabThera/Rituxan,
Lucentis, Mircera, Tarceva, Activase/TNKase and Actemra/RoActemra. These eight products represent 53%
ofthe portfolio (2008: 52%; 2007: 46%) and together generated over 2.0 billion Swiss francs of additional
sales compared to 2008. Sales of CellCept declined due to the patent expiry in the United States in May
2009. Other sales declines were primarily due to generic erosion following patent expiry, strong competition
in certain franchises and product disposals as well as the voluntary withdrawal of Raptiva in the US. These
were partly compensated for by steady growth and launch impacts of Mircera and Actemra/RoActemra.7

1) Inflammation/Autoimmune/Transplantation.
Avastin | Sales rose 21% to 6.2 billion Swiss francs in 2009. Sustained growth in all regions was driven
primarily by continued uptake in colorectal, breast and lung cancer. In the United States sales growth came
mainly from use in advanced breast cancer and the new indications in glioblastoma and kidney cancer,
whilehigh penetration rates were maintained in established indications such as lung and colorectal cancer.
Sales in Japan (+74%), where Avastin is approved for advanced colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer,
remain particularly strong.
MabThera/Rituxan | Overall sales rose 6% to 6.1 billion Swiss francs. Growth in the oncology segment
wasdriven by the uptake in chronic lymphocytic leukemia following approvals in the EU during the year.
Lower sales growth in the US (3%) reflects the high levels of adoption in the product’s cancer indications.
Increased sales in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) segment are due to increasing and earlier use of MabThera/
Rituxan in patients with an inadequate response to one or more tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors.
MabThera/Rituxan is well established as the medicine of choice following the inadequate response to TNF
inhibitor treatment and is currently the market leader in that segment in the EU. An estimated 900 million
Swiss francs of sales were generated in the RA indication, representing 15% of overall product sales.
Herceptin | Sales of Herceptin increased 8% to 5.3 billion Swiss francs in 2009, driven by continued uptake
in early breast cancer, especially in Japan (+25%) and a number of emerging markets as well as increasing
market penetration in Eastern Europe. Moderate sales growth in the US and Western Europe reflects the high
market penetration achieved in both early and advanced breast cancer in these regions.8
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Financial Review
Tamiflu | Global sales of the anti-influenza medicine Tamiflu totalled 3.2 billion Swiss francs in 2009,
anincrease of 2.6 billion Swiss francs, or over 400%, on last year. This very high growth was driven by
unprecedented demand from governments and in the retail pharmacy sector following the pandemic
A(H1N1) 2009 influenza virus (‘swine flu’) outbreak, which began in April 2009 and spread rapidly across
theworld. Sales for pandemic stockpiling amounted to 1.9 billion Swiss francs. Roche is co-operating closely
with the World Health Organization and governments worldwide to support pandemic preparedness and
supply Tamiflu to all patients in need.
Pegasys | In 2009 sales of Pegasys rose 5% to 1.7 billion Swiss francs. Growth was driven by market-share
gains in major markets.
CellCept | Sales of CellCept for the prevention of solid organ transplant rejection decreased 22% compared
with 2008 to 1.6 billion Swiss francs. As expected, sales in the United States, the product’s largest market,
fellsharply year-on-year after the first quarter as a result of the expiry of the product’s US patent in May 2009.
The continuing erosion of US sales through generic competition is being offset to some extent bycontinued
solid growth elsewhere, particularly in Latin America and Japan.
NeoRecormon/Epogin | Combined sales of Roche’s NeoRecormon and Chugai’s Epogin (epoetin beta)
weredown 11% compared to 2008. The decline in NeoRecormon sales of 14%, primarily driven by Western
Europe, was mainly due to increased price pressure as new biosimilars enter the market. The slight decline
insales of Epogin in Japan (down 1%) reflects stabilisation of the product’s market share in the dialysis
segment and continued expansion in the predialysis setting.
Tarceva | Sales increased by 10% reflecting the growing use of the medicine in second-line non-small cell
lung cancer outside the US and in metastatic pancreatic cancer, with the main sales contributions coming
from the United States and Western Europe. The more modest growth in US sales reflects stable penetration
in NSCLC and pancreatic cancer, the competitive environment and reserve adjustments taken during the
yearfor government programmes involving discounts.
Xeloda | Overall sales rose 7% to 1.3 billion Swiss francs coming primarily from growth in the United
States,Japan and China. Growth came from the use of the medicine in metastatic breast cancer, adjuvant
colon cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer.
Lucentis | US sales of Lucentis, for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), increased 24% to
1.2 billion Swiss francs compared to 2008. Strong growth was driven primarily by an increase in the number
ofinjections administered to patients in the first and second years of treatment, growth in the number
ofpatients treated for wet AMD and easier reimbursement.
Bonviva/Boniva | In a highly competitive market, sales of Bonviva/Boniva (ibandronic acid) for the treatment
of postmenopausal osteoporosis declined by 2% compared to 2008. The decline was driven by the US,
down16% due to generic competition and a decline in the bisphosphonate market. Sales in the Western
Europe and International (Asia—Pacific, CEMAI, Latin America, Canada and Others) regions increased
by12%and 33% respectively.
Mircera | In a highly competitive, price-sensitive market, sales of the renal anemia medication Mircera showed
consistent growth throughout 2009, rising 252% to 179 million Swiss francs. Sales growth was due primarily
tothe success of the product in the predialysis segment.
Actemra/RoActemra | Following EU marketing approval in January 2009 of the novel rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) medicine RoActemra (known as Actemra outside Europe), by the end of the year the medicine had been
launched in ten EU countries, including Germany, France, Spain and the United Kingdom. Sales uptake in the
initial European launch markets has been strong. Launches also took place in additional markets, including
Switzerland, India and Brazil. Global sales rose 289% to 146 million Swiss francs. In Japan, where Actemra
hasbeen approved for RA in adults and for related pediatric indications since April 2008, adoption and
market penetration are progressing well, with doctors already prescribing the medicine as a first-line biologic
treatment for many patients. Sales in Japan amounted to 98 million Swiss francs, an increase of 146%.9
See the Business Report (Part 1 of this Annual Report) for more information on Roche’s pharmaceutical
products.
Sales by region | Sales continued to grow across all regions. Growth in the United States was 5%, in line
with local market growth, with the success of the oncology products, Tamiflu and Lucentis, covering for
thepatent expiry of CellCept, the voluntary withdrawal of Raptiva, and reductions in sales of Bonviva/Boniva
due to pricing pressure caused by increased competition. The Pharmaceuticals Division continued to gain
market share in the Western Europe, CEMAI and Asia—Pacific regions, driven by further strong sales growth
ofTamiflu, Avastin, Herceptin, MabThera/Rituxan, Mircera, Tarceva, Bonviva/Boniva and Pegasys. Sales in
Japan increased strongly due to high Tamiflu sales, as well as the success of Avastin, Herceptin and Actemra
which more than compensated for lower Neutrogin sales. Total Tamiflu sales increased strongly, particularly
inWestern Europe, Japan and other markets, due to government and corporate pandemic stockpiling.
Therewere also higher seasonal sales resulting from increased demand following pandemic A (H1N1) 2009
influenza virus cases in many countries.

Operating results
Royalties and other operating income | The decline of 200 million Swiss francs or 10% in local currencies
was in particular due to 268 million Swiss francs lower gains on disposal of products, which were only partly
offset by higher royalty income and income from out-licensing agreements. The decline in gains from disposal
of products was mainly due to some significant product disposals in 2008 totalling 494 million Swiss francs,
notably for Meda and Actavis. Gains from disposal of products in 2009 of 226 million Swiss francs are all
partof the continuous realignment of the product portfolio and mainly relate to the divestment of some tail
products in Latin America. The increase in out-licensing income was mainly driven by two significant milestone
payments from GlaxoSmithKline, one for 84 million Swiss francs related to orlistat OTC approval by the EU
and the other one for 81 million Swiss francs for Bonviva/Boniva. Royalties and other operating income as
percentage of sales decreased by 1.0 percentage points to 5.0%.

Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Financial Review
Cost of sales | Costs increased by 6% in local currencies driven by a 11% rise in manufacturing cost of
goods sold and period costs. This increase was in line with sales growth, with efficiency gains in production
offsetting unfavourable product mix impacts and an inventory write-off of 141 million Swiss francs following
the voluntary withdrawal of Raptiva from the US market. Royalty expenses increased by 13% to 2,331 million
Swiss francs (2008: 2,105 million Swiss francs) mainly due to royalty expenses on higher Tamiflu sales.
Expenses for collaboration and profit-sharing agreements increased by 2% in local currencies mainly due
to Genentech’s payments of 1,417 million Swiss francs (2008: 1,330 million Swiss francs) to Biogen Idec,
Novartis and OSI in respect of MabThera/Rituxan, Xolair and Tarceva. The expenses for the profit-sharing
arrangement with GlaxoSmithKline decreased by 12% in local currencies due to lower Bonviva/Boniva
salesinthe United States and reached 407 million Swiss francs (2008: 462 million Swiss francs). Amortisation
of intangible assets decreased by 55% in local currencies as some intangible assets became fully amortised
during 2009. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased by 0.5 percentage points to 24.4% (2008:
24.9%).

Marketing and distribution | Costs increased moderately by 6% in local currencies and reached 7.0 billion
Swiss francs (2008: 6.7 billion Swiss francs) with the focus on the oncology portfolio and the rollout of
additional approved indications of Avastin. High levels of investment continued in Pegasys and there were
launches of Actemra/RoActemra in rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally further investments were focussed
onemerging markets. Marketing and distribution costs as a percentage of sales decreased by 0.7percentage
points to 17.9% (2008: 18.6%).
Research and development | The significant increase of 13% in local currencies to 8.9 billion Swiss francs
reflects investment in Roche’s strong later-stage pipeline, including promising compounds such as dalcetrapib
(CETP inhibitor for dyslipidemia), taspoglutide (GLP-1 analogue for type 2 diabetes), pertuzumab and T-DM1
(both for HER2-positive breast cancer). Moreover impairments of intangible assets increased by 203 million
Swiss francs compared to the comparative period. The 302 million Swiss francs impairment of intangible
assets, 0.8 percent of sales, relates primarily to decisions to discontinue projects due to recent clinical data,
technology assessments and portfolio prioritisation. Research and development costs as a percentage
ofsales were 22.8% compared to 22.0% in 2008 and 21.2% in the first half of 2009. The division spent
196million Swiss francs on the in-licensing of pipeline compounds and technologies, which are capitalised
asintangible assets as required by IFRS. Excluding impairment and amortisation charges, the division
spent 8.8 billion Swiss francs on internal and purchased R&D from in-licensing and other alliance deals,
representing 22.5% of sales. In addition a further 48 million Swiss francs was spent on the acquisition
ofMemory Pharmaceuticals.11

Exceptional items
Major legal cases | Provisions for major legal cases increased by 320 million Swiss francs, based on
management’s current estimates of the ultimate liabilities that are expected to arise, taking into account the
development of the various litigation and arbitration processes and any negotiations to resolve these
cases.In2008 income of 271 million Swiss francs was recorded from the release of a provision following
the24April2008 California Supreme Court decision in the City of Hope litigation. Additional information
isgiven in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Changes in Group organisation | Effective 26 March 2009 the Group obtained full-ownership of Genentech
and further continued the implementation of the reorganisation of the Group’s US Pharmaceuticals business
announced on 21 July 2008. Subsequently, the Group commenced a restructuring of its Pharmaceuticals
manufacturing operations, particularly in the biotech network. During 2009 expenses of 2,415 million Swiss
francs were incurred, mainly in connection with the discontinuation of a construction project at the manu-
facturing site at Vacaville, California, termination costs for the closure of manufacturing operations at Nutley,
New Jersey, and the research and development site at Palo Alto, California. In addition costs were incurred
following the reorganisation including the transfer of the research operations from Palo Alto to Nutley and
the transfer of commercial operations from Nutley to South San Francisco. Approximately 1.8 billion Swiss
francs of the exceptional operating expenses are non-cash items which relate mainly to impairments of
manufacturing sites. Additional information is given in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.12
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Financial Review
The Group currently anticipates that these restructuring activities will be substantially completed by the
endof 2010. The total cost is expected to be in the order of 3.4 billion Swiss francs, which includes 243 mil-
lion Swiss francs that were incurred in 2008. Approximately 2.2 billion Swiss francs of this total is non-cash.
Thecarrying value of property, plant and equipment was reduced by 1.2 billion Swiss francs by the end of
2009, and is anticipated to be reduced by approximately 1.5 billion Swiss francs in total by the end of2010,
mostly relating to manufacturing facilities.

Operating free cash flow
The Pharmaceuticals Division continued to generate a strong cash flow. Operating free cash flow increased
by30% in local currencies driven by the excellent operating performance. Operating profit cash adjustments
increased mainly due to the 1.8 billion Swiss francs non-cash element of changes in Group organisation.
Furthermore, non-cash provision expenses exceeded provision payments by 781 million Swiss francs in 2009,
while in 2008 provision payments exceeded non-cash provision expenses by 542 million Swiss francs, mainly
as 476 million US dollars were paid by Genentech from existing provisions to settle litigation. Net working
capital decreased by 669 million Swiss francs in 2009. The main factor was higher accounts payable due
primarily to deferred income from prepaid Tamiflu consignment deliveries and increased royalty payables to
Gilead with respect to Tamiflu. Overall inventory levels decreased slightly in absolute terms, and as a percent-
age of sales inventories decreased by 2 percentage points in constant currencies to 10.5%, with operational
initiatives reducing average product inventory on hand, especially for the biologic products. Accounts
receivable increased by 6% in local currencies, which was under-proportional to sales growth. As a percent-
age of sales, accounts receivable dropped by 1 percentage point in constant currencies to 20.0%. Overall
capital expenditure was lower than in 2008. As a percentage of sales, operating free cash flow of the Pharma-
ceuticals Division increased to 38.3% compared to 33.5% in 2008.

Diagnostics operating results
The Diagnostics Division increased sales to 10.1 billion Swiss francs in 2009, growing 9% in local currencies
(4% in Swiss francs; 4% in US dollars). This growth was more than twice the estimated in-vitrodiagnostics
market rate, thereby strengthening the division’s leading market share of around 20%. The operating profit
increased by 12% in local currencies and by 1% in Swiss francs to 1,198 million Swiss francs, driven by
thesales growth, tight cost management and the significant one-off expense items in 2008 including those
relating to the Ventana acquisition. At constant exchange rates, the operating profit margin increased
by0.4percentage points. When translated in Swiss francs however, the margin decreased slightly by
0.4 percentage points to 11.9%, due to a particularly unfavourable combination of exchange rate movements
(seetables and further analysis on pages 18—19). At constant exchange rates, the margin increased by
2.3percentage points in the first half of 2009 compared to 2008, followed by a reduction of 1.3 percentage
points in the second half of 2009 compared to 2008. Continual improvements in operational efficiency could
not fully compensate the impact of impairment of intangible assets and additional royalty expenses, which
accounted for a negative swing of 1.8 percentage points in the second half of 2009. Ongoing initiatives to
improve operational efficiency include simplifying core processes, consolidation of service functions and the
establishment of regional call centres, combined with the streamlining of product portfolios and intensified
phase out of old and low-selling products.

Sales
The Diagnostics business continued to grow at more than twice the market rate with an increase of 9% in
local currencies over 2008. Major drivers were Professional Diagnostics with 9% sales growth, leveraged
byImmunodiagnostics, and Diabetes Care with 6% sales growth through sales of Accu-Chek blood glucose
monitoring systems. Sales in Molecular Diagnostics increased by 5% driven by virology and blood screening
products. Applied Science sales grew by 15% in particular due to sales of systems and reagents for nucleic
acid purification and PCR analysis. Sales of Tissue Diagnostics totalled 480 million Swiss francs driven by
sales in the advanced tissue staining market. On a comparable year-on-year basis, sales in Tissue Diagnostics
rose 21% in local currencies.

Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Financial Review
Professional Diagnostics | Sales grew at roughly twice the market rate, rising 9% to 4,553 million Swiss
francs. The immunoassay business gained additional market share on sales growth of 19%, due mainly
to new placements of the cobas modular analysers, especially the cobas 6000, and strong sales of assays
forcardiac markers and hepatitis C virus. Clinical chemistry sales rose 4%, in line with growth in this more
mature market. The cobas 8000 modular analyser series for high-throughput laboratories received CE Mark
certification in August. The rollout of this new flagship serum work area platform commenced with the
high-speed c701 and c502 clinical chemistry modules, now available in several configurations in the EU and
other markets recognising CE Marking. Four cobas 8000 clinical chemistry and immunoassay modules will
beavailable worldwide offering 38 customisable configurations by the end of 2010.
Diabetes Care | Sales rose 6% to 2,969 million Swiss francs. Sales of blood glucose (BG) monitoring
systems continued to show growth that was significantly above the market, which has been impacted by
theeconomic downturn, particularly in the US. Accu-Chek Aviva and Accu-Chek Performa remained
the primary growth drivers, helped by the recently launched Accu-Chek Aviva and Performa Nano meters.
Thefirst strip-free monitoring system, the Accu-Chek Mobile, launched in nine markets, experienced excellent
market uptake. Insulin delivery systems posted strong growth, helped by uptake of the new Accu-Chek
Combo interactive insulin pump/BG meter combination which was launched in nine key markets in 2009.
Promising preliminary results from the Accu-Chek 360°View Outcome study were presented at the recent
European Diabetes Congress. They suggest that new diabetes management concepts employing structured
BG testing can contribute to improved glycemic control and medical outcome in non-insulin-dependent
patients with type 2 diabetes.
Molecular Diagnostics | Sales rose 5% to 1,183 million Swiss francs. Blood screening was the primary
growth driver, with sales up 8%, slightly ahead of the market for the period, due to new contracts in Spain,
Portugal, Thailand and competitive gains in the UK. The unit maintained its leadership in virology with 4%
sales growth. In December Molecular Diagnostics launched the new, fully automated cobas 4800 system in
markets accepting CE Mark certification. The menu currently comprises tests for Chlamydia trachomatis(CT)
and Neisseria gonorrhoeae(NG), and a screening test for human papillomavirus (HPV) that simultaneously
identifies the high-risk genotypes 16 and 18.
Applied Science | Sales totalled 870 million Swiss francs, an above-market increase of 15% over last year.
The MagNA Pure and LightCycler systems (nucleic acid purification and PCR analysis) were the largest
contributors to growth (35%), helped by strong demand for instruments and reagents for pandemic influenza
testing and surveillance. The RealTime pandemic A (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus test, launched for research
use in May 2009, just weeks after the new virus was detected, has generated strong sales. The US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the kit in November, making it
available for clinical use in certified labs in the US. Sales of DNA sequencing reagents were up 26%, but
overall sales of DNA sequencing systems were flat due to the economic downturn and the resulting decline
inresearch funding, notably in the US.
Tissue Diagnostics | Sales totalled 480 million Swiss francs, a 29% increase over the eleven months’ sales
consolidated in 2008 following the Ventana acquisition in February of that year. On a comparable year-on-year
basis, sales rose 21%, significantly outpacing the market, due to leveraging the existing Roche infrastructure
to cover previously under-served markets. Advanced tissue staining remained the primary growth driver,
withreagents for immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing and advanced staining instruments like the BenchMark
Ultra fuelling robust 27% growth in this segment. In the high-volume primary staining market sales were
up39%, driven by the automated Symphony system and reagents for hematoxylin/eosin staining. During 2009
the business area launched 17 new IHC reagents for use in helping to diagnose various cancers, including
leukemia, lymphoma and cancers of the colon, prostate, lung and stomach.
See the Business Report (Part 1 of this Annual Report) for more information on Roche’s diagnostics products
and business areas.15
Sales by regions | Divisional sales grew ahead of the market in all regions except Japan, where price
cutsoffset volume growth. The EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia—Pacific regions contributed
mostto growth, with all five business areas recording solid gains in these markets. In North America,
intoughmarket conditions, the main growth-driver was Tissue Diagnostics. In Japan, growth in Professional
Diagnostics, Tissue Diagnostics and Applied Science was offset by sales declines in Molecular Diagnostics,
which was affected by weak market growth and price cuts, and in Diabetes Care where sales were
impacted by competitive and pricing pressures. Sales in the emerging seven (E7) markets (Brazil, Russia,
India, China,South Korea, Mexico and Turkey) grew 24% and accounted for over 10% of divisional sales.
Growthcame from increased investments in these markets with sales force and sales support, combined with
astrongdemand for immunoassays and other leading-edge products in the Roche portfolio.

Operating results
Royalties and other operating income | Income of 152 million Swiss francs was 10% higher in local
currencies compared to 2008. Royalty income increased by 27% in local currencies, mainly as a result of
higher pro-BNP and HCV royalty income. Out-licensing income can vary significantly from period to period
due to being more of a one-off nature, and in 2009 declined by 54% in local currencies.

Total 152 139 +10
Cost of sales | The overall increase of 12% in local currencies was higher than sales growth due to an
increase in manufacturing cost of goods sold and period costs. In addition the comparative period included
anacquisition accounting effect of 33 million Swiss francs of expenses relating to the fair-value write-up of
Ventana’s inventory. Excluding this acquisition accounting effect, manufacturing cost of goods sold and period
costs grew by 13% in local currencies, due to continued investments to expand market share through place-
ments of the new Accu-Chek meters, start-up costs for the Accu-Chek Mobile production and an increased
installed instrument base in Professional Diagnostics, with related higher depreciation. Impairments of product
intangibles amounted to 57 million Swiss francs due to reduced revenue expectations for some acquired
products. Total cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased to 50.5% (50.0% excluding impairments
ofintangible assets) in 2009 compared to 48.7% in 2008.16

Marketing and distribution | The increase of 5% in local currencies was mainly due to investments
to competitively fund the sequencing, array and cellular analysis businesses in Applied Science and to
further increase global market share of the recently acquired Tissue Diagnostics business. Marketing
and distribution as a percentage of sales was 25.0% compared to 25.6% in 2008.
Research and development | Costs increased by 5% in local currencies reflecting investments into
TissueDiagnostics to develop new products and Molecular Diagnostics for the ATHENA trial for a HPV claim
in the US. In addition, there was an intangible asset impairment of 23 million Swiss francs. As a percentage
ofsales, research and development costs remained stable at 9.7%. Excluding the impairment, research
anddevelopment expenses as a percentage of sales declined slightly to 9.5%.

General and administration | General and administration costs decreased by 9% in local currencies,
primarily following the absence in 2009 of significant one-off expenses in 2008. The decline in administration
costs of 3% is due to continuous efficiency improvements of the underlying cost structure and to the inclusion
in 2008 of 15 million Swiss francs of Ventana integration costs. Excluding one-off expenses in 2008, general
and administration expenses as a percentage of sales remained basically stable at 4.4% compared to 4.5%
in2008.

Operating free cash flow
The operating free cash flow of the Diagnostics Division increased by 102% in local currencies, driven by
strong operating performance. Operating profit cash adjustments increased mainly due to provisions,
as non-cash provision expenses exceeded provision payments by 62 million Swiss francs in 2009, while in
2008 provision payments exceeded non-cash provision expenses by 52 million Swiss francs. Net working
capital increased by 259 million Swiss francs, mainly due to an increase in accounts receivable following
strong sales in the fourth quarter of 2009. Inventories increased slightly, mainly as a result of preparation for
the launch of the cobas 8000. As a percentage of sales, operating free cash flow of the Diagnostics Division
increased to 11.5% compared to 6.2% in 2008.

Corporate operating costs
General and administration | In local currencies costs in 2009 were 30% higher at 340 million Swiss francs
(265 million Swiss francs in 2008), primarily due to an increase of 50 million Swiss francs in environmental
provisions in the residual vitamins and fine chemicals business and contributions of 21 million Swiss francs
tothe state-managed pension insurance scheme in Germany. Operating free cash flow was a net outflow
of353 million Swiss francs (2008: net outflow of 275 million Swiss francs) mainly due to the higher operating
expenses.18

Foreign exchange impact on operating results
The Group’s exposure to movements in foreign currencies affecting its operating results, as expressed
inSwiss francs, is summarised by the following key figures and comments.

During 2009 the euro and many other currencies weakened against the Swiss franc, which reduces on trans-
lation the Swiss franc amount of any revenues and expenses in euros and these other currencies. At the same
time US dollar was stable and the Japanese yen strengthened against the Swiss franc. This strengthening
upon translation in the Group’s income statement increases the Swiss franc amount of revenues and expenses
denominated in yen.
In the Pharmaceuticals Division, on a sales level, the negative translation impact from the euro and other
currencies is only partly offset by the positive impact of the yen, with sales growth in local currencies being
11% compared to 8% in Swiss francs. At an operating profit level the effect is more noticeable, due to
relatively higher expenses and asset intensity in eurozone countries and the United States compared
toJapan. Operating profit before exceptional items increased 15% in local currencies compared to 9% in
Swiss francs, and the margin increase of 1.2 percentage points in local currencies only translates to
amarginincrease of 0.2% in Swiss francs.
In the Diagnostic Division the effects are more pronounced due to the relative strength and asset intensity
ofthe Diagnostics Division in Germany. The business in Japan represents a relatively smaller proportion
oftheoverall Diagnostics results, while at the same time one of the key third-party suppliers for diagnostics
instruments is a Japan-based company that is invoicing in yen. In combination this means that the negative
impact of the euro is stronger and the yen does not have a strong positive impact. This results in sales growth
in local currencies of 9% only translating into 4% in Swiss francs. Similarly the operating profit before excep-
tional items increase of 12% in local currencies translates to only 1% in Swiss francs, while the local currency
margin increase of 0.4 percentage points translates into a Swiss franc margin decline of 0.4% inSwiss francs.
The sensitivity of Group sales and operating profit before exceptional items in absolute terms to a 1%

The Group financed the Genentech transaction by a combination of the Group’s own funds, bonds, notes
andcommercial paper. The Group raised net proceeds of 48.2 billion Swiss francs through a series of bond
and note offerings. As a consequence the underlying dynamics of the Group’s Treasury results changed
significantly during 2009, with a substantial increase in interest expenses. In 2009 financing costs exceeded
financial income by 1,668 million Swiss francs. In addition, exceptional financing costs of 377 million Swiss
francs were recorded for one-time costs directly attributable to the transaction. The tax impact of the financing
costs contributed to the decline of the Group’s effective tax rate before exceptional items to 21.5% compared
to 23.4% in 2008. Net income decreased by 22% primarily due to the exceptional items. Excluding these,
net income was down 3% due to higher financing costs. However the income attributable to Roche share-
holders, before exceptional items, was 9% higher than in 2008 as lower non-controlling interests following
theGenentech transaction more than compensated for the associated higher financing costs.20

Financial income
Financial income was 792 million Swiss francs in 2009, declining 29% compared to 2008. Interest income
andincome from debt securities were 218 million Swiss francs, down 44% due to lower market interest rates,
a change in the asset allocation from bonds into lower-yielding money instruments and lower debt security
holdings. Net income from equity securities was 36 million Swiss francs compared to 133 million Swiss francs
in 2008. Expected returns on pension plan assets were 507 million Swiss francs, down 26% compared
to2008 due to a lower asset base at the year-end 2008. A full analysis of financial income is given in Note 5
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Financing costs
Financing costs were 2,460 million Swiss francs, 1,573 million Swiss francs higher than in 2008 reflecting
theadditional financing costs for new debt issued in connection with the Genentech transaction from
theeffective date of 26 March 2009 to 31 December 2009. The interest cost of pension plans was 656 million
Swiss francs, a slight increase compared to 2008. A full analysis of financing costs is given in Note 5 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Exceptional financing costs
In order to execute the Genentech transaction, the Group liquidated certain debt securities into cash.
Thisresulted in a net loss on these transactions of 238 million Swiss francs. Furthermore, due to the prevailing
financial conditions in the first quarter of 2009, the Group issued bonds and notes in advance of the trans-
action totalling 48.2 billion Swiss francs through a series of debt offerings. The interest expense on these
instruments for the bridging period between their issue and the completion of the Genentech transaction on
26 March 2009 was 139 million Swiss francs.
Income taxes
The Group’s effective tax rate before exceptional items declined to 21.5% compared to the 2008 rate of
23.4%. The main driver was the additional financing costs for the Genentech transaction from the effective
date of 26 March 2009 to 31 December 2009.
A net tax benefit of 817 million Swiss francs was recorded for the exceptional operating items connected
withthe Genentech transaction and the related reorganisation of the pharmaceuticals business. In addition,
an income tax benefit of 147 million Swiss francs in respect of Genentech’s stock options is clearly
attributable to the Genentech transaction. Other exceptional tax items are shown in the table below.

of the operating income/expenses for provisions, equity compensation plans and disposals of property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets with their cash equivalents. A detailed breakdown is provided on page 135.
The free cash flow of the Group in 2009 increased significantly by 3.9 billion Swiss francs to 8.9 billion
Swissfrancs. This increase was primarily due to a higher operating free cash flow and lower tax payments.
These factors more than covered the higher dividend payments of 4.4 billion Swiss francs.
The underlying business continued to show good cash generation with the operating free cash flow
increasing by 34% in local currencies (27% in Swiss francs). This was in contrast to the decrease in operating
profit, due to the impact of a number of non-cash items, notably expense for provision in 2009. These
areshown in the breakdown on page 135. Net working capital was reduced slightly overall despitethe
continued growth of the business. Capital expenditure in total was slightly lower than the previous year.
In the third quarter of 2009 significant interest payments were made for the new debt issued in 2009. The
major coupon payment dates are in the first and third quarter each year. Total taxes paid in 2009 decreased
by 1.7 billion Swiss francs compared to 2008 driven by a one-time 1.1 billion Swiss francs tax benefit on
thesettlement of stock options with Genentech employees upon closing of the transaction.23

The purchase of all outstanding publicly held shares in Genentech, including the settlement of Genentech’s
outstanding employee stock option plans and payment of related fees and expenses resulted in a cash
outflow of 47.0 billion US dollars (52.7 billion Swiss francs), as described in Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. This was recorded to equity as a change in ownership interest in subsidiaries.
The free cash flow described above already compensated for almost 9 billion Swiss francs of the cash used
for the Genentech transaction, even taking into account the Group’s record dividend payment. Own equity
instruments were purchased to cover the Group’s obligations for its equity compensation plans.
A positive cash flow of 3.3 billion Swiss francs was generated from the hedging and collateral arrangements
that were set up following the financing of the Genentech transaction (see the ‘Debt’ section below and
Note27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As the fair value of the derivative instruments moved up
due to a weaker US dollar, cash collateral of net 1.5 billion Swiss francs was delivered to Roche. In addition
the Group generated cash flows of 1.8 billion Swiss francs from realised gains on hedging derivatives with
shorter maturities that were settled during 2009.
The net debt position of the Group is 23.9 billion Swiss francs, a movement of 40.6 billion Swiss francs from
anet cash position of 16.7 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2008 due to the 52.7 billion Swiss francs used
in the Genentech transaction.24

A full consolidated balance sheet is given on page 33 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Group completed the purchase of the non-controlling interests in Genentech effective 26 March 2009
(see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Based on the revised International Accounting
Standard 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ (IAS 27), which was adopted by the Group in
2008, this transaction was accounted for in full as an equity transaction. As a consequence, the carrying
amount of the consolidated equity of the Group was reduced by 52.2 billion Swiss francs, of which 8.5 billion
Swiss francs was allocated to eliminate the book value of Genentech non-controlling interests. This account-
ing effect significantly impacts the Group’s net equity, but has no effect on the Group’s business or its
dividend policy. The transaction was not accounted for as a business combination, and therefore no additional
goodwill or intangible assets were recorded.
Non-current assets | Property, plant and equipment declined due to impairments of certain Pharmaceuticals
Division manufacturing sites, in particular the discontinuation of a construction project at the manufacturing
site at Vacaville, California. Intangible assets decreased by 16% due to amortisation and higher impairment
charges.25
Current assets | Accounts receivable were higher in local currencies, reflecting the growth of the business.
Inventory levels reduced slightly overall showing improvements to operational efficiency. Cash and marketable
securities declined by 11%. Other current assets also increased by 1.5 billion Swiss francs due to the fair
valuemovements in derivatives hedging the non-US dollar-denominated debt.
Debt | There was a significant increase in debt to finance the Genentech transaction. In February and
March2009, the Group performed a series of bond and note offerings generating net proceeds of
48.2 billion Swiss francs. The carrying value of debt at 31 December 2009 was 42.4 billion Swiss francs,
compared to 4.1 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2008.
Other non-current and current liabilities | The overall balance increased by 4.6 billion Swiss francs mainly
due to 3.4 billion Swiss francs higher accrued and other current liabilities, which includes 1.5 billion Swiss
francs in respect of the cash collateral received in respect of the derivates that hedge debt. There was also
anincrease of 0.9 billion Swiss francs in provisions, primarily for litigation and restructuring.
Total net assets/equity | The most significant movements in equity were the impact of the change in owner-
ship interests in Genentech of 52.2 billion Swiss francs changes, the net income of 8.5 billion Swiss francs,
the dividend payments of 4.4 billion Swiss francs and currency translation gains of 3.1 billion Swiss francs.
Overall capitalisation, being total debt plus equity, declined by 11%, with the decrease in the second half
of2009 being due to debt repayments. The split between debt and equity changed significantly compared
to2008.
Debt
To finance the Genentech transaction, the Group issued bonds and notes equivalent to 48.2 billion Swiss
francs in February and March 2009. Of the debt raised in early 2009, 6.9 billion Swiss francs had already been
repaid by the end of 2009, either by repayment on maturity of six-month debt or by early redemption.
The maturity schedule of the Group’s bonds and notes outstanding at 31 December 2009 is shown in the
table below, which includes those instruments that were already in issue prior to the Genentech transaction.

2) The proceeds from these bonds and notes were swapped into US dollars, and therefore in the financial statements the bonds and
notes have economic characteristics equivalent to US dollar-denominated bonds and notes.
The Group entered into derivative contracts with third parties to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from
bonds and notes issued in currencies other than US dollar. The total exposure hedged at issuance of these
bonds and notes was approximately 25 billion Swiss francs (see Note 27). Collateral agreements were entered
with the derivative counterparties to mitigate counterparty risk (see Notes 27 and 32).26
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Financial Review
The Group plans to meet its debt obligations using cash generated from the underlying business. In 2009
FreeCash Flow was 8.9 billion Swiss francs, which includes the cash generated from operations, as well as
payment of interest, tax and dividends. Of the debt raised to finance the Genentech transaction, 25% of it
willhave been repaid by the end of 2010.
For short-term financing requirements, the Group has a commercial paper program in the United States under
which it can issue up to 7.5 billion US dollars of unsecured commercial paper notes and committed credit
lines of 2.5 billion euros and 950 million US dollars available as back-stop lines. Commercial paper notes
totalling 0.3 billion US dollars were outstanding as of 31 December 2009. For longer term financing the Group
maintains strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA- by Standard & Poor’s and A2 by Moody’s
which should facilitate efficient access to international capital markets.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefit plans are classified as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or
constructive obligation to pay further contributions. In 2009 expenses for the Group’s defined contribution
plans were 295 million Swiss francs (2008: 253 million Swiss francs).
All other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’, even if the Group’s potential obligation is relatively
minor or has a relatively remote possibility of arising. The funding and asset management of the Group’s
various defined benefit plans is overseen at a corporate level. Plans are usually established as trusts
independent of the Group and are funded by payments from the Group and by employees, but in some cases
the plan is unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial
resources.

— Over (under) funding (737) (1,066)
Unfunded plans
— Defined benefit obligation (3,486) (3,078)
Funding status | Overall the Group’s defined benefit plans continue to be adequately funded despite
thefinancial turbulence during 2009 with the funding status at 93% compared to 90% at the beginning ofthe
year. The main movements came from an increase in the fair value of plan assets following declines in global
financial markets in previous years. A small overall decline in discount rates caused an increase in the defined
benefit obligation.
Expenses recorded in income statement | Total pension expenses in 2009 relating to the Group’s defined
benefit plans were 464 million Swiss francs compared to 281 million Swiss francs in 2008. The increase
of39% is primarily due to a lower expected return on plan assets arising mainly as a consequence of a lower
asset base at the year-end 2008. Based on the revised actuarial assumptions at the end of 2009, total
pension expenses for 2010 are expected to remain broadly stable compared to 2009.
Full details of the Group’s pensions and other post-employment benefits are given in Note 10 to the

Proposed dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing an increase of 20% in the dividend for 2009 to 6.00 Swiss francs per
share and non-voting equity security (2008: 5.00 Swiss francs) for approval at the Annual General Meeting.
This is the 23rdconsecutive increase in the dividend. If the dividend proposal is approved by shareholders,
dividend payments on the shares and non-voting equity securities in issue will amount to 5.2 billion Swiss
francs (2008: 4.3 billion Swiss francs), resulting in a payout ratio of 53% (2008: 49%). Based on the prices at
year-end 2009, the dividend yield on the Roche share is 3.3% (2008: 3.0%) and the yield on the non-voting
equity security is 3.4% (2008: 3.1%). Further information on the Roche securities is given on pages 136—137
ofthe Finance Report.28

Financial risks
The Group’s risk profile has changed significantly following the Genentech transaction, as bonds and notes
of48.2 billion Swiss francs were issued during 2009. As a consequence, at 31 December 2009 the Group
has a net debt position of 24 billion Swiss francs (31 December 2008: net cash position of 17 billion Swiss
francs). The financial assets of the Group are managed in a conservative way with the objective to meet
theGroup’s financial obligations at all times.
Asset allocation | A significant portion of the cash and marketable securities the Group currently holds will
be used for debt redemptions and interest service in March 2010. Liquid funds are either held as cash or are
invested in high-quality, investment-grade fixed income securities with a short-term investment horizon to
meet those liquidity requirements. During 2009, Roche reduced its bond portfolio by 7.1 billion Swiss francs
asbonds matured or were sold. The higher holdings in shares are due to the reclassification of certain
equitysecurities from long-term investments into short-term marketable securities, as they are no longer
considered as strategic investments.

Total cash and marketable securities 18,549 100 20,771 100
Credit risk | Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their
obligations, causing financial losses for the Group. Despite significant market difficulties since mid-2008,
therating profile of the Group’s 18.2 billion Swiss francs fixed income marketable securities remained strong,
with 99% being invested in the A-AAA range. The Group signs netting and collateral agreements with
thederivatives counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty risk on derivative positions. The counterparty
profile of the Group’s 10.5 billion Swiss francs trade receivables remains well diversified across types
of customer and regions, with some wholesaler concentration in the US.
Liquidity risk | Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets
due at any point in time. The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available
reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements at any point in time. In addition to current liquidity position,
the Group has strong cash generation ability. Those future cash flows will be used to repay debt instruments
in the coming years.29
Even after the Genentech transaction, Roche enjoys strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA-
by Standard & Poor’s and A2 by Moody’s. At the same time Roche is rated at the highest available short-term
ratings by those agencies. In the event of financing requirements, the ratings and the strong credit of Roche
should permit efficient access to international capital markets, including the commercial paper market.
TheGroup has committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling 5.1 billion Swiss francs
(2008:5.2billion Swiss francs), of which 4.7 billion Swiss francs serve as back-stop line for the commercial
paper programme. As at 31 December 2009, no debt has been drawn under these credit lines.
Market risks | Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial
liabilities. The exposures are predominantly related to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and
equity prices. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to assess the impact of market risk on its financial
instruments. VaR data indicates the value range within which a given financial instrument will fluctuate with
apre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices. The VaR data in the table below indicate
theeconomic loss level over a period of one month which with 95% probability will not be exceeded. Actual
future economic gains and losses associated with our treasury activities may differ materially from the VaR
analyses performed due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of
changes to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity investment prices, particularly in periods
of high market volatilities. Furthermore, the VaR numbers below do not include a credit risk component.
Market risk of financial instruments
31 December 2009 31 December 2008
(mCHF) (mCHF)
VaR — Interest rate component 717 27
VaR — Foreign exchange component 43 96
VaR — Other price component 57 62
Diversification (98) (52)
VaR — Total 719 133
At 31 December 2009, the total VaR of the financial assets and liabilities was 719 million Swiss francs
(31December 2008: 133 million Swiss francs). The interest rate VaR increased substantially to 717 million
Swiss francs driven by the 48.2 billion Swiss francs of bonds and notes issued in the first quarter of 2009.
Asall newly issued debt is held at amortised cost, the interest rate VaR is a sole metric for economic fair
valuechanges, but there is no impact on the carrying value or profit and loss of the Group. The foreign
exchange VaR decreased as hedges of non-US dollar cash flows from future royalty income at Genentech
were unwound. Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities and remained
relatively stable. At 31 December 2009, the Group held equity securities with a market value of 0.6 billion
Swiss francs (31 December 2008: 0.6 billion Swiss francs). This includes holdings in biotechnology companies,
which were acquired in the context of licensing transactions or scientific collaborations.
Further information on financial risk management and financial risks and the VaR methodology is included
inNote 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financial Statements

1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of the Roche Group have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. They have been prepared
using the historical cost convention except that, as disclosed in the accounting policies below, certain
items,including derivatives and available-for-sale investments, are shown at fair value. They were approved
for issue by the Board of Directors on 28 January 2010 and are subject to approval by the Annual General
Meeting of shareholders on 2 March 2010.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure
of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. If in the future such estimates and assumptions,
which are based on management’s best judgement at the date of the financial statements, deviate from the
actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the year
inwhich the circumstances change.
Changes in accounting policies that arise from the application of new or revised standards and interpreta-
tionsare applied retrospectively, unless otherwise specified in the transitional requirements of the particular
standard or interpretation. Retrospective application requires that the results of the comparative period
andthe opening balances of that period are restated as if the new accounting policy had always been
applied. In some cases the transitional requirements of the particular standard or interpretation specify that
the changes are to be applied prospectively. Prospective application requires that the new accounting policy
only be applied to the results of the current period and the comparative period is not restated. In addition
comparatives have been reclassified or extended from the previously reported results to take into account
anypresentational changes.
Consolidation policy
These financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, a company
registered in Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’).
The subsidiaries are those companies controlled, directly or indirectly, by Roche Holding Ltd, where control
isdefined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits
from its activities. This control is normally evidenced when Roche Holding Ltd owns, either directly or
indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or currently exercisable potential voting rights of a company’s
share capital. Special Purpose Entities are consolidated where the substance of the relationship is that the
Special Purpose Entity is controlled by the Group. Companies acquired during the year are consolidated
fromthe date on which control is transferred to the Group, and subsidiaries to be divested are included up
tothedate on which control passes from the Group. Inter-company balances, transactions and resulting
unrealised income are eliminated in full. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for
asequity transactions if they occur after control has already been obtained and if they do not result in
alossof control.37
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. These are companies over which the
Group exercises, or has the power to exercise, significant influence, but which it does not control. This is
normally evidenced when the Group owns 20% or more of the voting rights or currently exercisable potential
voting rights of the company. Balances and transactions with associates that result in unrealised income
areeliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate. Interests in joint ventures are reported
using the line-by-line proportionate consolidation method.
Segment reporting
The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the organisation units for which
informationis reported to the Group’s management. The Group has two divisions, Pharmaceuticals and
Diagnostics. Revenues are primarily generated from the sale of prescription pharmaceutical products
anddiagnostic instruments, reagents and consumables, respectively. Both divisions also derive revenue from
the sale or licensing of products or technology to third parties. Certain headquarter activities are reported
as‘Corporate’. These consist of corporate headquarters, including the Corporate Executive Committee,
corporate communications, corporate human resources, corporate finance, including treasury, taxes and
pension fund management, corporate legal and corporate safety and environmental services. Previously within
the Pharmaceuticals Division there had been three sub-divisions, Roche Pharmaceuticals, Genentech and
Chugai. Following the completion of the Genentech transaction (see Note 3), the Genentech sub-division was
merged into the Roche Pharmaceuticals sub-division, and the Chugai sub-division is aggregated as part
ofthePharmaceuticals Division in these consolidated financial statements.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis. Operating assets and
liabilitiesconsist of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade receivables/payables,
inventories and other assets and liabilities, such as provisions, which can be reasonably attributed to the
reported operating segments. Non-operating assets and liabilities mainly include current and deferred income
tax balances, post-employment benefit assets/liabilities and financial assets/liabilities such as cash,
marketable securities, investments and debt.
Foreign currency translation
Most Group companies use their local currency as their functional currency. Certain Group companies
useother currencies (such as US dollars, Swiss francs or euros) as their functional currency where this is the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Local transactions in other
currencies are initially reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses from
the settlement of such transactions and gains and losses on translation of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in other currencies are included in income, except when they are qualifying cash flow hedges
orarise on monetary items that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign entity.
Insuch cases the gains and losses are deferred into equity.
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using functional currencies other than Swiss
francs (foreign entities) are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange. Sales, costs,
expenses, net income and cash flows are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Translation
differences due to the changes in exchange rates between the beginning and the end of the year and the
difference between net income translated at the average and year-end exchange rates are taken directly
to equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the identified cumulative currency translation differences within
equity relating to that foreign entity are recognised in income as part of the gain or loss on divestment.38
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Revenues
Sales represent amounts received and receivable for goods supplied to customers after deducting trade
discounts, cash discounts and volume rebates, and exclude value added taxes and other taxes directly linked
to sales. Revenues from the sale of products are recognised upon transfer to the customer of significant
risksand rewards. Trade discounts, cash discounts and volume rebates are recorded on an accrual basis
consistent with the recognition of the related sales. Estimates of expected sales returns, charge-backs
andother rebates, including Medicaid in the United States and similar rebates in other countries, are also
deducted from sales and recorded as accrued liabilities or provisions or as a deduction from accounts
receivable. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual or legislatively mandated obligations,
historical trends and the Group’s experience. If the circumstances are such that the level of sales returns,
andhence revenues, cannot be reliably measured, then sales are only recognised when the right of return
expires, which is generally upon prescription of the products to patients. Other revenues are recorded
asearned or as the services are performed. Where necessary, single transactions are split into separately
identifiable components to reflect the substance of the transaction. Conversely, two or more transactions
maybe considered together for revenue recognition purposes, where the commercial effect cannot be
understood without reference to the series of transactions as a whole.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and related production overheads of
goodssold and services rendered. Royalties, alliance and collaboration expenses, including all collaboration
profit-sharing arrangements are also reported as part of cost of sales. Start-up costs between validation
andthe achievement of normal production capacity are expensed as incurred.
Research and development
In addition to its internal research and development activities, the Group is also party to in-licensing
and similar arrangements with its alliance partners. The Group may also acquire in-process research and
development assets, either through business combinations or through purchases of specific assets.
Internal research costs are charged against income as incurred. Internal development costs are capitalised
asintangible assets only when there is an identifiable asset that can be completed and that will generate
probable future economic benefits and when the cost of such an asset can be measured reliably. The Group
does not currently have any such internal development costs that qualify for capitalisation as intangible
assets. Internal development costs are therefore charged against income as incurred since the criteria for
their recognition as an asset are not met.
In-process research and development assets acquired either through in-licensing arrangements, business
combinations or separate purchases are capitalised as intangible assets as described below. Once available
for use, such intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the expected benefit
and are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date.
Licensing, milestone and other upfront receipts and payments
Royalty income is recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the respective
licensingagreements. If the collectability of a royalty amount is not reasonably assured, those royalties are
recognised as revenue when the cash is received. Certain Group companies receive from third parties upfront,
milestone and other similar payments relating to the sale or licensing of products or technology. Revenue
associated with performance milestones is recognised based on achievement of the deliverables as defined in
the respective agreements. Upfront payments and licence fees for which there are subsequent deliverables
are initially reported as deferred income and are recognised in income as earned over the period of the
development collaboration or the manufacturing obligation.
Payments made by Group companies to third parties and associates for such items are capitalised as
intangible assets.39
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary
benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group.
Where the Group provides long-term employee benefits, the cost is accrued to match the rendering of the
services by the employees concerned. Liabilities for long-term employee benefits are discounted to take
intoaccount the time value of money, where material.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Most employees are covered by defined benefit and defined contribution post-employment plans sponsored
by Group companies. The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the appropriate
income statement heading within the operating results in the year to which they relate. The accounting and
reporting of defined benefit plans are based on recent actuarial valuations. The defined benefit obligations
and service costs are calculated using the projected unit credit method. This reflects service rendered by
employees to the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates
used in determining the present value of benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth and long-term
expected rates of return for plan assets. Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-quality corpo-
rate bonds in the country concerned. Past service costs are allocated over the average period until the
benefits become vested. Current and past service costs are charged to the appropriate income statement
heading within the operating results. Pension plan administration and funding is overseen at a corporate
leveland any settlement gains and losses resulting from changes in funding arrangements are reported
asgeneral and administration expenses within the ‘Corporate’ segment. The expected returns on plan assets
and interest costs are charged to financial income and financing costs, respectively. Actuarial gains and
losses, which consist of differences between assumptions and actual experiences and the effects of changes
in actuarial assumptions, are recorded directly in equity. Pension assets and liabilities in different defined
benefit plans are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to use the surplus in one plan to
settle obligations in the other plan. The recognition of pension assets is limited to the total of the present
value of any future refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans and any cumulative
unrecognised past service costs. Adjustments arising from the limit on the recognition of assets for defined
benefit plans are recorded directly in equity.
Equity compensation plans
Certain employees of the Group participate in equity compensation plans, including separate plans at
Genentech (prior to the Genentech transaction) and at Chugai. The fair value of all equity compensation
awards granted to employees is estimated at the grant date and recorded as an expense over the vesting
period. The expense is charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating
results.Forequity-settled plans, an increase in equity is recorded for this expense and any subsequent cash
flows from exercises of vested awards are recorded as changes in equity. For cash-settled plans, a liability
is recorded, which is measured at fair value at each reporting date with any movements in fair value being
recorded to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results. Any subsequent cash
flows from exercise of vested awards are recorded as a reduction of the liability.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction, and include all
costsdirectly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of
operating in the manner intended by management. These include items such as costs of site preparation,
installation and assembly costs and professional fees. The net costs of testing whether the asset is functioning
properly, including validation costs, are also included in the initially recorded cost of construction. Interest
and other borrowing costs incurred with respect to qualifying assets are capitalised and included in the
carrying value of the assets.40
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis, except for land, which is not
depreciated. Estimated useful lives of major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
Land improvements 40 years
Buildings 10—50 years
Machinery and equipment 5—15 years
Diagnostic instruments 3—5 years
Office equipment 3 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as
separate components. The estimated useful life of the assets is regularly reviewed and, if necessary, the future
depreciation charge is accelerated. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Leases
Where the Group is the lessee, leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially
allof the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised
atthestart of the lease at fair value, or the present value of the minimum lease payments, if lower. The rental
obligation, net of finance charges, is reported within debt. Assets acquired under finance leases are
depreciated in accordance with the Group’s policy on property, plant and equipment. If there is no reasonable
certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over
theshorter of the lease term and its useful life. The interest element of the lease payment is charged against
income over the lease term based on the effective interest rate method. Leases where substantially all of
therisks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the period
ofthe lease.
Where the Group is the lessor, which primarily occurs in the Diagnostics Division, assets subject to finance
leases are initially reported as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Assets
subject to operating leases are reported within property, plant and equipment. Lease income from finance
leases is subsequently recognised as earned income over the term of the lease based on the effective interest
rate method. Lease income from operating leases is recognised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The consideration
transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. This consideration
includes the cash paid plus the fair value at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or
assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group. The fair value of the consideration transferred also
includes contingent consideration arrangements at fair value. Directly attributable acquisition-related costs
are expensed in the current period and reported within general and administration expenses. At the date
ofacquisition the Group recognises the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-
controlling interest in the acquired business. The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are
initially recognised at fair value. Where the Group does not acquire 100% ownership of the acquired
businessnon-controlling interests are recorded as the proportion of the fair value of the acquired net assets
attributable to the non-controlling interest. Goodwill is recorded as the surplus of the consideration
transferred over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquired net assets. Any goodwill and fair value
adjustments are recorded as assets and liabilities of the acquired business in the functional currency of
thatbusiness. Goodwill is not amortised, but is assessed for possible impairment at each reporting date and
isadditionally tested annually for impairment. Goodwill may also arise upon investments in associates, being
the surplus of the cost of investment over the Group’s share of the fair value of the net identifiable assets.
Such goodwill is recorded within investments in associates. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries
areaccounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has already been obtained and if they
donot result in a loss of control.41
Intangible assets
Purchased patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Where
theseassets have been acquired through a business combination, this will be the fair value allocated
intheacquisition accounting. Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis
beginning from the point when they are available for use. Estimated useful life is the lower of the legal
duration and the economic useful life. The estimated useful life of intangible assets is regularly reviewed.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
An impairment assessment is carried out when there is evidence that an asset may be impaired. In addition
intangible assets that are not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. When the recoverable
amount of an asset, being the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, is less than its
carrying value, then the carrying value is reduced to its recoverable amount. This reduction is reported in the
income statement as an impairment loss. Value in use is calculated using estimated cash flows, generally
overa five-year period, with extrapolating projections for subsequent years. These are discounted using
anappropriate long-term pre-tax interest rate. When an impairment loss arises, the useful life of the asset
inquestion is reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation/amortisation charge is accelerated.
Theimpairment of financial assets is discussed below in the ‘Financial assets’ policy.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is assessed for possible impairment at each reporting date and is additionally tested annually for
impairment. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units as described in Note 13. When the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit, being the higher of its fair value less costs to sell or its value in use,
isless than its carrying value, then the carrying value of the goodwill is reduced to its recoverable amount.
This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. The methodology used in the
impairment testing is further described in Note 13.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods and work in
process includes raw materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs and overheads based
uponthe normal capacity of production facilities. Cost is determined using the weighted average method.
Netrealisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to completion and selling expenses.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts,
trade discounts, cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances. An allowance for doubtful accounts
isrecorded for the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount where there is objective
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. Trade discounts, cash discounts, volume
rebates and similar allowances are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of the related
sales, using estimates based on existing contractual obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience.
Long-term accounts receivable are discounted to take into account the time value of money, where material.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and time, call and current balances with banks and similar
institutions. Such balances are only reported as cash if they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash,
are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date
of acquisition. This definition is also used for the statement of cash flows.42
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Provisions
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably
leadto an outflow of resources that can be reasonably estimated. In particular, restructuring provisions are
recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan that has either commenced implementation or been
announced. Provisions are recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise, taking into
account foreign currency effects arising from their translation from their functional currency into Swiss francs
and the time value of money, where material. A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the
obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured
with reasonable reliability. Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of
economic benefits is probable.
Fair values
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between
knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by reference to quoted
market prices or by the use of established valuation techniques such as option pricing models and the
discounted cash flow method if quoted prices in an active market are not available (‘fair value hierarchy’).
Valuation techniques will incorporate observable market data about market conditions and other factors that
are likely to affect the fair value of a financial instrument. Valuation techniques are typically used for derivative
financial instruments. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities at the reporting date are not materially
different from their reported carrying values unless specifically mentioned in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Information on fair value hierarchy is included in Note 32 on risk management.
Financial assets
Financial assets, principally investments, including marketable securities, are classified as either ‘Fair-value-
through-profit-or-loss’, ‘Available-for-sale’, ‘Held-to-maturity’ or ‘Loans and receivables’. Fair-value-through-
profit-or-loss financial assets are either classified as held-for-trading or designated upon initial recognition.
Held-for-trading financial assets are acquired principally to generate profit from short-term fluctuations in
price. Financial assets are designated as fair-value-through-profit-or-loss if doing so results in more relevant
information by eliminating a measurement or recognition inconsistency. Held-to-maturity financial assets
aresecurities with a fixed maturity that the Group has the intent and ability to hold until maturity. Loans and
receivables are financial assets created by the Group or acquired from the issuer in a primary market.
Theyare non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. All other financial assets are considered to be available-for-sale.
All financial assets are initially recorded at fair value, including transaction costs, except for assets at
fair-value-through-profit-or-loss, which exclude transaction costs. All purchases and sales are recognised on
the settlement date. Fair-value-through-profit-or-loss financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value,
with all changes in fair value recorded as financial income in the period in which they arise. Held-to-maturity
financial assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Available-
for-sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value, with all unrealised changes in fair value
recorded in equity except for interest calculated using the effective interest rate method and foreign exchange
components. When the available-for-sale financial assets are sold, impaired or otherwise disposed of,
thecumulative gains and losses previously recognised in equity are included in financial income for the
current period. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective
interestrate method.43
Financial assets are individually assessed for possible impairment at each reporting date. An impairment
charge is recorded where there is objective evidence of impairment, such as where the issuer is in
bankruptcy, default or other significant financial difficulty. In addition any available-for-sale equity securities
that have a market value of more than 25% below their original cost, net of any previous impairment,
willbeconsidered as impaired. Any available-for-sale equity securities that have a market value below their
original cost, net of any previous impairment, for a sustained six-month period will also be considered as
impaired. Any decreases in the market price of less than 25% of original cost, net of any previous impairment,
which arealso for less than a sustained six-month period are not by themselves considered as objective
evidence ofimpairment. Such movements in fair value are recorded in equity until there is objective
evidenceof impairment or until the asset is sold or otherwise disposed of. For financial assets carried at
amortised cost,any impairment charge is the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable
amount, calculated using estimated future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate.
Foravailable-for-sale financial assets, any impairment charge is the amount currently carried in equity for
thedifference between the original cost, net of any previous impairment, and the fair value. An impairment
loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss
wasrecognised. For debt securities measured at amortised cost or available-for-sale, the reversal is recognised
in income. For equity securities held available-for-sale, the reversal is recognised directly in equity.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual cash flows from the asset expire or when the Group
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows from the financial assets in a transaction in
whichsubstantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest
intransferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset
or liability.
Derivatives
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Apart from those
derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments as discussed in the ‘Hedging’ policy
below, all changes in fair value are recorded as financial income in the period in which they arise. Embedded
derivatives are recognised separately if not closely related to the host contract and where the host contract
iscarried at amortised cost.
Hedge accounting
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types. A ‘fair value hedge’
isahedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or an unrecognised firm
commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to
aparticular risk and could affect profit or loss. A ‘cash flow hedge’ is a hedge of the exposure to variability
incash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a
highlyprobable forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss. A ‘hedge of a net investment in a foreign
operation’ is a hedge of the foreign currency exposure on a net investment in a foreign operation.
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation,
probability of occurrence (for cash flow hedges), hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
Iftheseconditions are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case
thehedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relation-
ship. In particular any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial
income.
For qualifying fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item
isrecorded at its previous carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair value that are attributable to the
hedged risk. Any changes in the fair values are reported in financial income.44
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of any change
in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity, and any remaining ineffective portion is reported
infinancial income. If the hedging relationship is the hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment
or highly probable forecasted transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability,
thecumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are
included in the initial carrying value of the asset or liability at the date of recognition. For all other qualifying
cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been
recordedin equity are included in financial income when the forecasted transaction affects net income.
For qualifying hedges of net investment in a foreign entity, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value.
The portion of any change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity. Any remaining
ineffective portion is recorded in financial income where the hedging instrument is a derivative and in equity
in other cases. If the entity is disposed of, then the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging
instrumentthat have been recorded in equity are reclassified to income.
Debt
Debt instruments are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Subsequently they are reported at amortised cost. Any discount between the net proceeds received and the
principal value due on redemption is amortised over the duration of the debt instrument and is recognised
aspart of financing costs using the effective interest rate method. The Group derecognises a financial liability
when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
Certain debt instruments have been designated as ‘fair-value-through-profit-or-loss’ where doing so results
inmore relevant information as it eliminates or significantly reduces measurement or recognition inconsistencies.
Such debt instruments were reported at fair value, based on quoted prices in an active market, with
movements in fair value reported within financial income. The Group’s last such instrument was redeemed
on6 July 2009 as disclosed in Note 27.
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding taxes
payable on the distribution of retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based on income, such as
property and capital taxes, are included within general and administration expenses.
Liabilities for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained
earnings, principally relating to subsidiaries, are only recognised where it is probable that such earnings
willbe remitted in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements. Deferred income tax assets relating
to the carry-forward of unused tax losses are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
Current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the
sametaxation authority and when there is a legally enforceable right to offset them. Deferred income taxes
are determined based on the currently enacted tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction where the
Groupoperates.
Discontinued businesses and non-current assets held for sale
A discontinued business is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of
business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Reclassification as a discontinued business occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria
tobe classified as held for sale, if earlier.45
A disposal group is a group of assets that are to be disposed of as a group in a single transaction, together
with the liabilities directly associated with those assets that will be transferred in the transaction. The assets
and liabilities in a disposal group are reclassified as held for sale if their value will be recovered principally
through a sale rather than through continuing use. The disposal group must be available for sale in its current
condition and the sale must be highly probable.
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the measurement of all assets and liabilities in a disposal
group is updated in accordance with applicable accounting policies. Then, on initial classification as held for
sale, disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment
losses on initial classification as held for sale are included in the income statement.
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The original
purchase cost, consideration received for subsequent resale of these equity instruments and other
movements are reported as changes in equity. These instruments have been acquired primarily to meet the
potential obligations to employees that may arise in respect of certain of the Group’s equity compensation
plans.
Management judgements made in applying accounting policies
The application of the Group’s accounting policies may require management to make judgements, apart from
those involving estimates, that can have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated
financial statements. Management judgement is particularly required when assessing the substance of trans-
actions that have a complicated structure or legal form. These include, but are not limited to, the following
areas:
Revenue recognition | The nature of the Group’s business is such that many sales transactions do not
havea simple structure. Sales agreements may consist of multiple components occurring at different times.
The Group is also party to various out-licensing agreements, which can involve upfront and milestone
payments that may occur over several years. These agreements may also involve certain future obligations.
Revenue is only recognised when, in management’s judgement, the significant risks and rewards of ownership
have been transferred and when the Group does not retain continuing managerial involvement or effective
control over the goods sold or when the obligation has been fulfilled. For some transactions this can result in
cash receipts being initially recognised as deferred income and then released to income over subsequent
periods on the basis of the performance of the conditions specified in the agreement.
Consolidation of subsidiaries and associates | The Group periodically undertakes transactions that may
involve obtaining the right to control or significantly influence the operations of other companies. These
transactions include the acquisition of all or part of the equity of other companies, the purchase of certain
assets and assumption of certain liabilities and contingent liabilities of other companies, and entering into
alliance agreements with other companies. Also included are transactions involving Special Purpose Entities
and similar vehicles. In all such cases management makes an assessment as to whether the Group has
theright to control or significantly influence the other company’s operations, and based on this assessment
the other company is consolidated as a subsidiary or associated company. In making this assessment
management considers the underlying economic substance of the transaction and not only the contractual
terms.46
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Business combinations | Where the Group acquires control of another business, the consideration
transferred has to be allocated to the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
non-controlling interest in the acquired business, with any residual recorded as goodwill. This process
involves management making an assessment of the fair value of these items. Management judgement
is particularly involved in the recognition and measurement of the following items:
• Intellectual property. This may include patents, licences, trademarks and similar rights for currently
marketed products, and also the rights and scientific knowledge associated with projects that are currently
in research or development phases.
• Contingencies such as legal and environmental matters.
• Contingent consideration arrangements.
• The recoverability of any accumulated tax losses previously incurred by the acquired company.
In all cases management makes an assessment based on the underlying economic substance of the items
concerned, and not only on the contractual terms, in order to fairly present these items.
Leases | The Group is party to leasing arrangements, both as a lessee and as a lessor. The treatment
of leasing transactions in the financial statements is mainly determined by whether the lease is considered
tobe an operating lease or a finance lease. In making this assessment, management looks at the substance
ofthe lease, as well as the legal form, and makes a judgement about whether substantially all of the risks
andrewards of ownership are transferred. Arrangements which do not take the legal form of a lease but
thatnevertheless convey the right to use an asset are also covered by such assessments.
Key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income, expenses and related disclosures. The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on
historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in accounting
estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based,
orasa result of new information or more experience. Such changes are recognised in the period in
whichtheestimate is revised.
The key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk
ofcausing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next twelve months
are described below.
Revenue recognition | If the circumstances are such that the level of sales returns, and hence revenues,
cannot be reliably measured, then sales are only recognised when the right of return expires, which is
generally upon prescription of the products to patients. In order to estimate this, management uses publicly
available information about prescriptions as well as information provided by wholesalers and other
intermediaries.
Sales allowances | The Group has provisions and accruals for expected sales returns, charge-backs
andother rebates, including Medicaid in the United States and similar rebates in other countries, which
at31December 2009 total 1,062 million Swiss francs. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing
contractual or legislatively-mandated obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience. Management
believes that the total provisions and accruals for these items are adequate, based upon currently available
information. As these deductions are based on management estimates, they may be subject to change
as better information becomes available. Such changes that arise could impact the provisions and accruals
recognised in the balance sheet in future periods and consequently the level of sales recognised in the
income statement in future periods.47
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill | The Group has property,
plantand equipment with a carrying value of 17,697 million Swiss francs as disclosed in Note 12. Goodwill
hasacarrying value of 8,261 million Swiss francs (see Note 13) and intangible assets have a carrying value
of6,005million Swiss francs (see Note 14). All of these assets are reviewed annually for impairment
asdescribed above. To assess whether any impairment exists, estimates are made of the future cash flows
expected toresult from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal. Actual outcomes could vary
significantly from such estimates of discounted future cash flows. Factors such as changes in the planned
useof buildings, machinery or equipment, or closure of facilities, the presence or absence of competition,
technical obsolescence or lower than anticipated sales of products with capitalised rights could result in
shortened useful lives or impairment. Changes in the discount rates used could also lead to impairments.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits | Many of the Group’s employees participate in post-
employment defined benefit plans. The calculations of the recognised assets and liabilities from such plans
are based upon statistical and actuarial calculations. In particular the present value of the defined benefit
obligation is impacted by assumptions on discount rates used to arrive at the present value of future pension
liabilities, and assumptions on future increases in salaries and benefits. Furthermore, the Group’s independent
actuaries use statistically based assumptions covering areas such as future withdrawals of participants from
the plan and estimates of life expectancy. At 31 December 2009 the present value of the Group’s defined
benefit obligation is 11,267 million Swiss francs for funded plans and 3,486 million Swiss francs for unfunded
plans (see Note 10). The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to
changesin market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, longer or shorter life spans
ofparticipants, and other changes in the factors being assessed. These differences could impact the
assetsorliabilities recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Legal provisions | Group companies are party to various legal proceedings, including claims arising from
trade, and the most significant matters are described in Note 25. Legal provisions at 31 December 2009 total
549 million Swiss francs. Management believes that the total provisions for legal proceedings are adequate
based upon currently available information. However, given the inherent difficulties in estimating liabilities
inthis area, it cannot be guaranteed that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued.
Additional claims could be made which might not be covered by existing provisions or by insurance.
Therecan be no assurance that there will not be an increase in the scope of these matters or that any future
lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations will not be material. Such changes that arise could impact
theprovisions recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Environmental provisions | The Group has provisions for environmental remediation costs, which at
31December 2009 total 247 million Swiss francs, as disclosed in Note 25. The material components of the
environmental provisions consist of costs to fully clean and refurbish contaminated sites and to treat and
contain contamination at certain other sites. Future remediation expenses are affected by a number of
uncertainties that include, but are not limited to, the detection of previously unknown contaminated sites,
themethod and extent of remediation, the percentage of waste material attributable to the Group at the
remediation sites relative to that attributable to other parties, and the financial capabilities of the other
potentially responsible parties. Management believes that the total provisions for environmental matters are
adequate based upon currently available information. However, given the inherent difficulties in estimating
liabilities in this area, it cannot be guaranteed that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the
amountsaccrued. The effect of the resolution of environmental matters on the results of operations cannot
bepredicted due to uncertainty concerning both the amount and the timing of future expenditures.
Suchchanges that arise could impact the provisions recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.48
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Income taxes | At 31 December 2009 the net liability for current income taxes is 2,234 million Swiss francs
and the net asset for deferred income taxes is 1,474 million Swiss francs, as disclosed in Note 6. Significant
estimates are required to determine the current and deferred assets and liabilities for income taxes. Some
ofthese estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Management believes that
the estimates are reasonable and that the recognised liabilities for income tax-related uncertainties are
adequate. Various internal and external factors may have favourable or unfavourable effects on the income tax
assets and liabilities. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or
rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, future levels of research and development
spending and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. Such changes that arise could impact the assets
and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Changes in accounting policies
In 2007 the Group early adopted IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ and IAS 23 (revised) ‘Borrowing Costs’
whichwere required to be implemented from 1 January 2009 at the latest. In 2008 the Group early adopted
the revised versions of IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ and IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial
Statements’ which are required to be implemented from 1 January 2010 at the latest.
In 2009 the Group has implemented revisions to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ the effects of
which are described below. The Group has also implemented various other amendments to existing standards
and interpretations, which have no material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position.
IAS 1 (revised) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ | Amongst other matters, the revised standard
requires some changes to the format of the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in
equity and requires some additional disclosures in the Notes to the Financial Statements, notably disclosing
the pre-tax and tax impact of items of other comprehensive income (see Note 6). The balance sheet also
includes the opening balances as at the beginning of the comparative period, and this is also reflected in the
relevant Notes to the Financial Statements. The Group has also simplified the presentation of its equity by
reporting ‘own equity instruments’ together with ‘retained earnings’. The changes from the implementation
ofthe revised standard are purely presentational and have no impact on the Group’s overall results and
financial position.
The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of the other new and revised standards and
interpretations that will be effective from 1 January 2010 and beyond, and which the Group has not early
adopted. The Group does not anticipate that these will have a material impact on the Group’s overall
resultsand financial position.49

Supplementary information on sales by therapeutic areas in the Pharmaceuticals Division and by business
areas in the Diagnostics Division are given on pages 6—8 and 13—14 respectively. Sales are allocated to
geographical areas by destination according to the location of the customer. Royalties and other operating
income are allocated according to the location of the Group company that receives the revenue. European
Union information is based on members of the EU as at 31 December 2009.
Major customers
The US national wholesale distributor, AmerisourceBergen Corp., represented approximately 6 billion
Swissfrancs (2008: 6 billion Swiss francs) of the Group’s revenues. Approximately 82% of these revenues
were inthe Pharmaceuticals operating segment, with the residual in the Diagnostics segment. The Group
alsoreported substantial revenues from the US national wholesale distributors, Cardinal Health, Inc.
andMcKesson Corp., and in total these three customers represented approximately a quarter of the Group’s
revenues.
3. Genentech
Effective 7 September 1990 the Roche Group acquired a majority interest of approximately 60% of Genentech,
Inc., a biotechnology company in the United States. On 13 June 1999 the Group exercised its option to
acquire the remaining shares of Genentech on 30 June 1999, at which point Genentech became a 100%
owned subsidiary of the Group. On 23 July 1999, 26 October 1999 and 29 March 2000 the Group completed
public offerings of Genentech’s common stock, which reduced the Group’s majority interest to 60%.
The common stock of Genentech became publicly traded and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
under the symbol ‘DNA’. During 2004 the Group’s ownership of Genentech decreased by 2.45% due to the
conversion and redemption of the ‘LYONs IV’ US dollar exchangeable notes. At 31 December 2008 the
Group’s interest in Genentech was 55.8%.
Genentech transaction
On 21 July 2008 the Group announced a proposal to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Genentech
common stock not owned by Roche at a price of USD 89.00 in cash per share, equivalent to a total
cash payment of approximately 43.7 billion US dollars (the ‘Roche Proposal’). On 24 July 2008 Genentech
announced that a special committee of its Board of Directors composed of its independent directors
(the‘Special Committee’) had been formed to review, evaluate, and, at the Special Committee’s discretion,
negotiate and recommend or not recommend the acceptance of the Roche Proposal. On 13 August 2008
Genentech announced that the Special Committee did not support the proposal.
On 9 February 2009 Roche Investments USA Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, commenced
acash tender offer for the publicly-held Genentech shares at USD 86.50 per share. On 12 March 2009,
Roche entered into a merger agreement with Genentech pursuant to which the Group made a successful
tender offer to purchase all of the shares of Genentech not already owned by the Group for USD 95.00
pershare in cash (the ‘Genentech transaction’). As a result, Genentech became a wholly-owned subsidiary
ofthe Group, effective 26 March 2009.
The cash consideration for the purchase of all public shares, including shares issuable under Genentech’s
outstanding employee stock option plans and payment of related fees and expenses, amounted to
approximately 47 billion US dollars, as set out in the table below. These amounts have been recorded
toequity as a change in ownership interest in subsidiaries.52

The Group financed the Genentech transaction by a combination of the Group’s own funds, bonds, notes
andcommercial paper. The Group raised net proceeds of approximately 48.2 billion Swiss francs through
aseries of debt offerings, as described in Note 27. All newly issued debt is senior, unsecured and has been
guaranteed by Roche Holding Ltd.
The impacts of the Genentech transaction and the related reorganisation of Roche’s pharmaceuticals business
on the Group’s results are described in Note 8.
Genentech share repurchases
On 15 April 2008 Genentech’s Board of Directors approved an extension of the existing stock repurchase
programme authorising Genentech to repurchase up to 150 million shares of Genentech’s common stock for
atotal of 10 billion US dollars through 30 June 2009. Since the programme’s inception through 31 December
2008, Genentech had repurchased approximately 89 million shares for a total of approximately 6.5 billion
USdollars. During 2008 the net cash outflow from repurchases of Genentech common stock was 780 million
US dollars or 844 million Swiss francs. No repurchases were made during 2009.
4. Chugai
Effective 1 October 2002 the Roche Group and Chugai completed an alliance to create a leading research-
driven Japanese pharmaceutical company, which was formed by the merger of Chugai and Roche’s Japanese
pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Nippon Roche. The merged company, known as Chugai, is a fully consolidated
subsidiary of the Group. At 31 December 2009 the Group’s interest in Chugai was 61.6% (2008: 61.5%).
The common stock of Chugai is publicly traded and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the stock
code ‘TSE:4519’. Chugai prepares financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in Japan (JGAAP). These are filed on a quarterly basis with the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Roche’s relationship with Chugai
Chugai has entered into certain agreements with Roche, which are discussed below:
Basic Alliance Agreement | As part of the Basic Alliance Agreement signed in December 2001, Roche
andChugai entered into certain arrangements covering the future operation and governance of Chugai.
Amongst other matters these cover the following areas:
• The structuring of the alliance.
• Roche’s rights as a shareholder.
• Roche’s rights to nominate members of Chugai’s Board of Directors.
• Certain limitations to Roche’s ability to buy or sell Chugai’s common stock.53
Chugai issues additional shares of common stock in connection with its convertible debt and equity
compensation plans, and may issue additional shares for other purposes, which affects Roche’s percentage
ownership interest. The Basic Alliance Agreement provides, amongst other matters, that Chugai will
guaranteeRoche’s right to maintain its shareholding percentage in Chugai at not less than 50.1%.
Licensing Agreements | Under the Japan Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in December 2001, Chugai
hasexclusive rights to market Roche’s pharmaceutical products in Japan. Chugai also has first right of refusal
on the development and marketing in Japan of all development compounds advanced by Roche.
Under the Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in May 2002, Roche has the right of first
refusal on the development and marketing of Chugai’s development compounds in markets outside Japan,
excluding South Korea, if Chugai decides that it requires a partner for such activities.
Further to these agreements, Roche and Chugai have signed a series of separate agreements for certain
specific products. Depending on the specific circumstances and the terms of the agreement, this may result
inpayments on an arm’s-length basis between Roche and Chugai, for any or all of the following matters:
• Upfront payments, if a right of first refusal to license a product is exercised.
• Milestone payments, dependent upon the achievement of agreed performance targets.
• Royalties on future product sales.
These specific product agreements may also cover the manufacture and supply of the respective products
tomeet the other party’s clinical and/or commercial requirements on an arm’s-length basis.
Research Collaboration Agreements | Roche and Chugai have entered into research collaboration
agreements in the areas of small molecule synthetic drug research and biotechnology based drug discovery.
Dividends
The dividends distributed to third parties holding Chugai shares during 2009 totalled 87 million Swiss francs
(2008: 74 million Swiss francs) and have been recorded against non-controlling interests (see Note 30).
Dividends paid by Chugai to Roche are eliminated on consolidation as inter-company items.
Tender offer for Chugai shares
On 22 May 2008, the Group announced a tender offer to acquire additional common shares of Chugai
toincrease the Group’s ownership of Chugai’s issued shares from 50.1% to 59.9%. The tender offer was fully
subscribed at the offer price of 1,730 Japanese yen per share and on 24 June 2008 the Group acquired
54.9million common shares of Chugai for a cash consideration of 95.0 billion Japanese yen (912 million Swiss
francs). Taking into account the shares that had previously been repurchased by Chugai but not retired,
theGroup’s ownership in Chugai’s outstanding shares increased to 61.5%. The total cash outflow of
934 million Swiss francs, including directly attributable costs of 22 million Swiss francs, has been recorded
toequity as a change in ownership interest in subsidiaries.
Chugai share repurchases
During 2009 Chugai repurchased 640,800 of its common shares. As a result the Group’s ownership in
Chugaiincreased to 61.6% from 61.5%. The total cash outflow, including repurchases of fractional shares,
was1.2 billion Japanese yen (14 million Swiss francs). There were no share repurchases in 2008.
Other matters
Details of Chugai’s equity compensation plans are given in Note 11. Details of the ‘Series 6 Chugai
Pharmaceutical Unsecured Convertible Bonds’, of which the remaining outstanding bonds were fully redeemed
in 2008, are given in Note 27.54

Exceptional financing costs
As described in Note 3, effective 26 March 2009 the Group purchased all publicly owned shares of
Genentech for USD 95.00 per share in cash, with the total cash consideration of the transaction,
includingshares issuable under Genentech’s outstanding employee stock option plans and payment
ofrelatedfees and expenses, being approximately 52.7 billion Swiss francs.
In order to execute this transaction, the Group liquidated certain debt securities into cash. This resulted
inanet loss on these transactions of 238 million Swiss francs. Furthermore, due to the prevailing financial
conditions, the Group issued bonds and notes in advance of the transaction totalling 48.2 billion Swiss francs
through a series of debt offerings, as described in Note 27. The interest expense on these instruments for
thebridging period between their issue and the completion of the Genentech transaction on 26 March 2009
was 139 million Swiss francs.
These amounts are disclosed separately in the income statement in order to fairly present the Group’s
resultsin the overall context of the Genentech transaction and related reorganisations in the Group’s
Pharmaceuticals Division. The total income tax benefit recorded in respect of exceptional financing costs
was61 million Swiss francs.

Income taxes on exceptional items
As described in Note 8, the Group incurred exceptional expenses totalling 2,415 million Swiss francs in
connection with the Genentech transaction and the related reorganisations in the Group’s pharmaceuticals
business. Furthermore, as described in Note 5, the Group incurred exceptional financing costs totalling
377million Swiss francs in connection with the financing of the Genentech transaction. As disclosed
inNote25, expenses incurred in respect of major legal cases were 320 million Swiss francs (2008: income
of271 million Swiss francs). The income tax effects of these items in 2009, as shown in the table below,
are disclosed separately in the income statement in order to fairly present the Group’s results in the overall
context of the Genentech transaction and related reorganisations in the Group’s Pharmaceuticals Division.56
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
An income tax benefit of 207 million Swiss francs was recorded in respect of Genentech’s stock options
plansin 2009 following the increase in Genentech’s share price in 2009 prior to the completion of
the Genentech transaction. Of this income tax benefit, approximately 147 million Swiss francs are clearly
attributable to the Genentech transaction, and therefore has been allocated as part of exceptional income
taxes. This amount has been calculated as the difference between the income tax benefit calculated at
a share price of USD 86.50, being the price per share of Roche’s tender offer of 9 February 2009, and the
income tax benefit calculated at the final agreed tender offer price in the merger agreement at USD 95.00
pershare.

Since the Group operates internationally, it is subject to income taxes in many different tax jurisdictions.
TheGroup calculates its average expected tax rate as a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax
jurisdictions in which the Group operates. This rate changes from year to year due to changes in the mix of
the Group’s taxable income and changes in local tax rates. The average expected rate decreased in 2009
compared to 2008 with the main driver being the additional financing costs from the Genentech transaction
from 26 March 2009 onwards. The Group’s effective tax rate can be reconciled to the Group’s average
expected tax rate as follows:

Acquisitions — 2009
Lonza Singapore | In 2006 Genentech entered into a supply agreement for the manufacture of certain
Genentech products at a facility under construction in Singapore by Lonza Group Ltd. (‘Lonza’) which is
currently expected to receive US Food and Drug Administration (‘FDA’) licensure in 2010. Genentech
wascommitted to fund the pre-commissioning production qualification costs at this facility and, upon FDA
licensure, Genentech was committed to purchase 100% of products successfully manufactured at the facility
for a period of three years after commissioning of the facility. Genentech also received an exclusive option
topurchase Lonza’s Singapore facility during the period from 2007 up to one year after FDA licensure
forapurchase price of 290 million US dollars. Genentech also entered into a loan agreement with Lonza to
advance up to 299 million US dollars to Lonza for the construction of the Singapore facility. If Genentech
exercised its option to purchase the facility then any outstanding advances may be offset against the
purchase price. If Genentech did not exercise its purchase option then the advances may be offset against
supply purchases. Regardless of whether the purchase option is exercised, Genentech will be obliged
tomake a milestone payment of 70 million US dollars if certain performance milestones were met at the
facility being constructed.59
For accounting purposes, due to the nature of the supply agreement and Genentech’s involvement in
the construction of the buildings, Genentech has been considered to be the owner of the assets during the
construction period even though the funds to construct the building shell and some infrastructure costs
arepaid by Lonza. As at 31 December 2008, construction in progress totalling 284 million Swiss francs had
been capitalised and a liability for the financing obligation totalling 46 million Swiss francs had been recorded,
which is net of 225 million US dollars (238 million Swiss francs) that had been advanced by Genentech
toLonza.
On 28 August 2009 Genentech Singapore Pte. Ltd, (‘Genentech Singapore’) exercised the option to
purchase100% ownership in Lonza Biologics Singapore Pte. Ltd. (‘Lonza Singapore’). Lonza Singapore
isacell culture biologic manufacturing facility, which is mechanically complete. It is expected to produce
Avastin (bevacizumab) bulk drug substance, has 80,000 litres of fermentation capacity and is located
onapproximately 10 acres with an option for up to 20 additional acres. As part of the integration between
Roche’s and Genentech’s combined technical operations, the biotechnology production facilities in Singapore
have been merged and now operate under the name of Roche Singapore Technical Operations. With the
exercise of the option and resultant merger, approximately 230 Lonza employees joined Genentech Singapore
Technical Operations, for a total site headcount of approximately 325. As at 28 August 2009, under the
previous accounting treatment described above, construction in progress totalling 284 million US dollars
(301million Swiss francs) had been capitalised and a similar liability for the financing obligation had been
recorded. In addition 225 million US dollars had been advanced by Genentech to Lonza.
The transaction value was 376 million US dollars, which consists of 306 million US dollars for the Singapore
facility and 70 million US dollars of various milestone payments. Of this amount 225 million US dollars was
offset by loans previously made by Genentech to Lonza. The net transaction value was 151 million US dollars
(159 million Swiss francs), of which 108 million US dollars (114 million Swiss francs) was cash payments
in2009 and 43 million US dollars (46 million Swiss francs) in accrued milestone payments that will be made
in 2010. For accounting purposes, 94 million US dollars (99 million Swiss francs) was allocated to the settle-
ment of the existing financing obligation and 14 million US dollars (15 million Swiss francs) to the acquisition
oftheLonza Singapore business. This has been allocated as follows:

Other acquisitions | Effective 1 January 2009 the Group acquired an 89.6% controlling interest in Memory
Pharmaceuticals Corp. (‘Memory’), a publicly owned US company based in Montvale, New Jersey, that
hadbeen listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol ‘MEMY’. Memory develops innovative drug candidates
forthe treatment of debilitating central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and
schizophrenia. Memory is reported as part of the Pharmaceuticals operating segment. The acquisition
will further strengthen the Group’s research and development pipeline in areas such as Alzheimer’s disease.
The purchase consideration was 48 million Swiss francs, paid in cash.60
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
There were other minor business combinations in the Diagnostics business with a total purchase consideration
of 57 million Swiss francs, of which 55 million Swiss francs was in cash and 2 million Swiss francs from
a contingent consideration arrangement. A liability of 2 million Swiss francs was recognised at the acquisition
date, based on management’s best estimate at that time of the probability–adjusted expected cash outflow
from the arrangement. As at 31 December 2009 the amount recognised for this arrangement was reduced to
zero, based on the most recent management estimates.
The combined purchase consideration has been allocated as follows:

Subsequent to the effective date of the acquisition on 1 January 2009, the Group purchased the remaining
shares in Memory held by third parties to give the Group a 100% interest in Memory. The cash consideration
was 6 million Swiss francs, which has been recorded to equity as a change in ownership interest in
subsidiaries.
Goodwill represents a control premium and synergies that can be obtained from the Group’s existing
business. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The fair value of other net assets (liabilities) includes receivables with a fair value of 4 million Swiss francs
which includes an allowance for doubtful accounts of 1 million Swiss francs.
Directly attributable acquisition-related costs of 2 million Swiss francs were incurred in these acquisitions.
These are reported within general and administration expenses in the current period as part of the operating
result of the Pharmaceuticals operating segment (1 million Swiss francs) and the Diagnostics operating
segment (1 million Swiss francs).61

Acquisitions — 2008
Ventana | Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. (‘Ventana’), a publicly owned US company based in Tucson,
Arizona that had been listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol ‘VMSI’. Prior to 8 February 2008, the Group
owned shares in Ventana representing 0.4% of the outstanding shares of Ventana. Effective 8 February 2008
the Group acquired a further 70.5% of the outstanding shares of Ventana and obtained control of Ventana.

Goodwill represents the strategic value to the Group of entering the tissue diagnostics business area.
Italsorepresents the premium paid over the traded market price to obtain control of the business. None
ofthe goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The non-controlling
interests in Ventana were measured at their proportionate share (29.1%) of Ventana’s identifiable net assets.
The fair value of other net assets (liabilities) includes receivables with a fair value of 117 million Swiss francs.
Included within this fair value is an allowance for doubtful trade accounts receivable of 2 million Swiss francs.
Finance lease receivables totalling 9 million Swiss francs are also included in this total and the gross amount
due under these contracts is 9 million Swiss francs.
The Group recognised a gain of 5 million Swiss francs as a result of measuring at fair value its 0.4% equity
interest in Ventana held prior to the acquisition date. This gain is included in financial income for 2008.
Directly attributable acquisition-related costs of 41 million Swiss francs were incurred in the transaction.
These are reported within general and administration expenses in the current period as part of the
operatingresult of the Diagnostics operating segment.
Subsequent to the effective date of the acquisition on 8 February 2008, the Group purchased the remaining
shares in Ventana held by third parties to give the Group a 100% interest in Ventana. The cash consideration
was 1,285 million Swiss francs, which has been recorded to equity as a change in ownership interest in

isoforms of PI3-K enzymes that are increasingly recognised as key players in a wide variety of disease
processes. Piramed is reported as part of the Pharmaceuticals operating segment. The acquisition will further
strengthen the Group’s research and development pipeline in oncology and inflammatory disease. The
purchase consideration was 183 million Swiss francs. This consisted of 176 million Swiss francs paid in cash
and 7 million Swiss francs from a contingent consideration arrangement. The contingent consideration
arrangement consists of a potential milestone payment of 15 million US dollars which is due upon the
commencement of phase II clinical trials for Piramed’s oncology programme. A liability of 7 million US dollars
(7 million Swiss francs) was recognised at the acquisition date, based on management’s best estimate at
thattime of the probability–adjusted expected cash outflow from the arrangement. As at 31 December 2009
the amount recognised for this arrangement was increased to 15 million US dollars (16 million Swiss francs)
based on the most recent management estimates, and consequently an additional 8 million Swiss francs
charge was recorded in the 2009 operating results.63
Effective 24 September 2008 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in ARIUS Research Inc.
(‘ARIUS’), a publicly owned Canadian biotechnology company that had been listed on the TSX under the

8. Changes in Group organisation
As described in Note 3, on 21 July 2008 the Group announced an offer to purchase all outstanding shares
ofGenentech. Following the closing of a transaction, Genentech’s South San Francisco site would become
theheadquarters of the Group’s combined pharmaceuticals operations in the United States. On 21 July 2008
the Group also announced that Roche’s pharmaceuticals business in the US would close manufacturing
operations at its site in Nutley, New Jersey, and commercial operations would be moved to Genentech.
Theresearch site at Palo Alto, California, would be closed with the research activities being transferred to
Nutley and to Genentech. Subsequent to these announcements, initial restructuring activities started
attheNutley and Palo Alto sites in 2008.
The Genentech transaction was completed effective 26 March 2009. Following this the Pharmaceuticals
Division initiated a detailed integration programme to align the Genentech business and the rest of
theRoche’s pharmaceuticals business. Genentech’s South San Francisco site is being established as the
headquarters of the pharmaceuticals business in the US, including commercial operations for the US market.
Genentech Research and Early Development is being set up as an autonomous unit while Genentech’s
late-stage development activities are being integrated with the global Pharmaceuticals Division network.
Theintegration programme includes prioritising projects within the shared portfolio and eliminating activities
that are either duplicated or no longer required, notably in the administration function.
Following the completion of the transaction, the Pharmaceuticals Division carried out a detailed reassessment
of its global manufacturing network, with particular emphasis on its biotech manufacturing facilities. As a
result several manufacturing facilities and construction projects are being discontinued, notably a bulk drug
production unit on part of the site at Vacaville in California.
The Group currently anticipates that these restructuring activities will be substantially completed by the
endof 2010. The total cost is expected to be in the order of 3.4 billion Swiss francs, which includes 243 mil-
lion Swiss francs that were incurred in 2008. Approximately 2.2 billion Swiss francs of this total is non-cash.
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment was reduced by 1.2 billion Swiss francs by the end
of2009, and is anticipated to be reduced by approximately 1.5 billion Swiss francs in total by the end of 2010,
mostly relating to manufacturing facilities.
Significant costs were incurred as described below. These are disclosed separately in the income statement
due to the materiality of the amounts and in order to fairly present the Group’s results. Costs of other
restructuring programmes that are less material and do not fundamentally change the Group’s organisation
are expensed in the current period and reported within the respective functional expense.65

The total income tax benefit recorded in respect of changes in Group organisation was 964 million Swiss francs
(2008: 93 million Swiss francs).
Genentech Employee Retention Program | On 18 August 2008 Genentech announced a broad-based
employee retention program, consisting of two retention plans that together cover substantially all employees
of the company. The program was estimated to cost approximately 375 million US dollars payable in cash
andhas been implemented in lieu of Genentech’s 2008 annual stock option grant. Total expenses for
theretention program in 2009 were 192 million Swiss francs (2008: 146 million Swiss francs). If Genentech
had granted an annual stock option award, as in previous years, with the same total value as the retention
program then the costs would have been expensed over the four-year vesting period and the amount
expensed in 2009 would have been approximately 192 million Swiss francs (2008: 52 million Swiss francs).
Accordingly the additional incremental costs incurred for the retention plan are reported as part of changes
inGroup organisation, since these are directly attributable to the Genentech transaction.

10. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group’s objective is to provide attractive and competitive post-employment benefits to employees, while
at the same time ensuring that the various plans are appropriately financed and managing any potential
impacts on the Group’s long-term financial position. Most employees are covered by pension plans sponsored
by Group companies. The nature of such plans varies according to legal regulations, fiscal requirements
andmarket practice in the countries in which the employees are employed. Other post-employment benefits
consist mostly of post-retirement healthcare and life insurance schemes, principally in the United States.
Post-employment benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or
constructive obligation to pay further contributions. All other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’,
even if the Group’s potential obligation is relatively minor or has a relatively remote possibility of arising.
Consequently most of the Group’s post-employment benefit plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’
forthe purpose of these financial statements.67
Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans typically consist of payments by employees and by the Group to funds
administered by third parties. Payments by the Group were 295 million Swiss francs (2008: 253 million Swiss
francs). No assets or liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet in respect of such plans,
apartfrom regular prepayments and accruals of the contributions withheld from employees’ wages and
salaries and of the Group’s contributions.
Defined benefit plans
The Group’s major defined benefit plans are located in Switzerland, the United States, Germany, the United
Kingdom and Japan. Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded
by payments from the Group and by employees. In some cases, notably for the major defined benefit plans
inGermany, the plan is unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own
financial resources.
Current and past service costs are charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating
results. Pension plan administration and funding is overseen at a corporate level, and any settlement gains
and losses resulting from changes in funding arrangements are reported as general and administration
expenses within the Corporate segment. The expected returns on plan assets and interest costs are charged
to financial income and financing costs, respectively. Actuarial gains and losses are recorded directly in
equity. The recognition of pension assets is limited to the total of the present value of any future refunds from
the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans and any cumulative unrecognised past service
costs. Adjustments arising from the limit on the recognition of assets for defined benefit plans are recorded
directly in equity.

The funding of the Group’s various defined benefit plans is overseen at a corporate level. Qualified
independent actuaries carry out valuations on a regular basis and for major plans annually as at the reporting
date. For funded plans, which are usually trusts independent of the Group’s finances, the net asset/liability
recognised on the Group’s balance sheet corresponds to the over/under funding of the plan, adjusted for
unrecognised past service costs. For unfunded plans, where the Group meets the pension obligations directly
from its own financial resources, a liability for the defined benefit obligation is recorded in the Group’s
balance sheet. Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless the Group
has a legally enforceable right to use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan.
Amountsrecognised in the balance sheet for post-employment benefits are predominantly non-current
andare reported in non-current assets and liabilities.68

Actuarial assumptions
Actuarial assumptions are unbiased and mutually compatible estimates of variables that determine the
ultimate cost of providing post-employment benefits. They are set on an annual basis by local management
and actuaries and are subject to approval by corporate management and the Group’s actuaries. Actuarial
assumptions consist of demographic assumptions on matters such as mortality and employee turnover,
andfinancial assumptions on matters such as salary and benefit levels, interest rates, return on investments
and costs of medical benefits. The Group operates defined benefit plans in many countries and the actuarial
assumptions vary based upon local economic and social conditions.
Demographic assumptions | The most significant demographic assumptions relate to mortality rates.
TheGroup’s actuaries use mortality tables which take into account historic patterns and expected changes,
such as further increases in longevity. The mortality tables used for the major schemes are:
• Germany: Heubeck tables 2005G.
• Japan: National Census (No. 20 Life Table).
• Switzerland: BVG 2005.
• United Kingdom: non-pensioners — S1NA_L table rated up 1.5 years (male) and 0.5 years (female).
Futureimprovements: medium cohort (from 2002) with a 1% underpin (from 2009)
• United Kingdom: pensioners — S1NA_L table rated up 1.5 years. Future improvements: medium cohort
(from 2002) with a 1% underpin (from 2009).
• United States: RP2000 projected to 2010.
Rates of employee turnover, disability and early retirement are based on historical behaviour within Group
companies.
Financial assumptions | These are based on market expectations for the period over which the obligations
are to be settled. The ranges of assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the most significant plans,
which are in countries with stable currencies and interest rates, are shown below.70
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements

Medical cost trend rate 8.19% 7.80%—8.20% 8.76% 7.90%—8.80%
Discount rates, which are used to calculate the discounted present value of the defined benefit obligation,
are determined with reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds, or government bonds
incountries where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. The currency and term of the bonds is
consistent with the obligation being discounted. The interest cost included in the income statement
is calculated by multiplying the discount rate by the defined benefit obligation.
Expected returns on plan assets are based on market expectations of expected returns on the assets in
funded plans over the duration of the related obligation. This takes into account the split of the plan assets
between equities, bonds, property and other investments. The calculation includes assumptions concerning
expected dividend and interest income, realised and unrealised gains on plan assets and taxes and
administration costs borne by the plan. These arebased on long-term market expectations and the actual
performance is continually monitored by corporate management. Due to the long-term nature of the obliga-
tions, the assumptions used for matters such as returns on investments may not necessarily be consistent
with recent historical patterns. The expected return on plan assets included in the income statement is
calculated by multiplying the expected rate of return by the fair value of plan assets. The difference between
the expected return and the actual return in any twelve month period is an actuarial gain/loss and
isrecordeddirectly to equity. The actual return on plan assets was a gain of 1,191 million Swiss francs
(2008:loss of 2,107 million Swiss francs).
Expected rates of salary increases, which are used to calculate the defined benefit obligation and the current
service cost included in the income statement, are based on the latest expectation and historical behaviour
within Group companies.
Medical cost trend rates are used to calculate the defined benefit obligation and the current service cost
included inthe income statement of post-employment medical plans. These take into account the benefits set
out in the plan terms and expected future changes in medical costs. Since the Group’s major post-
employment medical plans are forUS employees, these rates are driven by developments in the United States.
The effect of one percentage point increase or decrease in the medical cost trend rate is shown below.

Based on the most recent actuarial valuations, the Group expects that employer contributions for funded
plans in 2010 will be approximately 183 million Swiss francs, which includes an estimated 13 million Swiss
francs of additional contributions. Benefits paid for unfunded plans are estimated to be approximately
137 million Swiss francs.
Amounts recorded in equity
The actuarial gains and losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income were losses of 69 million
Swiss francs (2008: losses of 2,820 million Swiss francs), pre-tax. The total amount at 31 December 2009
wasan accumulated loss of 1,502 million Swiss francs (2008: accumulated loss of 1,433 million Swiss francs).
In addition the recognition of pension assets is limited to the total of the present value of any future refunds
from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans and the cumulative unrecognised past
servicecosts. Adjustments arising from this limit on asset recognition are recorded directly in equity. In 2009
this adjustment was a decrease of 3 million Swiss francs (2008: increase of 636 million Swiss francs).72

11. Employee stock options and other equity compensation
benefits
The Group operates several equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Genentech (prior to
the Genentech transaction) and Chugai. Effective 1 January 2005 the Group adopted IFRS 2 ‘Share-based
Payment’. Amongst other matters, the standard requires that the fair value of all equity compensation plan
awards granted to employees be estimated at grant date and recorded as an expense over the vesting period.
The expense is charged against the appropriate income statement heading.

The net cash outflow from transactions in own equity instruments arises from sales and purchases of non-
voting equity securities (Genussscheine)and derivative instruments thereon which are held for the Group’s
potential conversion obligations that may arise from the Group’s equity-settled equity compensation plans.
These derivative instruments mainly consist of call options that are exercisable at any time up to their maturity
(see Note 28).
In addition to the above cash flows, upon the completion of the Genentech transaction the remaining
outstanding Genentech employee stock options were fully redeemed for cash. The resulting cash outflow
was2,704 million Swiss francs, which was reported as a change in ownership interest in subsidiaries
(seeNote 3).
Roche Long-Term | During 2005 the Group implemented a new global long-term incentive programme
whichis available to certain directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group.
The programme consists of Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (‘S-SARs’), with the Group having
thealternative of granting awards under the existing Roche Option Plan. In 2009, following the integration
ofGenentech, the Group also established a Restricted Stock Unit (‘RSU’) plan. The first awards of this
planwere made in September 2009 to employees at Genentech. The S-SARs are issued in accordance with
the Roche S-SAR Plan (the Regulations of 1 January 2005 including amendments effective as of 1 January
2007 and the addenda, including the Roche S-SAR Plan’s 2009 Addendum United States as of 1 September
2009). The Remuneration Committee determines the number of non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
that will be available under the plan each year. The above regulations collectively provide that 60 million
non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)will be available for issuance under the Roche S-SAR Plan
overa ten-year period. The RSUs are issued in accordance with the Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan
(theRegulations effective 1 September 2009), under which 10 million non-voting equity securities (Genuss-
scheine)will be available for issuance over a ten-year period. Further details of both plans are given in
the relevant sections below. Within the meaning of Section 25102(o) of Title 4 of the California Corporations
Codeand Sections 260.140.41 and 260.140.42 of Title 10 of the California Code of Regulations, approval
of these Consolidated Financial Statements constitutes approval of the Roche S-SAR Plan and the Roche
Restricted Stock Unit Plan, each of which is described in these Consolidated Financial Statements, by a
majority of Roche Holding Ltd’s outstanding securities entitled to vote.74
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Share option plans
Roche Option Plan | Awards under this plan give employees the right to purchase non-voting equity
securities (Genussscheine)at an exercise price specified at the grant date. The options, which are
non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years,
subject to continued employment. The Group covers such obligations by purchasing non-voting equity
securities or derivatives thereon (see Note 28). With the introduction of Roche Long-Term in 2005,
the number of options granted under the Roche Option Plan was significantly reduced, as most eligible
employees now receive Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights instead.

Genentech Stock Option Plan | The Genentech Stock Option Plan was adopted in 1999 and amended
thereafter. In April 2004 Genentech’s shareholders approved an equity incentive plan. The plans allow for the
granting of various stock options, incentive stock options and stock purchase rights to employees, directors
and consultants of Genentech. The options granted, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, had
a ten-year duration and vested on a phased basis over four years, subject to continued employment. Upon the
completion of the Genentech transaction (see Notes 3 and 8) the remaining outstanding options were fully
redeemed for cash. For accounting purposes the remaining fair value was expensed for the options that were
not fully vested at that time, as described in Note 8.75

Volatility for Roche and Chugai options was determined primarily by reference to historically observed prices
of the underlying equity. Volatility for Genentech options was determined primarily by reference to the implied
volatility of Genentech’s traded options. Risk-free interest rates are derived from zero coupon swap rates
atthe grant date taken from Datastream. The early exercise factor describes the ratio between the expected
market price at the exercise date and the exercise price at which early exercises can be expected, based
onhistorically observed behaviour.
Other equity compensation plans
Special Stock Awards | In March and December 2009 the Group issued Special Stock Awards to certain
directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The awards consist of
immediately vesting non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine). The fair value of the awards was calculated
on the basis of the market value of Roche non-voting equity securities at the date of issue.

Roche Connect | This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the United States
and certain other countries, to make regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting equity
securities (Genussscheine). It is administered by independent third parties. The Group contributes to
the programme, which allows the employees to purchase non-voting equity securities at a discount (usually
20%). The administrator purchases the necessary non-voting equity securities directly from the market.
At31December 2009 the administrator held 1.6 million non-voting equity securities (2008: 1.4 million).
Theprogramme has been operational since 1 October 2002. During the year the cost of the plan was
13 million Swiss francs (2008: 13 million Swiss francs), which was reported within the relevant expenditure
line by function.77
Genentech Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP) | Genentech had an employee stock purchase
programme that allowed employees to purchase Genentech’s common stock at 85% of the lower of market
value at the grant date or purchase date. In 2009 a total of 0.4 million shares of Genentech common stock
were purchased (2008: 1.8 million shares) resulting in a cash inflow of 27 million Swiss francs (2008:
115 million Swiss francs). During the year the cost of the plan was 37 million Swiss francs (2008: 33 million
Swiss francs), which was reported within the relevant expenditure line by function. Upon the completion
ofthe Genentech transaction (see Notes 3 and 8) the remaining outstanding awards were fully redeemed for
cash. For accounting purposes the remaining fair value was expensed for the awards that were not fully
vested at that time, as described in Note 8.
Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights | With the introduction of Roche Long-Term in 2005,
theGroup offers Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) to certain directors, management and
employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The S-SARs give employees the right to receive non-
votingequity securities (Genussscheine)reflecting the value of any appreciation in the market price of the
non-voting equity securities between the grant date and the exercise date. The rights, which are non-tradable
equity-settled awards, have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years, subject
tocontinued employment. The Group covers such obligations by purchasing non-voting equity securities,
orderivatives thereon (see Note 28).

The weighted average fair value of the rights granted in 2009 was calculated using a binomial model.
The inputs to the model were consistent with those used for the Roche Option Plan 2009 awards given
previously, except that the early exercise factor was 1.379 and the expected exit rate was 7.1%.
The resulting weighted average fair value per right is CHF 17.67 giving a total fair value of 253 million
Swiss francs which is charged over the vesting period of three years.78
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan | For the first time in September 2009 the Group issued Restricted Stock
Units (RSUs) awards to certain directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the
Group. These first awards were made only to employees at Genentech. The RSUs, which are non-tradable,
represent the right to receive non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)which vest only after a three year
period. The weighted average fair value of the awards granted in 2009 was CHF 147.22 calculated on the
basis of the market value of Roche non-voting equity securities at the date of issue, discounted to take into
account that the awards would not accrue for any dividends during the vesting period.

Chugai Retirement Stock Acquisition Rights | For the first time in 2009 Chugai issued stock acquisition
rights in lieu of the abolition of the Retirement Gratuities System for Directors. The 785 rights issued have
athirty-year duration and vest upon the holder’s retirement as a director of Chugai. Each right entitles
theholder to purchase 100 Chugai shares at an exercise price of 100 Japanese yen. The total fair value of
rights issued was equivalent to 1 million Swiss francs, which was calculated using a binomial model with
inputs consistent with those used for the Chugai Stock Appreciation Rights given previously.
Roche Performance Share Plan | The Group offers future non-voting equity security awards (or, at the
discretion of the Board of Directors, their cash equivalent) to certain directors and key senior managers.
Theprogramme was established at the beginning of 2002 and currently operates in annual three-year cycles.
The terms of the currently outstanding awards are set out in the table below. The amount of non-voting equity
securities allocated will depend upon the individual’s salary level, the achievement of performance targets
linked to the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (shares and non-voting equity securities combined) relative
tothe Group’s peers during the three-year period from the date of the grant, and the discretion of the Board
of Directors. These are non-tradable equity-settled awards. Each award will result in between zero and two
non-voting equity securities, depending upon the achievement of the performance targets.

The weighted average fair value of the awards granted in 2009 was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation.
The input parameters to the model were the covariance matrix between Roche and the other individual
companies of the peer group based on a three-year history and a risk-free rate of 1.44%. The valuation also
takes into account the defined rank and performance structure which determines the payout of the PSP.
Roche Stock Appreciation Rights | Some employees of certain North American subsidiaries of the Group
receive Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) as part of their compensation. The SARs, which are non-tradable
cash-settled awards, may be exercised after a vesting period of between one and three years for a cash
payment, based upon the amount by which the market price of the Group’s American Depositary Receipts
(ADRs) at the point of exercise exceeds the strike price (grant price at issuance). Following the implementation
of Roche Long-Term (see above), the Group does not plan to award any further cash-settled SARs and
noawards have been made since 2004. On 9 January 2009 the ratio of ADRs to non-voting equity securities
(Genussscheine)was changed from 2:1 to 4:1. The information below has been restated for this change.

Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from
theuse of the asset and its eventual disposal. Factors such as changes in the planned use of buildings,
machinery or equipment, or closure of facilities, the presence or absence of competition and technical obso-
lescence could result in shortened useful lives or impairment. Impairment charges of 30 million Swiss francs
(2008: 18million Swiss francs) are reported as part of ‘Cost of sales’,14 million Swiss francs (2008: zero)
in‘Research and development’ and 1,083 million Swiss francs (2008: 10 million Swiss francs) are reported
aspart of ‘Changes in Group organisation’ (see Note 8). The major part of the impairment reported in
‘Changes in Group organisation’ relates to the discontinuation of a bulk drug production unit on part of the
site at Vacaville in California, which was fully written-down.81
Borrowing costs totalling 9 million Swiss francs using a rate of 4.79% (2008: 42 million Swiss francs using
arate of 4.79%) were capitalised as property, plant and equipment.
Leasing arrangements where the Group is the lessee
Finance leases | As at 31 December 2009 the capitalised cost of property, plant and equipment under
finance leases was 157 million Swiss francs (2008: 174 million Swiss francs) and the net book value of these
assets was 43 million Swiss francs (2008: 53 million Swiss francs).

Genentech leasing arrangements
In December 2004 Genentech entered into a Master Lease Agreement with Slough SSF LLC, which
was subsequently acquired by Health Care Properties (‘HCP’) for the development of property adjacent to
Genentech’s South San Francisco site. The development includes a total of eight buildings, which are
subjectto separate agreements as contemplated by the Master Lease Agreement. HCP as the developer will
construct the building shell for each building and Genentech will finish the interior of each building as
laboratory or office space, as applicable. The construction of the first buildings was completed in 2006,
atwhich point the lease term for those buildings was deemed to begin. Construction of the final buildings
was completed during 2008. The lease term expires twelve years from the occupation of the final building.
Genentech has two five-year renewal options for each building and has an option to purchase the various
buildings at different dates between 2016 and 2020. Genentech also has a right of first refusal with respect
toeach building or the entire development should HCP consider selling part or all of the development.
As at 31 December 2009 the total carrying value of property, plant and equipment from this agreement
was213 million Swiss francs (2008: 239 million Swiss francs) and the carrying value of the leasing obligation
was 273 million Swiss francs (2008: 291 million Swiss francs). Estimates of the total future minimum lease
payments anticipated by the entire Master Lease Agreement are shown below.

There are no accumulated impairment losses in goodwill. The goodwill arising from investments in associates
is classified as part of the investments in associates (see Note 15).
Goodwill impairment testing
Pharmaceuticals Division | The division’s sub-divisions are the cash-generating units used for the testing
ofgoodwill. For Chugai, the recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs to sell, determined with
reference to the publicly quoted share prices of Chugai shares. For Roche Pharmaceuticals, the recoverable
amount used in the impairment testing is based on value in use. The cash flow projections used are based
onthe most recent business plans approved by management. These assume no significant changes in
theorganisation of the division and include management’s latest estimates on sales volume and pricing,
and production and other operating costs. These reflect past experience and are projected over five years.
Thecash flow projections used do not extend beyond management’s most recent business plans. The
discount rate used is based on a rate of 7.7%, which is derived from a capital asset pricing model using
datafrom Swiss capital markets, including Swiss Federal Government ten-year bonds and the Swiss Market
Index. A weighted average tax rate of 25.5% is used in the calculations. Management believes that any
reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would not cause the carrying value of goodwill
toexceed the recoverable amount.84
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Diagnostics Division | The division’s business areas are the cash-generating units used for the testing of
goodwill. The goodwill arising from the Corange/Boehringer Mannheim acquisition and part of the goodwill
from the Ventana acquisition is recorded and monitored at a divisional level as it relates to the strategic
development of the whole division and cannot be meaningfully allocated to the division’s business areas.
Therefore the cash-generating unit for this goodwill is the entire division. The recoverable amount used
intheimpairment testing is based on value in use. The cash flow projections used are based on the most
recent business plans approved by management. These assume no significant changes in the organisation of
the division and include management’s latest estimates on sales volume and pricing, and production and
other operating costs. These reflect past experience and are projected over five years. The estimates for the
Tissue Diagnostics business area are projected over ten years, which management believes reflects the
long-term nature of this business. The cash flow projections used do not extend beyond management’s most
recent business plans. The discount rate used is based on a rate of 7.7%, which is derived from a capital
assetpricing model using data from Swiss capital markets, including Swiss Federal Government ten-year
bonds and the Swiss Market Index. A weighted average tax rate of 25.5% is used in the calculations.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would not cause
the carrying value of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.

Internally generated intangible assets
The Group currently has no internally generated intangible assets from development as the criteria for the
recognition as an asset are not met.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
The Group currently has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Impairment of intangible assets
Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the
use of the asset and its eventual disposal. Factors such as the presence or absence of competition, technical
obsolescence or lower than anticipated sales for products with capitalised rights could result in shortened
useful lives or impairment.
2009 | In 2009 the Pharmaceuticals operating segment recorded an impairment charge of 588 million Swiss
francs and the Diagnostics operating segment recorded an impairment charge of 80 million Swiss francs.
In the Pharmaceuticals operating segment an impairment charge of 286 million Swiss francs was recorded
related to the Pharmaceuticals Division reorganisation (see Note 8). The integration programme includes
prioritising projects within the shared portfolio. The assets concerned were fully written down by these
charges. An impairment charge of 286 million Swiss francs was also recorded in respect of product intangibles
not available for use and follows from recent clinical data and portfolio prioritisation decisions relating
to certain projects either with alliance partners or acquired in business combinations. The assets concerned,
which were not yet being amortised, were written down to their recoverable amount of 321 million Swiss
francs, based on a value in use calculation using a discount rate of 7.7%. In addition an impairment charge
of16 million Swiss francs was recorded relating to intangible assets in use. These followed the regular
updating of the division’s business plans and technology assessments in the second half of 2009. The assets
were written down to their recoverable amount of 66 million Swiss francs, based on a value in use calculation
using a discount rate of 7.7%.
In the Diagnostics operating segment an impairment charge of 80 million Swiss francs was recorded.
Thiswasin respect of intangibles assets in use and followed the regular updating of the division’s business
plans and technology assessments in the second half of 2009. The assets were written down to their
recoverable amount of 71 million Swiss francs, based on a value in use calculation using a discount rate
of7.7%.
2008 | In the Pharmaceuticals operating segment an impairment charge of 30 million Swiss francs was
recorded in the first half of 2008 and a further 69 million Swiss francs were recorded in the second half of
2008. These relate to product intangibles not available for use and follow from decisions to terminate
development of three compounds with alliance partners. The assets concerned, which were not yet being
amortised, were fully written down by these charges. In the Diagnostics operating segment an impairment
charge of 5 million Swiss francs was recorded in the second half of 2008 relating to product intangible assets
in use. These followed the regular updating of the division’s business plans and technology assessments in
the second half of 2008. The assets were written down to their recoverable amount of 13 million Swiss francs,
based on a value in use calculation using a discount rate of 8.4%.
Intangible assets that are not yet available for use mostly represent in-process research and development
assets acquired either through in-licensing arrangements, business combinations or separate purchases.
Asat 31 December 2009 the carrying value of such assets in the Pharmaceuticals Division is 1,760 million
Swiss francs. Of this amount approximately 52% represents projects that have potential decision points
withinthe next twelve months which in certain circumstances could lead to impairment. Due to the inherent
uncertainties in the research and development process, such assets are particularly at risk of impairment
iftheproject in question does not result in a commercialised product.87
Potential commitments from alliance collaborations
The Group is party to in-licensing and similar arrangements with its alliance partners. These arrangements
may require the Group to make certain milestone or other similar payments dependent upon the achievement
of agreed objectives or performance targets as defined in the collaboration agreements.
The Group’s current estimate of future third-party commitments for such payments is set out in the table
below. These figures are not risk adjusted, meaning that they include all such potential payments that
canarise assuming all projects currently in development are successful. The timing is based on the Group’s
current best estimate. These figures do not include any potential commitments within the Group, such as
mayarise between the Roche and Chugai businesses.

Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Financial long-term assets are held for strategic purposes and are classified as non-current. The available-
for-sale investments are mainly equity investments. Unquoted equity investments classified as available-
for-sale are generally measured at cost, as their fair value cannot be measured reliably. These are primarily
investments in private biotechnology companies, which are kept as part of the Group’s strategic alliance
efforts. The carrying value of equity investments held at cost is 34 million Swiss francs (2008: 25 million Swiss
francs, 2007: 26 million Swiss francs). The average effective interest rate of held-to-maturity investments is
0.2% (2008: 2.5%). Loans receivable comprise all loans to third parties with a term of over one year.

Hedge accounting
The Group’s accounting policy on hedge accounting, which is described in Note 1, requires that to qualify for
hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability
of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
As described in Note 32, the Group has financial risk management policies for foreign exchange risk, interest
rate risk, market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. When deemed appropriate, certain of the above risks are
managed by using derivatives. While many of these transactions can be considered as hedges in economic
terms, if the required conditions are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting.
Inthis case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no
hedging relationship, which means that any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value
included in financial income.
The Group generally limits the use of hedge accounting to certain significant transactions. Consequently
asat31 December 2009 the Group has no fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investment
in a foreign entity that meet the strict requirements to qualify for hedge accounting, apart from those
described below.92
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Cash flow hedges
The Group has issued bonds and notes to finance the Genentech transaction (see Note 27). On some of the
bonds and notes which are denominated in euros and sterling, the Group has entered into cross-currency
swaps to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk. These cash flow hedges qualify for hedge accounting.
As at 31 December 2009 such instruments, which are designated and qualify for hedge accounting,
arerecorded as assets with a fair value of 1,698 million Swiss francs. There was no ineffective portion.
In 2008 Genentech had partly hedged non-US dollar cash flows from future royalty income and development
expenses expected over the next one to five years. Genentech entered into zero-cost collar option contracts.
As at 31 December 2008, none of the options were in-the-money, hence no cash flows were expected from
these derivatives. The options, which are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, were recorded as a
net liability with a fair value of 11 million Swiss francs. Those hedges were unwound during 2009. There was
no material ineffective portion.
The expected undiscounted cash flows from qualifying cash flow hedges, including interest payments during
the duration of the derivative contract and final settlement on maturity, are shown in the table below.

Fair value hedges
The Group has hedged some of its fixed-term debt instruments with interest rate swaps. As at 31 December
2009 such instruments, which have been designated and qualify as fair value hedges, are recorded in the
balance sheet as an asset with a fair value of 11 million Swiss francs (2008: asset of 20 million Swiss francs).
During 2009 a loss of 9 million Swiss francs was recorded on these interest rate swaps (2008: gain of
14 million Swiss francs). As the fair value hedge has been highly effective since inception, the result of the
interest rate swaps is largely offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt instruments.
The Group has equity investments in various biotechnology companies that are subject to a greater risk
ofmarket fluctuation than the stock market in general. To manage part of this exposure the Group has entered
into forward contracts, which have been designated and qualify as fair value hedges. As at 31 December
2009 such instruments are recorded as assets with a fair value of 20 million Swiss francs (2008: assets
of42million Swiss francs). During 2009 a loss of 22 million Swiss francs was recorded on these forward
contracts (2008: gain of 19 million Swiss francs). The result of the forward contracts is offset by the
changesin the fair value of the hedged equity investments.
The Group uses other derivatives, not designated in a qualifying hedge relationship, to manage its exposures
to foreign currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. The instruments used may include interest
rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, forwards contracts, options.

Major legal cases
Income (expense) from major legal cases is disclosed separately in the income statement due to the materiality
of the amounts and in order to fairly present the Group’s results. In 2009 provisions for major legal cases
were increased by 320 million Swiss francs, based on management’s current estimates of the ultimate
liabilities that are expected to arise, taking into account the development of the various litigation and arbitration
processes and any negotiations to resolve these cases. In 2008 income of 271 million Swiss francs was
recorded following the 24 April 2008 California Supreme Court decision in the City of Hope litigation (see
below). This consisted of the 310 million US dollars released to income as a favourable litigation settlement,
net of amounts recorded in respect of final settlement negotiations with the City of Hope National Medical
Center. Costs of other litigation matters that are less material are expensed in the current period and reported
within general and administration expenses. The total income tax recorded in respect of major legal cases
wasa benefit of 123 million Swiss francs (2008: expense of 105 million Swiss francs).
Legal provisions
Legal provisions consist of a number of separate legal matters, including claims arising from trade, in various
Group companies. The majority of any cash outflows for these other matters are expected to occur within
thenext one to three years, although these are dependent on the development of the various litigations.
Significant provisions are discounted by between 4% and 5% where the time value of money is material.
Environmental provisions
Provisions for environmental matters include various separate environmental issues in a number of countries.
By their nature the amounts and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict. The estimated timings of these
cash outflows are shown in the table above. Significant provisions are discounted by between 5% and 6%
where the time value of money is material.
Restructuring provisions
These arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of business undertaken by the
Groupor the manner in which business is conducted. Such provisions include only the costs necessarily
entailed by the restructuring which are not associated with the recurring activities of the Group. The timings
of these cash outflows are reasonably certain on a global basis and are shown in the table above.
Significantprovisions are discounted by between 3% and 4% where the time value of money is material.95
Employee provisions
These mostly relate to certain employee benefit obligations, such as sabbatical leave and long-service
benefits. The timings of these cash outflows can be reasonably estimated based on past performance and
areshown in the table above. Significant provisions are discounted by 6% where the time value of money
ismaterial.
Other provisions
Other provisions mostly relate to sales returns and various other provisions from Group companies that do not
fit into the above categories. The timings of cash outflows are by their nature uncertain and the best estimates
are shown in the table above. These provisions are not discounted as the time value of money is not material
in these matters.
Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees, to be affected
by political, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating to environmental
protection, in the countries in which it operates. The industries in which the Group operates are also subject
to other risks of various kinds. The nature and frequency of these developments and events, not all of which
are covered by insurance, as well as their effect on future operations and earnings, are not predictable.
The Group has entered into strategic alliances with various companies in order to gain access to potential
new products or to utilise other companies to help develop the Group’s own potential new products. Potential
future payments may become due to certain collaboration partners achieving certain milestones as defined in
the collaboration agreements. The Group’s best estimates of future commitments for such payments are given
in Note 14.
Pharmaceuticals legal cases
On 10 June 2002 Genentech announced that a Los Angeles County Superior Court jury voted to award the
City of Hope National Medical Center (‘City of Hope’) approximately 300 million US dollars in compensatory
damages based on a finding of a breach of a 1976 agreement between Genentech and the City of Hope.
On24 June 2002 the jury voted to award the City of Hope 200 million US dollars in punitive damages in the
same case. On 13 September 2002 Genentech filed a notice of appeal of the jury verdict and damages awards
with the California Court of Appeal. On 21 October 2004 the Court of Appeal affirmed the verdict and
damages awards in all respects. Also, on 21 October 2004 Genentech announced that it would seek review
by the California Supreme Court, which has discretion over which cases it will review. On 24 November 2004
Genentech filed its petition for review by the California Supreme Court and on 2 February 2005 the California
Supreme Court granted this petition. The appeal to the California Supreme Court was heard on 5 February
2008 and on 24 April 2008 overturned the award of 200 million US dollars in punitive damages to the City of
Hope, but upheld the award of 300 million US dollars in compensatory damages. On 9 May 2008 Genentech
paid 476 million US dollars to the City of Hope, reflecting the amount of compensatory damages awarded,
plus interest thereon from the date of the original decision on 10 June 2002. On 31 March 2009 Genentech
and the City of Hope National Medical Center resolved all remaining issues regarding additional royalties
andother amounts that Genentech owes to City of Hope under the 1976 agreement for third-party product
sales and settlement of a third-party patent litigation, including those that occurred afterthe 2002
judgementby a Los Angeles County Superior Court jury.
During the appeals process interest had accrued on the total amount of the damages at a simple annual
rateof 10%. During 2008 interest of 11 million Swiss francs was recorded as the time cost of provisions within
financing costs.
A full provision, totalling 776 million US dollars as at 31 December 2007, had been recorded for these awards.
As a result of the 24 April 2008 California Supreme Court decision, provisions totalling 310 million US dollars
were released to income in 2008 as a favourable litigation settlement, of which 200 million US dollars relates
tothe original award recorded in 2002 as an exceptional major legal case expense and 110 million US dollars
relates to interest accrued as a charge to financing costs in the intervening periods.96
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
On 3 October 2002 Genentech entered into an arrangement with third-party insurance companies to post a
surety bond in connection with this judgment. As part of this arrangement Genentech had pledged 788 million
US dollars in cash and investments to secure this bond. This amount, which was equivalent to 889 million
Swiss francs at 31 December 2007, was recorded as restricted cash within other current assets in the Annual
Financial Statements. During the third quarter of 2008 the court completed certain administrative procedures
to dismiss the case. As a result the restrictions were lifted from the restricted cash and investments and the
funds became available for use in Genentech’s operations.
On 4 October 2004 Genentech received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice, requesting
documents related to the promotion of Rituxan. Genentech co-operated with the government’s associated
investigation. Previously the investigation had been both civil and criminal in nature. Genentech was informed
in August 2008 by the criminal prosecutor who handled this matter that the government has declined to
prosecute Genentech criminally in connection with this investigation. The civil matter was still ongoing.
Through counsel Genentech continued to have discussions with government representatives about the status
of theirinvestigation and Genentech’s views on this matter, including potential resolution. On 20 October
2009 the government notified Genentech that it had decided not to make any civil claim against Genentech.
Thegovernment’s investigation was initiated by a complaint that was filed under seal in the US District Court
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in 2003 by an individual plaintiff. The complaint was unsealed on
31December 2009 and is currently the basis of civil litigation by the plaintiff against Roche Holdings, Inc.
andGenentech. The Group intends to vigorously defend itself. The outcome of this civil litigation cannot
bedetermined at this time.
On 13 May 2005 a request was filed by a third party for re-examination of US Patent No. 6,331,415
(‘theCabilly patent’) that is co-owned by Genentech and the City of Hope National Medical Center and
underwhich other companies have been licensed and are paying royalties. On 7 July 2005 the US Patent
andTrademark Office (‘the Patent Office’) ordered a re-examination of this patent. On 25 February 2008
thePatent Office mailed a final Patent Office action rejecting all the claims of the Cabilly patent. Genentech
filed a notice of appeal challenging the rejection on 22 August 2008. Genentech’s opening appeal brief
wasfiled on 9 December 2008. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal brief, the Patent Office continued with
the re-examination. On 12 and 13 February 2009 Genentech filed further responses with the Patent Office
thatincluded proposed amendments to three claims of the patent (claims 21, 27, and 32) and the claims
thatdepend on these three claims. On 23 February 2009 the Patent Office issued a Notice of Intent to Issue
a Re-examination Certificate (‘NIRC’), confirming the patentability of all claims of the Cabilly patent as
amended. None of the amendments have a commercial impact on the Cabilly patent. The NIRC is final and
non-appealable. A re-examination certificate was issued on 19 May 2009 reflecting the formal termination
ofthese proceedings in Genentech’s favour.
On 30 May 2008 Centocor, Inc. filed a patent lawsuit against Genentech and City of Hope in the US District
Court for the Central District of California. The lawsuit relates to the Cabilly patent and seeks a declaratory
judgment of patent invalidity and unenforceability with regard to the Cabilly patent and of patent non-infringe-
ment with regard to certain of Centocor’s products. Centocor filed an amended complaint on 3 September
2008. Genentech answered the complaint on 19 September 2008 and also filed counterclaims against Centocor
alleging that four Centocor products infringe certain Genentech patents. Genentech filed an amendment to
those counterclaims on 10 October 2008 and Centocor answered these counterclaims on 26 November 2008.
Discovery is ongoing in the lawsuit. The Cabilly patent, which expires in 2018, relates to methods used
byGenentech and others to make certain antibodies or antibody fragments, as well as cells and DNA used
inthese methods. Genentech has licensed the Cabilly patent to other companies and derives significant
royalties from these licences. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.97
On 8 October 2009, Glaxo Group Limited, SmithKline Beecham Corporation, and GlaxoSmithKline LLC
(collectively ‘GSK’) filed a patent lawsuit against Genentech and City of Hope in the US District Court for
the Southern District of Florida. The lawsuit relates to the Cabilly patent and seeks a declaratory judgment
ofpatent invalidity and unenforceability with regard to the Cabilly patent and of patent non-infringement
with regard to a certain GSK product. On 16 December 2009 Genentech filed a motion to dismiss, or in the
alternative to transfer to the Central District of California. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined
atthis time.
In 2006 Genentech made development decisions involving its humanised anti-CD20 programme, and its
collaborator, Biogen Idec Inc., disagreed with certain of Genentech’s development decisions related
to humanised anti-CD20 products. The disputed issues were submitted to arbitration. On 15 June 2009
Genentech received the decision from the arbitrators, which included certain favourable and certain adverse
rulings relating to some of Genentech’s development decisions and programmes. The decision denied
allmonetary damages sought by both parties and did not change the collaboration profit split arrangement.
Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (‘HLR’) and various other Roche affiliates have been named as defendants in
numerous legal actions in the United States and elsewhere relating to the acne medication Accutane.
The litigation alleges that Accutane caused certain serious conditions, including, but not limited to, inflam-
matory bowel disease (‘IBD’), birth defects and psychiatric disorders. As of 31 December 2009 HLR is
defending approximately 714 actions brought in various federal and state courts throughout the United States
for personal injuries allegedly resulting from their use of Accutane. Most of the actions allege IBD as a result
of Accutane use. On 26 June 2009 HLR announced that, following a re-evaluation of its portfolio of medicines
that are now available from generic manufacturers, rapidly declining brand sales in the US and high costs
from personal-injury lawsuits that it continues to defend vigorously, it had decided to immediately discontinue
the manufacture and distribution of the product in the United States.
All of the actions pending in federal court alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in
a Multi-District Litigation in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division.
In July 2007 the District Court granted summary judgment in favour of HLR in the lead federal IBD cases.
Theplaintiffs appealed and in August 2008 these rulings were affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals
for the Eleventh Circuit. In October 2009 the District Court granted summary judgment in favour of HLR in
thenext five federal IBD cases. The plaintiffs appealed in November 2009. One recently filed matter remains.
All of the actions pending in state court in New Jersey alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings
in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County. As of 31 December 2009 juries in the
Superior Court have ruled in favour of the plaintiff in five cases, assessing total compensatory damages
totalling 26 million US dollars. The first verdict was reversed on appeal; the re-trial is scheduled for January
2010. HLR has appealed the second verdict to the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division and is
currently in the process of post-trial briefing for the remaining trial, which involved three plaintiffs.
In October 2007 a jury in the Circuit Court of Escambia County, Florida, returned a verdict in favour of the
plaintiff, assessing total compensatory damages of 7 million US dollars, subsequently reduced to 6.8 million
US dollars by the court, against the Company. In October 2009, the District Court of Appeal, State of Florida
reversed and entered judgment as to HLR. The plaintiff has sought review in the Supreme Court of Florida.
Additional trials are scheduled for 2010. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including
many that are unique to the particular case and therefore the trial results to date may not be predictive
offuture trial results. The Group continues to defend vigorously the remaining personal injury cases
andclaims.98
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
HLR and Roche Laboratories Inc. (‘RLI’), along with approximately 50 other brand and generic pharma-
ceutical companies, have been named as defendants in several legal actions in the United States relating to
the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs and State Medicaid reimbursement. The primary allegation in these
litigations is that the pharmaceutical companies misrepresented or otherwise reported inaccurate Average
Wholesale Prices (‘AWP’) and/or Wholesale Acquisition Costs (‘WAC’) for their drugs, which prices were
allegedly relied upon by the States in calculating Medicaid reimbursements to entities such as retail pharma-
cies. The States, through their respective Attorney General, are seeking repayment of the amounts they
claimwere over-reimbursed. The time period associated with these cases is 1991—2005. As of 31 December
2009, HLR and RLI are defending 10 actions brought in seven States, including four matters in New York,
andone in each of the following states: Alabama, Mississippi, New Jersey, Kansas, Hawaii, and Iowa.
Discovery is currently pending in each of these cases. HLR and RLI intend to vigorously defend themselves
inthese matters. The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
HLR, along with various other branded pharmaceutical companies, has been named as a defendant in
several legal actions in the United States brought by retail pharmacies relating to the discounting practices
forBrandName Prescription Drugs (‘BNPD’). In these BNPD litigations, the plaintiffs allege that they were
denied discounts for certain prescription drugs that were offered to other mail order and managed care
entities, which denial is claimed to be a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act (‘RPA’). The RPA is a Federal
law that prohibits unlawful price discrimination. In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants
conspired in their refusal to offer them certain discounts. The conspiracy claims against all defendants were
previously settled, with only the RPA claims remaining to be litigated. As of 31 December 2009 HLR is
defending approximately 120 BNPD actions brought by approximately 3,000 retail pharmacies in various
federal and state courts throughout the United States. Discovery is currently pending in each of these cases.
HLR is not currently scheduled for a trial in any of these BNPD matters in 2010. HLR intends to vigorously
defend itself. The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
On 19 November 2007 Novartis Vaccines & Diagnostics, Inc. (the former Chiron affiliate of Novartis) filed
alawsuit against Trimeris, Inc. and four Roche Group companies: Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., F. Hoffmann-
La Roche Ltd, Roche Laboratories Inc. and Roche Colorado Corp., in the US District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas. The complaint seeks an injunction and damages for the manufacture and sale of Roche’s
anti-AIDS drug Fuzeon in the United States. Novartis alleges these activities infringe the claims of US Patent
No. 7,285,271. At Roche and Trimeris’s request the case has been transferred to the US District Court for
North Carolina. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
On 28 June 2003 Mr Ubaldo Bao Martinez filed a lawsuit against the Porriño Town Council and Genentech
España S.L. in the Contentious Administrative Court Number One of Pontevedra, Spain. The lawsuit
challenges the Town Council’s decision to grant licenses to Genentech España S.L. for the construction
andoperation of a warehouse and biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Porriño, Spain. On 16 January
2008 the Administrative Court ruled in favour of Mr Bao on one of the claims in the lawsuit and ordered
theclosing and demolition of the facility, subject to certain further legal proceedings. On 12 February 2008,
Genentech España S.L. and the Town Council filed appeals of the Administrative Court decision at the High
Court in Galicia, Spain. In addition, through legal counsel in Spain, Genentech is co-operating with the Lonza
Group Ltd (‘Lonza’) to pursue administrative remedies, including seeking additional permits for the facility.
Genentech sold the assets of Genentech España S.L., including the Porriño facility, to Lonza in December
2006, and Lonza has operated the facility since that time. Under the terms of that sale, Genentech retained
control of the defence of this lawsuit and agreed to indemnify Lonza against certain contractually defined
liabilities up to a specified limit, which is currently estimated to be approximately 100 million US dollars.
Genentech’s indemnification obligation to Lonza, if any, cannot be determined at this time.99
On 8 May,11 June, 8 August, and 29 September 2008, Genentech was named as a defendant, along with
InterMune, Inc. and its former chief executive officer, W. Scott Harkonen, in four separate class-action com-
plaints filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of plaintiffs who allegedly
paid part or all of the purchase price for a product that was licensed by Genentech to Connectics Corporation
and was subsequently assigned to InterMune. Genentech responded to these complaints with a motion to
dismiss these matters, which was granted on 28 April 2009. Plaintiffs filed amended complaints including only
state law claims on 28 May 2009. Genentech responded to these complaints with another motion to dismiss,
which was held on 11 September 2009. The Court again granted Genentech’s motion to dismiss with respect
to all claims, but with leave for plaintiffs to replead specific claims under California unfair competition law.
Plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint on 23 December 2009 naming Genentech as a defendant
inclaims for unfair competition law, false advertising law, consumer remedies law, consumer protection
law,and unjust enrichment. Genentech intends to seek dismissal of this amended complaint. The outcome
ofthis matter cannot be determined at this time.
Subsequent to the announcement of the Roche Proposal to purchase all of the outstanding shares of
Genentech common stock not owned by Roche (see Note 3), more than thirty shareholder lawsuits have been
filed against Genentech and/or the members of its Board of Directors, and various Roche entities including
Roche Holdings, Inc. (RHI) and Roche Holding Ltd (Roche Holding AG). The cases have been settled and on
9 July 2009 the settlement was approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery.
On 27 October 2008 Genentech and Biogen Idec Inc. filed a complaint against Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland
GmbH (‘Sanofi’), Sanofi-Aventis US LLC and Sanofi-Aventis US Inc. in the Northern District of California
seeking a declaratory judgement that certain Genentech products, including Rituxan, do not infringe Sanofi’s
US Patents 5,849,522 (‘the ‘522 patent’) and 6,218,140 (‘the ‘140 patent’) and a declaratory judgement
thatthe ‘522 and ‘140 patents are invalid. Also on 27 October 2008 Sanofi filed suit against Genentech and
Biogen Idec in the Eastern District of Texas, Lufkin Division, claiming that Rituxan and at least eight other
Genentech products infringe the ‘522 and ‘140 patents. Sanofi brought claims for preliminary and permanent
injunctions, compensatory and exemplary damages, and other relief. Genentech challenged the venue of
theTexas case and, after an opinion by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, the Texas and California cases
have been consolidated in the Northern District of California. Discovery in these consolidated matters is
ongoing. In addition on 24 October 2008 Hoechst GmbH filed with the ICC International Court of Arbitration
(Paris) a request for arbitration with Genentech, relating to a terminated agreement between Hoechst’s
predecessors and Genentech that pertained to the above patents and related patents outside the United
States. Hoechst is seeking payments on royalties on sales of Genentech products, damages for breach
ofcontract, and other relief. The hearing for the arbitration has been set for August 2010. Genentech intends
to vigorously defend itself. The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Fair Value Option
In 2005 the Group applied the Fair Value Option on three of its outstanding debt instruments on which the
Group had been applying fair value hedge accounting in the past. These debt instruments are the ‘European
Medium Term Note programme’ Euro bonds, the ‘Chameleon’ US dollar bonds and the ‘Rodeo’ Swiss
francbonds. These instruments were fully redeemed at their due dates in 2008 and 2009. The Fair Value
Option treatment is based on the elimination of an accounting mismatch which had been recognised
betweenthehedging swaps (reported at fair value) and the hedged bonds (reported at amortised cost).
Issuance of new bonds and notes — 2009
The Group financed the Genentech transaction (see Note 3) by a combination of the Group’s own funds,
debtsecurities, and commercial paper. The Group raised net proceeds of approximately 48.2 billion Swiss
francs through a series of debt offerings, as described below. All newly issued debt is senior, unsecured
andhas been guaranteed by Roche Holding Ltd.
US dollar-denominated notes | On 25 February 2009 the Group completed an offering of US dollar-
denominated notes to qualified institutional buyers in the United States under Rule 144A and to persons
otherthan US persons outside the United States under Regulation S of the US Securities Act of 1933.
TheGroup received approximately 16.3 billion US dollars aggregate net proceeds from the issuance
and sale of these fixed and floating rate notes. On 20 March 2009 the Group completed a further offering
ofUS dollar-denominated notes under Rule 144A of the US Securities Act of 1933. Roche received
approximately 2.5 billion US dollars in aggregate net proceeds from the issuance and sale of these fixed
ratenotes. Theterms and proceeds of the notes were as follows:

Collateral agreements | Collateral agreements were entered with the derivative counterparties to the
abovecurrency swaps to mitigate counterparty risk. As the fair value of the derivative instruments moved up
during 2009 due to a weaker US dollar, cash collateral of 1.5 billion Swiss francs had been delivered to
Rocheas at 31 December 2009. This collateral is recorded as an increase in cash and a corresponding
increase in accrued liabilities. At the same time the Group delivered cash collateral of 62 million Swiss francs
for those derivatives which had a negative fair value. This collateral paid is recorded as an increase in other
current assets and a corresponding decrease in cash. In addition the Group generated cash flows of 1.8 billion
Swiss francs from realised gains on hedging derivatives with shorter maturities that were settled during 2009.
Redemption and repurchase of bonds and notes — 2009
Redemption of ‘Chameleon’ US dollar bonds | The Group redeemed these bonds with a remaining
outstanding principal value of 487 million US dollars, which had a due date of 6 July 2009, at the original
issue amount plus accrued original issue discount (‘OID'). The effective interest rate of these bonds
was6.77%. The cash outflow was 530 million Swiss francs. There was no gain or loss recorded in the income
statement upon the redemption.104
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Redemption and repurchase of US dollar-denominated notes | The Group redeemed notes with
a principal value of 2,500 million US dollars, which had a due date of 23 September 2009, at the original
issue amount plus accrued original issue discount (‘OID’). The effective interest rate of these bonds was
1.98%. The cash outflow was 2,560 million Swiss francs. There was no gain or loss recorded in the income
statement upon the redemption.

Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The Group completed the purchase of the non-controlling interests in Genentech effective 26 March 2009,
asdescribed in Note 3. Based on the revised International Accounting Standard 27 ‘Consolidated and
Separate Financial Statements’ (IAS 27), which was adopted by the Group in 2008, this transaction was
accounted for in full as an equity transaction. As a consequence, the carrying amount of the consolidated
equity of the Group was reduced by 52.2 billion Swiss francs, of which 8.5 billion Swiss francs was
allocatedto eliminate the book value of Genentech non-controlling interests. This accounting effect significantly
impacts the Group’s net equity, but has no effect on the Group’s business or its dividend policy.
Share capital
As of 31 December 2009, the authorised and issued share capital of Roche Holding Ltd, which is the Group’s
parent company, consisted of 160,000,000 shares with a nominal value of 1.00 Swiss franc each, as in the
preceding year. The shares are bearer shares and the Group does not maintain a register of shareholders.
Based on information supplied to the Group, a shareholder group with pooled voting rights owns 50.0125%
(2008: 50.0125%) of the issued shares. This is further described in Note 33. Based on information supplied
tothe Group, Novartis Ltd, Basel, and its affiliates own 33.3330% (participation below 331⁄ %) of the issued
3
shares (2008: 33.3330%).
Non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
As of 31 December 2009, 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities have been authorised and were in issue
as in the preceding year. Under Swiss company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value,
are not part of the share capital and cannot be issued against a contribution which would be shown as an
asset in the balance sheet of Roche Holding Ltd. Each non-voting equity security confers the same rights
asany of the shares to participate in the net profit and any remaining proceeds from liquidation following
repayment of the nominal value of the shares and, if any, participation certificates. In accordance with the law
and the Articles of Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd, the Company is entitled at all times to exchange all
orsome of the non-voting equity securities into shares or participation certificates.
Dividends
On 10 March 2009 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of 5.00 Swiss francs per share
and non-voting equity securities (2008: 4.60 Swiss francs) in respect of the 2008 business year. The distribu-
tion to holders of outstanding shares and non-voting equity securities totalled 4,300 million Swiss francs
(2008:3,969 million Swiss francs) and has been recorded against retained earnings in 2009. The Board of
Directors has proposed dividends for the 2009 business year of 6.00 Swiss francs per share and non-voting
equity security which, if approved, would result in a total distribution to shareholders of 5,175 million Swiss
francs. This is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 2 March 2010.

29. Earnings per share and non-voting equity security
Basic earnings per share and non-voting equity security
For the calculation of basic earnings per share and non-voting equity security, the number of shares and non-
voting equity securities is reduced by the weighted average number of its own non-voting equity securities
held by the Group during the period.

Diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security, the net income and
weightedaverage number of shares and non-voting equity securities outstanding are adjusted for the effects
of all dilutive potential shares and non-voting equity securities.
Potential dilutive effects arise from the employee stock option plans. The exercise of outstanding vested
employee stock options would have a dilutive effect. The exercise of the outstanding vested Chugai and,
priorto the Genentech transaction, Genentech employee stock options would have a dilutive effect if the net
income of Chugai or Genentech is positive. The diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security
reflects the potential impacts of these dilutive effects on the earnings per share figures.

31. Statement of cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities arise from the Group’s primary activities in the Pharmaceuticals and
Diagnostics businesses. These are calculated by the indirect method by adjusting the Group’s operating profit
for any operating income and expenses that are not cash flows (for example depreciation, amortisation and
impairment) in order to derive the cash generated from operations. This and other operating cash flows are
shown in the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flows also include income taxes paid on all activities.112

Cash flows from investing activities
Cash flows from investing activities are principally those arising from the Group’s investments in property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets, and from the acquisition and divestment of subsidiaries,
associates and businesses. Cash flows connected with the Group’s portfolio of marketable securities and
other investments are also included, as are any interest and dividend payments received in respect of these
securities and investments. These cash flows indicate the Group’s net reinvestment in its operating assets
andthe cash flow effects of business combinations and divestments, as well as the cash generated by
theGroup’s other investments.
Interest and dividends received | in millions of CHF
2009 2008
Interest received 305 606

Total 306 611
Cash flows from financing activities
Cash flows from financing activities are primarily the proceeds from the issue and repayment of the Group’s
equity and debt instruments. They also include interest payments and dividend payments on these
instruments. Cash flows from short-term financing, including finance leases, are also included. These cash
flows indicate the Group’s transactions with the providers of its equity and debt financing. Cash flows
fromshort-term borrowings are shown as a net movement, as these consist of a large number of transactions
with short maturity.
Significant non-cash transactions
Of the total purchase consideration of 376 million US dollars for Lonza Singapore, 225 million US dollars
(238million Swiss francs) was a non-cash settlement of loans previously made by Genentech to Lonza.
SeeNote 7 for further information.113
32. Risk management
Group risk management
Risk management is a fundamental element of the Group’s business practice on all levels and encompasses
different types of risks. At a group level risk management is an integral part of the business planning and
controlling processes. Material risks are monitored and regularly discussed with the Corporate Executive
Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Financial risk management specifically is
described in further detail below.
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising from its underlying operations and corporate finance
activities. The Group’s financial risk exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange
rates, interest rates and equity prices as well as the creditworthiness and the solvency of the Group’s
counterparties.
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies reviewed by the boards of directors
ofRoche or Chugai as appropriate to their areas of statutory responsibility. These policies cover credit risk,
liquidity risk and market risk. The policies provide guidance on risk limits, type of authorised financial
instruments and monitoring procedures. As a general principle, the policies prohibit the use of derivative
financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Policy implementation and day-to-day risk management
are carried out by the relevant treasury functions and regular reporting on these risks is performed by the
relevant accounting and controlling functions within Roche and Chugai.

Following the implementation of amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ that were
published in March 2009 the Group has established a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of
inputs used in making the fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy includes the following three
levels:
• Level 1 — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
• Level 2 — observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
• Level 3 — unobservable inputs

At 31 December 2009 level 1 financial assets consist of treasury bills, bonds and quoted shares. Level 2
financial assets consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, derivative financial instruments
and unquoted shares. Level 3 financial assets consist of auction-rate student loan securities. These securities
were valued based on broker-provided valuation models, which approximate fair value. During 2009, there
were no significant transfers between level 1 and level 2 and vice versa.

Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations,
causing financial losses for the Group. The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses
of liquid funds deposited with or invested in such counterparties.
The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering netting
agreements and without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements, is equal to
thecarrying value of the Group’s financial assets.
Trade receivables | These are subject to a policy of active credit risk management which focuses on the
assessment of country risk, credit availability, ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures.
The objective of the management of trade receivables is to sustain the growth and profitability of the Group
byoptimising asset utilisation whilst maintaining risks at an acceptable level. Except as noted below, there is
no significant concentration of counterparty credit risk due to the Group’s large number of customers and
their wide geographical spread. Risk limits and exposures are continuously monitored by country and by the
nature of counterparties. Additionally, the Group obtains credit insurance and similar enhancements when
appropriate to protect the collection of trade receivables. As at 31 December 2009 no collateral was held for
loans and receivables (2008: none).
At 31 December 2009 the Group’s combined trade accounts receivable balance with three US national
wholesale distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corp., Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corp., was equivalent
to 1.3 billion Swiss francs representing 13% of the Group’s consolidated trade accounts receivable
(2008:1.4billion Swiss francs representing 15%).

Cash and marketable securities | These are subject to a policy of restricting exposures to high-quality
counterparties and setting defined limits for individual counterparties. These limits and counterparty
creditratings are reviewed regularly. Investments in marketable securities are entered into on the basis
ofguidelines with regard to liquidity, quality and maximum amount. As a general rule, the Group invests
only in high quality securities with adequate liquidity. Cash and short-term time deposits are subject

Derivatives | The Group signs netting and collateral agreements under an ISDA (International Swaps
andDerivatives Association) master agreement with the respective counterparties in order to mitigate
counterparty risk on derivative positions. During 2009 the Group entered into derivative contracts with third
parties to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from bonds and notes issued by the Group’s US affiliate,
Roche Holdings, Inc. in currencies other than US dollar. The total exposure hedged at issuance of these
bonds and notes was approximately 25 billion Swiss francs (see Note 27). As the fair value of the derivative
instruments moved up due to a weaker US dollar, net cash collateral of 1.5 billion Swiss francs was
deliveredto the Group.

As at 31 December 2009 there are no financial assets whose terms have been renegotiated (2008: none).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point
intime. The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order
tomeet its liquidity requirements at any point in time. Group liquidity is reported to senior management on
amonthly basis.
Roche and Chugai enjoy strong credit quality and are rated by at least one major credit rating agency.
The ratings will permit efficient access to the international capital markets in the event of major financing
requirements. In addition, the Group has unused committed credit lines with various financial institutions
totalling 5.1 billion Swiss francs (2008: 5.2 billion Swiss francs).117

Market risk
Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities. Market
risk may affect the Group financial result and the value of Group equity.
The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to measure the impact of market risk on its financial instruments.
Rochehas defined VaR limits to manage market risk. VaR data are reported on a monthly basis and indicate
the value range within which a given financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result
ofmovements in market prices. VaR is a statistical measure which implicitly assumes that value changes of
therecent past are indicative of value changes in the future. VaR figures do not represent actual or expected
losses, or possible worst-case losses over the stated period.
VaR figures are calculated using a historical simulation approach. For each scenario, all financial instruments
are fully valued and the total change in value and earnings is determined. All VaR calculations are based
ona95% confidence level and a holding period of 20 trading days over the past ten years. This holding period
reflects the time required to change the corresponding risk exposure, should this be deemed appropriate.
Longer holding periods increase the probability of higher value changes and lead to increased VaR figures.
Actual future gains and losses associated with our treasury activities may differ materially from the VaR
analyses performed due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount
of changes to interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and equity investment prices, particularly
in periods of high market volatilities. Furthermore, the VaR numbers below do not include the effect
ofchanges in credit spreads.118

VaR — Interest rate component 717 27
VaR — Other price component 57 62
Diversification (98) (52)
VaR — Total market risk 719 133
At 31 December 2009 the total VaR of the financial assets and liabilities was 719 million Swiss francs
(31December 2008: 133 million Swiss francs). The interest rate VaR increased substantially to 717 million
Swiss francs driven by the 48.2 billion Swiss francs of bonds and notes issued in the first quarter of 2009.
Asall newly issued debt is held at amortised cost, the interest rate VaR is a sole metric for economic fair
valuechanges, but there is no impact on the carrying value or profit and loss of the Group. The foreign
exchange VaR decreased as hedges of non-US dollar cash flows from future royalty income at Genentech
were unwound. Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities and
remainedrelatively stable. At 31 December 2009, the Group held equity securities with a market value of
0.6billion Swiss francs (31 December 2008: 0.6 billion Swiss francs). This includes holdings in biotechnology
companies, which were acquired in the context of licensing transactions or scientific collaborations.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates across the world and is exposed to movements in foreign currencies affecting the
Groupfinancial result and the value of Group’s equity. Foreign exchange risk arises because the amount of
local currency paid or received for transactions denominated in foreign currencies may vary due to changes
inexchange rates (‘transaction exposures’) and because the foreign currency denominated financial
statements of the Group’s foreign subsidiaries may vary upon consolidation into the Swiss franc denominated
Group Financial Statements (‘translation exposures’).
The objective of the Group’s foreign exchange risk management activities is to preserve the economic value
ofits current and future assets and to minimise the volatility of the Group’s financial result. The primary focus
of the Group’s foreign exchange risk management activities is on hedging transaction exposures arising
through foreign currency flows or monetary positions held in foreign currencies. The Group does not currently
hedge translation exposures using financial instruments.
The Group monitors transaction exposures on a daily basis. The net foreign exchange result and the
corresponding VaR parameters are reported on a monthly basis. The Group uses forward contracts, foreign
exchange options and cross-currency swaps to hedge transaction exposures. Application of these
instruments intends to continuously lock in favourable developments of foreign exchange rates, thereby
reducing the exposure to potential future movements in such rates.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could affect the Group financial result
orthevalue of Group equity. Changes in interest rates may cause variations in interest income and expense.
Inaddition, they may affect the market value of certain financial assets, liabilities and hedging instruments.
The primary objective of the Group’s interest rate management is to protect the net interest result.
Interest rate exposures and the corresponding VaR parameters are reported on a monthly basis. The Group
uses forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge its interest rate exposures. Depending on the interest
rateenvironment of major currencies, the Group will use these instruments to generate the appropriate mix
offixed and floating rate exposures.119
Other price risk
Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities. At 31 December 2009,
theGroup held equity securities with a market value of 0.6 billion Swiss francs (2008: 0.6 billion Swiss
francs). This amount includes holdings in biotechnology companies, which were acquired in the context
oflicensing transactions or scientific collaborations. Due to the nature of their business, biotechnology
companies are exposed to greater equity volatilities than general stock market fluctuations.
The Group manages the price risk through placing limits on individual and total equity investments.
These limits are defined both as a percentage of total liquid funds and as an absolute number for individual
equity investments. Equity price risk is reported as a VaR figure on a monthly basis to senior management.
Impairment of financial assets
During 2008 impairments of shares were triggered by a significant or prolonged price decline below
costvalue. In 2009 impairments of loans and receivables were mainly due to an increase in the expected
non-recoverability of trade receivables (see also Note 18).

Capital
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total capitalisation, being the sum of debt plus
equity, including non-controlling interests. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide benefits
for patients and returns to investors.
• To provide an adequate return to investors based on the level of risk undertaken.
• To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver
future benefits for patients and returns to investors.
• To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The Group completed the purchase of the non-controlling interests in Genentech effective 26 March 2009,
asdescribed in Note 3. Based on the revised International Accounting Standard 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate
Financial Statements’ (IAS 27), which was adopted by the Group in 2008, this transaction was accounted for
infull as an equity transaction. As a consequence, the carrying amount of the consolidated equity of the Group
was reduced by 52.2 billion Swiss francs, of which 8.5 billion Swiss francs was allocated to eliminate the book
value of Genentech non-controlling interests. This accounting effect significantly impacts the Group’s net
equity, but has no effect on the Group’s business or its dividend policy.
Capital is monitored on the basis of the capitalisation, which is calculated as being debt plus equity
(includingnon-controlling interests). This is reported to senior management as part of the Group’s regular
internal management reporting. The Group’s capitalisation is shown in the table below.120

Roche Group — Report of Roche Management on Internal Control overFinancial Reporting Roche Finance Report 2009
Report of Roche Management on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate control over financial reporting. The internal control system was designed to provide
reasonable assurance over the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation
ofconsolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reason-
ableassurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections ofany
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting as of
31December 2009 based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described
inInternal Control — Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the system
ofinternal control over financial reporting was effective as of 31 December 2009.
The Statutory Auditor KPMG AG, have audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd
forthe year ended 31 December 2009, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and with the
International Standards on Auditing (ISA). They have also issued a report on the effectiveness of the Group’s
system of internal control over financial reporting. This report is set out on pages 128—129.

Report of the Statutory Auditor on the
Consolidated Financial Statements
Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Consolidated Financial Statements
to the Annual General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
As statutory auditor, we have audited the consolidated financial statements (income statement, statement
ofcomprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, statement of changes in equity and notes
on pages 30 to 124) of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Board of Directors’ Responsibility | The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair
presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and the requirements of Swiss law. This responsibility includes designing, implementing
andmaintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board
ofDirectors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making
accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s Responsibility | Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, Swiss Auditing
Standards and International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material
misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
theconsolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
tofraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant
to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appro-
priateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well
as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion | In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 give
atrue and fair view of the financial position, the results of operations and the cash flows in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law.127
Report on Other Legal Requirements
We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA)
and independence (article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with
our independence.
In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm
thataninternal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial
statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.
We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Group — Report of the Independent Auditor on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of the Independent Auditor on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of the Independent Auditor on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
to the Annual General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
We have examined the Roche Group’s system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December
2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee
ofSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting as included in the accompanying Report of Roche Management on Internal Control
overFinancial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our examination. An entity’s internal control over financial reporting is a
processeffected by the entity’s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial statements prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial
reporting framework; and(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection
ofthe unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity's assets that could have a material effect on
the entity’s financial statements.
We conducted our examination in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements
3000 (ISAE 3000). This standard requires that we plan and perform our examination to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our examination included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
otherprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of
management override of controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also,
projections of any evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject tothe
riskthat internal control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because thedegree
ofcompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.129
In our opinion, the Roche Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control, over financial
reporting as of 31 December 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and International Standards on Auditing,
the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended 31 December 2009 and our
report dated 28 January 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

ofDirectors received 34,084 awards and members of the CEC received a total of 62,666 awards, of which
20,450 awards were granted to Dr Schwan. The fair value of these awards for the employee is calculated

orCHF169.40) discounted to take into account the period in which they are blocked (3 years: 83.962%,

Employer contribution to social security schemes and pension plans | The Group pays social insurance
contributions in respect of the above remuneration and pays contributions to pension and other post-
employment benefit plans for the Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate Executive
Committee.
Equity Compensation Plans | The Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate
Executive Committee also participate in certain equity compensation plans as described below. The terms
andvesting conditions of these awards are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The fair values used in the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the cost to the company at
grant date and reflect amongst other matters the observed exercise behaviour and exit rate for the whole
population that receive the awards and initial simulations of any performance conditions. For the purposes
ofthese remuneration disclosures the values are calculated based on the fair value that the employee
receivestaking into account the preliminary assessment of any completed performance conditions.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate Executive Committee are eligible to
participate in Roche Connect, a programme that enables employees to make regular deductions from their
salaries to purchase non-voting equity securities. The Group contributes to the programme, which allows the
employees to purchase non-voting equity securities at a discount (usually 20%).
During 2009 members of the Corporate Executive Committee were granted 669,675 Stock-settled Stock
Appreciation Rights (S-SARs). The individual awards relating to 2009 are shown in the table below. The fair
value of these awards for the employee is 20.30 Swiss francs, which is calculated using the Black-Scholes
formula, assuming holding until maturity, and deducting 11% for the average two-year vesting period.
TheChairman of the Board of Directors was not granted S-SARs in 2009 and 2008.144
Roche Finance Report 2009 Roche Holding Ltd, Basel — Notes to the Financial Statements
Members of the Corporate Executive Committee and other members of senior management participate in
theRoche Performance Share Plan (PSP). The Group has three overlapping three-year PSPs. The target
awards for the three-year cycle are defined at the beginning of the cycle and the awards are considered to
form part of the employee’s remuneration in three equal annual amounts over the three-year cycle. Each
award will result in between zero and two non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine), depending upon the
achievement of the performance targets, and the discretion of the Board of Directors. The individual awards
relating to 2009 are shown in the table below. The number of the awards is calculated as follows:
• PSP 2007—2009: At the end of the cycle the performance targets were not achieved and accordingly the
participants received none of the originally targeted non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine).
• PSP 2008—2010: One non-voting equity security (Genussschein)per award.
• PSP 2009—2011: One non-voting equity security (Genussschein)per award.
• The resulting allocations are multiplied by the non-voting equity security (Genussschein)price
at 31 December 2009 of 175.80 Swiss francs to give the fair value for the remuneration received by the
employee.

Webelieve that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.

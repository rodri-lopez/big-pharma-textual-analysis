1) Proposed by the Board of Directors.
CER (Constant Exchange Rates): The percentage changes at Constant Exchange Rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the 2011 and 2010
results at constant currencies (the average rates for the year ended 31 December 2010). This is the same concept that was previously labelled as ‘Local currencies’
by the Group.
Core results and Core EPS (Earnings Per Share): These exclude non-core items such as global restructuring charges and amortisation and impairment of intangible
assets. This allows a transparent assessment of both the actual results and the underlying performance of the business. A full income statement for the Group and
the operating results of the divisions are shown on both an IFRS and core basis. The core concept is fully described on pages 146–149 and reconciliations between
the IFRS and core results are given there.Finance – 2011 in brief
Roche in 2011 The Roche Group posted solid overall results in a challenging market in 2011. Core operating
profit grew faster than sales, and Core Earnings per Share increased by 11% at constant exchange
rates (CER). The appreciation of the Swiss franc against all major currencies had a significant
impact on the results expressed in Swiss francs. However, the underlying currency exposure is
mitigated by the large majority of the cost base located outside of Switzerland.
Sales Group sales increased slightly by 1% (CER) to 42.5 billion Swiss francs (–10% at reported
exchange rates). Excluding Tamiflu, Group sales grew by 2% (CER).
Pharmaceutical sales growth, excluding Tamiflu, was 1% (CER). The strong growth in key
oncology products, Lucentis in ophthalmology and Actemra/RoActemra in rheumatoid arthritis
was largely offset by the impacts of the US healthcare reforms, European austerity measures,
price cuts in Japan during 2010 and lower Avastin sales in the US and in Western Europe.
Diagnostics sales grew by 6% (CER), significantly ahead of market with Professional
Diagnostics and Tissue Diagnostics being the major contributors.
Operating results Core operating profit increased by 6% (CER) to 15.1 billion Swiss francs (–9% at reported
exchange rates). The cost savings from the Operational Excellence programme initiated in 2010
offset the substantially lower profit contribution from Avastin and Tamiflu as well as the impacts
from healthcare reforms, price pressure and patent expiry.
Research and development expenditure declined by 1% (CER) to 8.1 billion Swiss francs on
a core basis, primarily driven by project prioritisation and savings from Operational Excellence.
R&D costs are 19% of Group sales.
IFRS operating results include restructuring charges from the Operational Excellence
programme of 0.9 billion Swiss francs.
Non-operating results Core net financial expenses decreased by 0.7 million Swiss francs primarily due to lower
interest expenses resulting from the continued repayment of the debt taken out in 2009 to finance
the Genentech transaction.
Net income IFRS net income increased by 26% (CER) to 9.5 billion Swiss francs (+7% at reported exchange
rates), primarily driven by the strong operating result, lower restructuring charges, lower interest
expenses and a lower tax rate.
Core Earnings per Share increased by 11% in constant currencies (–4% at reported exchange
rates).
Cash flows Operating free cash flow of 13.7 billion Swiss francs, up 14% CER.
Free cash flow of 3.9 billion Swiss francs, up 21% CER.
Repayment of debt is ahead of schedule with 42% of the notes and bonds issued in 2009 to
finance the Genentech transaction being repaid by the end of 2011.
Financial position Net working capital increased by 5%, reflecting higher levels of trade receivables within
the public sector customers of certain Southern European countries.
Net debt position improved by 3.6 billion Swiss francs to 15.6 billion Swiss francs.
Credit ratings position strong: Moody’s at A1, upgraded from A2 during the second half of 2011,
and Standard & Poor’s at AA–.
Shareholder return Dividends are proposed to increase by 3%. This will represent the 25th consecutive year of
dividend growth and will result in an increased pay-out ratio of 55.3%, subject to AGM approval.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) increased by 22% representing a combined performance of
share and non-voting equity security.ROCHE GROUP

In 2011 the Roche Group’s net income increased by 26% at constant exchange rates. This was driven by a solid operating
performance in both the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics businesses. Costs for restructuring were less than in 2010,
and financing costs and the tax rate were also lower. The cost savings from the Operational Excellence programme initiated
in 2010 offset the substantially lower profit contribution from reduced sales of Tamiflu and Avastin, as well as the impacts
from healthcare reforms, price pressure and patent expiry.
The strengthening of the Swiss franc against all major currencies on average year-to-date basis had a significant negative
impact on the results expressed in Swiss francs. However the underlying currency translation exposure arising from non-Swiss
franc revenues is mitigated by the majority of the Group’s cost base being located outside Switzerland. In 2011 the Group’s
net income increased by 26% at constant exchange rates, but increased by only 7% when translated on consolidation into
Swiss francs.
Core EPS, which excludes non-core items such as global restructuring charges and amortisation and impairment
of intangible assets, increased by 11% at constant exchange rates (decrease of 4% when translated into Swiss francs).

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewSales
Sales increased slightly by 1% in constant currencies (–10% in Swiss francs; +5% in US dollars) to 42.5 billion Swiss francs.
Excluding Tamiflu, sales increased by 2% in constant currencies. The Pharmaceuticals Division represented 77% of Group
sales and the Diagnostics Division contributed 23%.
Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division were stable in constant currencies at 32.8 billion Swiss francs. Excluding Tamiflu,
the increase was 1%. Demand for the oncology drugs Herceptin, MabThera/Rituxan, Xeloda and Tarceva continued to grow
strongly. Additional major growth drivers were Lucentis in ophthalmology, Actemra/RoActemra in rheumatoid arthritis and
Mircera in renal anemia. These positive factors mostly offset the expected declines in sales of Tamiflu and Avastin, and patent
expiry effects for NeoRecormon/Epogin, Bonviva/Boniva and CellCept. There were continuing negative impacts from the
US healthcare reforms, European austerity measures and price cuts in Japan. The Diagnostics Division sales were 9.7 billion
Swiss francs, growing 6% in constant currencies (–7% in Swiss francs; +10% in US dollars), thereby strengthening its leading
market position. Major growth areas were Professional Diagnostics (up 9%) and Tissue Diagnostics (up 15%).

Core operating results
On a core basis, the Group’s operating profit increased by 6% at constant exchange rates (decreased 9% in Swiss francs),
while sales increased by 1% at CER. The core operating profit margin of both divisions increased, with the increase in
profitability being driven by the Operational Excellence programme and resource prioritisation, particularly in marketing
and distribution and research and development. The Operational Excellence programme led to a decline in marketing and
distribution expenses and in research and development costs in constant currencies. The strong Swiss franc had a negative
effect on the margin developments of 1.1 percentage points on Group level, a 1.1 percentage point on Pharmaceutical
Division and 0.3 of a percentage point for the Diagnostics Division.
5
Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2011The Pharmaceuticals Division increased its core operating profit by 5% in constant currencies, driven by growth of
the underlying business, resource prioritisation and Operational Excellence cost savings. Further efficiency improvements
in general and administration costs were more than offset by 149 million Swiss francs of expenses for the new Branded
Pharmaceutical Product Fee in the US, part of the US healthcare reforms. Core operating profit growth in the Diagnostics
Division was 14% in constant currencies, mainly resulting from sales growth and various productivity improvement
programmes. The increase of general and administration costs in Corporate of 15% is due to the shift of certain Finance
functions from the Pharmaceuticals Division to Corporate.
Operational Excellence
On 17 November 2010 the Group announced the details of the Operational Excellence programme. The costs recognised
in 2011 of 0.9 billion Swiss francs mainly relate to site closure and disposal costs in the Pharmaceutical business. Site closure
and disposal costs totalled 407 million Swiss francs and were primarily due to the divestments of the sites at Palo Alto
(California), Boulder (Colorado), Madison (Wisconsin) and Kulmbach (Germany). In the first half of 2011 the Group announced
that it will not divest the chemical production facility in Florence (South Carolina) given the unfavourable market for chemical
production assets and the Group’s expected future capacity requirements for small molecules. The Pharmaceuticals Division
accounts for 850 million Swiss francs of these costs and 72 million Swiss francs relate to the Diagnostics Division.
East Japan Earthquake
The earthquake on 11 March 2011 damaged the Chugai production plant at Utsunomiya. Production there was temporarily
halted and was fully resumed by the end of August 2011. Some of Chugai’s contract manufacturers were also affected by
the earthquake and, as a result, product shipment control lasted until the end of October 2011. Chugai’s promotional
activities in Japan were affected, with events cancelled and sales employees diverted to ensure continued product supply
and information flow for customers. These factors had a certain negative impact on Chugai’s sales and profits in the second
half of 2011. Total costs incurred for write-offs of property, plant and equipment and inventories at Chugai in 2011 were
57 million Swiss francs, net of amounts received from insurance. The earthquake also resulted in temporary interruptions
in the supply of instruments by Hitachi, a key supplier to the Roche Professional Diagnostics business.
Treasury and taxation
Financial income was 0.6 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 28% at constant exchange rates, mainly due to foreign currency
devaluation effects in Venezuela in both 2011 and 2010. Financing costs were 2.2 billion Swiss francs, a decrease of 0.6 billion
Swiss francs, with interest costs being 10% lower at CER as debt is repaid. Tax expenses increased by 7% to 2.9 billion Swiss
francs. However, the Group’s effective core tax rate decreased to 21.3% compared to 21.9% in 2010, mainly due to the lower
tax rate in Basel, Switzerland, and the relatively lower percentage profit contribution from higher-tax jurisdictions.
Net income and Earnings per share
Net income increased by 26% at constant exchange rates driven by a solid operating performance, lower financing costs
and a lower tax rate and by overall lower non-core items such as no global restructuring charges for Genentech integration
in 2011 and lower charges for the Operational Excellence initiative. On a core basis, net income was 11% higher.
The increase in diluted EPS of 25% (CER) was due to the increase in net income, as described above. The Core EPS, which
excludes non-core items such as global restructuring charges and amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, increased
by 11% at constant exchange rates (decreased 4% in Swiss francs). Supplementary net income and EPS information is given
on pages 146–149. This includes calculations of Core EPS and reconciles the Core results to the Group’s published IFRS results.

During the first half of 2011 the Swiss franc strengthened against many currencies. Following the intervention of the
Swiss Central Bank this trend reversed in the second half of 2011. Overall these currency translation effects largely netted
out on balance sheet carrying values when consolidated into Swiss francs. In the Pharmaceuticals Division net working
capital decreased by 3% in constant currencies despite increased trade receivables within the public sector customers of
some Southern European countries, particularly Spain and Portugal, and continued sales growth in China. Long-term net
operating assets decreased by 1% in constant currencies as utilisation of provisions created for the Operational Excellence
restructuring programme were more than offset by lower property, plant and equipment following various site disposals.
In Diagnostics the increase in net working capital of 20% in constant currencies was driven by build-ups in trade receivable
in certain Southern European countries, increased inventory levels due to product launches and the build-up of Hitachi-
sourced instruments after the earthquake in Japan. The long-term net operating assets in constant currencies increased
by 1% as the creation of provisions has been partially offset by higher levels of property, plant and equipment.
The improvement in the net debt position was mainly due to the free cash flow of 3.9 billion Swiss francs, as described below.
For pensions the increase in the net pension liability reflects falling interest rates leading to the discounted defined benefit
obligation being higher.

The Group’s operating free cash flow remained strongly positive at 13.7 billion Swiss francs. There was an increase of 14%
in constant currencies (–3% in Swiss francs), driven by strong operating results partly offset by increases in net working
capital. Proceeds from site divestments and lower capital expenditure also contributed to the growth in operating free cash
flow. The free cash flow in 2011 decreased by 0.8 billion Swiss francs to 3.9 billion Swiss francs. This was primarily due to
the lower free cash flow in Swiss franc terms and higher dividend payments.

In 2011 Pharmaceuticals Division sales were stable in constant currencies with growth in most key products offsetting
negative impacts from healthcare reforms, austerity measures, pricing pressures and expected decreases in sales of certain
major medicines. Excluding Tamiflu, sales growth of the Pharmaceuticals Division was 1% in constant currencies and was
primarily driven by five products: Herceptin, MabThera/Rituxan, Lucentis, Actemra/RoActemra and Mircera. These products
represent 42% of the portfolio (2010: 37%) and together generated 1.7 billion Swiss francs of additional sales in 2011.
This growth was partly offset by lower sales of Tamiflu, Avastin, NeoRecormon/Epogin, Bonviva/Boniva and CellCept. The
US healthcare reforms, European austerity measures and a base effect from the Japanese biennial price cuts implemented
in April 2010 had a combined incremental negative impact in 2011 of 295 million Swiss francs compared to 2010, equivalent
to 1.2 percentage points on divisional sales growth.
Oncology continued to account for the majority of the division’s sales, with continued growth in Herceptin and MabThera/
Rituxan offsetting the expected decline in Avastin sales. In virology, sales of Tamiflu continued to decrease substantially,
and while overall Pegasys sales declined for the year, they began to recover in the second half following US launches of
new hepatitis C medicines that are used in combination with Pegasys. Sales in inflammation/autoimmune/transplantation
increased in constant currencies due to strong uptake of Actemra/RoActemra and growth of MabThera/Rituxan in
rheumatoid arthritis more than compensating for the negative impact of continued generic erosion of CellCept.

MabThera/Rituxan: for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHl), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Cll), rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) and ANCA-associated vasculitis. The sustained growth in the oncology segment was driven by continued strong
uptake of the new first-line maintenance indication in follicular lymphoma (a type of NHL) in Europe and the US, and by
further uptake in CLL. Sales growth of 14% in the International region, including key emerging markets such as China and
Brazil, was mainly due to the continued uptake in NHL indications. Sales in the RA segment were 1.0 billion Swiss francs
in 2011, an increase of 13% in constant currencies. Growth in this segment came from increased use in patients with an
inadequate response to treatment with tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and also from shortened repeat treatment intervals.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2011Avastin: for advanced colorectal, breast, lung, kidney and ovarian cancer, and for relapsed glioblastoma
(a type of brain tumour). The significant decline in overall sales was mainly due to regulatory and reimbursement
uncertainty in the US, beginning in 2010, regarding the use of Avastin for metastatic breast cancer. This led to lower sales
in the US throughout 2011 and also affected uptake for breast cancer in certain European and Latin American markets.
The US market share in all other indications remained stable. Lower sales in Europe were due primarily to government
austerity measures and price cuts, along with lower use for breast cancer. Market penetration in colorectal cancer remained
stable despite increasing competition. Use of the medicine in lung cancer grew slightly in a number of EU countries. The
approval by the EU in December 2011 of Avastin for front-line treatment of newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer is
expected to have a positive impact on sales in Europe from 2012 onwards. Growth of 11% in the International region reflects
strong uptake of Avastin in its colorectal and lung cancer indications, led by Latin America (up 18%) and Asia–Pacific
(up 34%), particularly in China following the launch for colorectal cancer in October 2010. Growth in Japan was driven by
continued good uptake in non-small cell lung cancer. The new metastatic breast cancer indication, approved in Japan in
September 2011, is also expected to contribute to future sales.
In November 2011 the US Food and Drug Administration issued a final decision revoking approval of Avastin for the
treatment of metastatic breast cancer. This followed a recommendation in July 2010 by an FDA expert panel, the agency’s
initial notice of revocation in December 2010, and an appeal in 2011 by Roche and Genentech against removal of the
indication. The FDA decision does not affect the medicine’s other approved indications in the US and elsewhere. Avastin
is currently approved in more than 80 markets worldwide, including the EU and (most recently) Japan, for breast cancer.

Herceptin: for HER2-positive breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic (advanced) stomach cancer. Global sales
growth was driven by expanded access in developing countries, together with increased and improved HER2 testing, and
continued uptake in HER2-positive stomach cancer. The International region grew at 22%, with demand especially strong in
Latin America and the Asia–Pacific region. Higher sales in the US primarily reflect good adoption of the medicine for stomach
cancer. The increase in Western Europe was due mainly to uptake in stomach cancer and higher penetration in the elderly
population in breast cancer, as well as enhanced penetration and quality of HER2 testing. Modest growth in Japan reflected
a reduction in promotional activities following the earthquake in March. The main growth contribution came from sales in
the HER2-positive breast cancer segment where Herceptin maintained its high market share. There was also initial uptake in
the new stomach cancer indication, which was approved by the Japanese authorities in March 2011.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Financial Reviewlucentis: for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion
(RVO). Sales in the US grew 23% in US dollar terms to 1.5 billion Swiss francs. The main factors were the growth of the
AMD market and the new RVO indication. In April 2011 the one-year results from the Comparisons of Age-related macular
degeneration Treatments Trial (CATT) were published, which compared Lucentis with off-label Avastin in patients with
wet AMD. This had a limited impact on US sales growth. The total Lucentis patient share in the wet AMD segment remained
stable in the US through the third and fourth quarters of 2011. This was due in part to reports in 2011 of safety concerns
regarding unapproved intravitreal use of Avastin in wet AMD. Lucentis is marketed outside the United States by Novartis.

Pegasys: for hepatitis B and C. An overall sales decline in 2011 was partly offset by renewed sales growth in the second
half of 2011 with an increase of 6% compared to the same period of 2010. This recovery followed the launches in mid-2011
of two new direct-acting hepatitis C medicines in the US (Merck’s Victrelis and Vertex’s Incivek). The new medicines are
designed to be given with a pegylated interferon and ribavirin (a regimen known as triple combination therapy). As the
leading pegylated interferon medication, Pegasys is well positioned to be the foundation for triple combination therapy.
In Europe and elsewhere patients and their doctors have been delaying the start of hepatitis C treatment in anticipation
of the availability and reimbursement of triple combination therapy, expected to increase in 2012. While these treatment
deferrals have resulted in a contraction of the hepatitis C segment in most mature markets in recent years, Pegasys has
continued to expand its leading market share in the US, key EU countries and Japan.
In 2011 Roche and Merck & Co. established strategic, non-exclusive agreements to improve the treatment, diagnosis and
awareness of chronic hepatitis C. Under the agreements, Roche and Genentech will include Victrelis (boceprevir) as part
of their promotion to healthcare professionals on the use of Pegasys in a triple combination regimen. The Pegasys pre-filled
pen/ProClick Auto-Injector, which makes administering Pegasys even simpler, was approved in the EU and the US in 2011
and is now being rolled out.

Xeloda: for colorectal, stomach and breast cancer. Sales increased 8% in constant currencies to 1.4 billion Swiss francs.
Growth was driven primarily by strong demand in the US, China and Brazil with increased US sales partly due to shortages
of certain alternative cancer medicines. Sales in Western Europe were impacted by government-mandated price cuts in key
markets, while the decline in Japan was primarily due to the effects of the East Japan Earthquake.

Tarceva: for advanced non-small cell lung and pancreatic cancer. The overall sales increase was due primarily to strong
growth in the International region, especially in China, Brazil and South Korea, driven by uptake in the second-line treatment
of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Growth in the US reflects continued growth in the NSCLC first-line maintenance
indication and growth in the second-line NSCLC segment. In the highly competitive Japanese market, the increase in sales
was primarily due to the uptake of Tarceva for second-line NSCLC and oncologists’ increasing confidence in the benefits
of treatment with the medication. Pricing pressure and competitive challenges negatively affected sales in Western Europe,
offsetting the positive impact of volume gains from initial launches in the new first-line, epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) mutation-positive, metastatic NSCLC indication.

CellCept: for the prevention of solid organ transplant rejection. Sales again declined sharply in 2011 due to continued
generic erosion in the US and Western Europe following patent expiry in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Sales in many countries
of the International region were also negatively affected by price pressure and increased use of generics. Continued growth
in Japan reflects the position of CellCept as the standard of care in its approved indications.

NeoRecormon/Epogin: for anemia/renal anemia. In a highly competitive market the Group’s overall market share in
the anemia franchise was only slightly down for the year. Combined sales of Roche’s NeoRecormon and Chugai’s Epogin
(epoetin beta) declined 23% in constant currencies. In the Western Europe and International regions sales were lower
due to increasing biosimilar competition and a market decline in the cancer–related anemia segment, while competitive
pressure and a lower reimbursement price resulted in reduced sales of Epogin in Japan.
14
Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewThe sustained decline in sales of NeoRecormon and Epogin was partly offset by strong growth in sales of the longer-acting
erythropoiesis-stimulating agent Mircera (methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta), which rose 50% at constant exchange
rates to 344 million Swiss francs. Much of this growth is due to the increasing number of patients switching to or starting
treatment with Mircera in place of NeoRecormon/Epogin. The strongest contributions to higher Mircera sales came from
Japan, where the product was launched by Chugai in July 2011, and from the International region, which now accounts for
about 30% of total Mircera sales.

Bonviva/Boniva: for osteoporosis. Sales in Western Europe were lower due to the entry of generics into the market
together with pricing and reimbursement issues. The decrease in the US reflects falling market demand and reserve
adjustments. There was strong growth in Asia–Pacific, 65% in constant currencies, which was led by South Korea. This
was offset by lower sales in the rest of the International region, notably in some Eastern European countries and Brazil.

Actemra/RoActemra: for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Sales continued to grow
strongly in all approved indications and all regions. Sales increased particularly in the US, where Actemra continues to gain
market share, and also in Western Europe, Japan and Latin America. Marketing and reimbursement approvals in additional
countries continue to expand patient access to Actemra/RoActemra. Sustained growth in the US and elsewhere was due to
the uptake in later lines of therapy, depending on the approved indication. Sales in Japan grew strongly due to the increasing
use of Actemra in first-line and later lines of therapy, supported by recognition of the high remission rates achieved with
the medicine in RA.

continued to decline strongly in 2011 reflecting not only a baseline effect from 2010 but also moderate influenza seasons in
both hemispheres. In 2010 there were significantly higher sales to governments, particularly in Japan and in the International
region, notably in Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico. The limited sales to governments in 2011 were primarily driven by
the replacement of expiring pandemic stockpiles.

Zelboraf: for BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma. The US Food and Drug Administration approved Zelboraf in
August 2011, enabling Genentech to launch this new targeted cancer medicine in the United States less than four months
after the marketing application was filed. The FDA simultaneously approved Roche Diagnostics’ cobas BRAF V600 Mutation
Test, a companion diagnostic used to identify patients for whom treatment with Zelboraf is appropriate. Initial sales of
Zelboraf have been strong and broad payer coverage has already been achieved. Marketing approval was also obtained in
Switzerland and Brazil in the fourth quarter of 2011. In December 2011 the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) unanimously recommended that Zelboraf be granted full EU marketing approval.
Marketing applications have been filed in a number of other countries, including Australia and New Zealand, where rates
of malignant melanoma are high.

United States. Sales grew by 2% in US dollar terms with growth driven by Lucentis, MabThera/Rituxan, Actemra and
Herceptin, more than offsetting the decline in US Avastin sales. In addition the impact of the US healthcare reforms led to
a reduction of sales of approximately 355 million US dollars (315 million Swiss francs) in 2011 through increased rebates,
affecting all major products, compared to 247 million US dollars (258 million Swiss francs) in 2010.
Western Europe. Sales decreased by 3% in constant currencies despite the growth in the oncology products MabThera/
Rituxan and Herceptin and further uptake of Actemra/RoActemra. The decline was due to lower Avastin sales, the continuing
impact of generic erosion on CellCept and Bonviva/Boniva sales and lower sales of NeoRecormon in the highly competitive
renal anemia market. In addition there was an estimated 400 million euros (494 million Swiss francs) negative impact from
European austerity measures, compared to 225 million euros (311 million Swiss francs) in 2010.
16
Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewJapan. A decrease of 6% in sales in Japanese yen terms was due primarily to the direct and indirect effects of the earthquake
in March and a further decline in government purchases of Tamiflu. Emergency relief efforts and the rapid implementation
by Chugai of a recovery programme to ensure product supplies and restore production took priority over marketing activities
until normal operations were resumed towards the end of 2011. To ensure uninterrupted supplies of medicines to patients,
shipment controls were introduced for a number of key products immediately following the earthquake. In some cases these
controls were maintained until well into the fourth quarter, with promotional activities reduced accordingly. In addition, in
the first half of 2011 there was still a residual effect from the mandatory two-yearly pharmaceutical price cuts implemented
in April 2010. Growth in Avastin (7%), the launch of Mircera and higher Actemra sales (24%) were more than offset by lower
sales of Epogin (–28%), Pegasys (–21%) and Kytril (–38%).
International. Asia–Pacific showed particularly strong growth, led by the oncology franchise, with the top selling products
being Herceptin (36%), MabThera/Rituxan (15%) and Avastin (34%). China was the main driver, with overall sales growth of
35%. Growth in Latin America was also mainly due to the oncology products, especially Herceptin (28%), MabThera/Rituxan
(21%) and Avastin (18%). In Mexico there was a negative impact from biosimilar competition. Actemra/RoActemra sales also
continued to grow in Latin America, increasing by 130%. The underlying sales growth in Brazil and South Korea was more
than offset by the significantly lower Tamiflu sales (excluding Tamiflu, growth was 12% and 17%, respectively). Excluding
Tamiflu, total sales in the E7 key emerging markets grew by 13%. Sales excluding Tamiflu in the CEMAI sub-region declined
due to political developments in North Africa and Middle East, as well as some price pressure in Eastern European markets.

Cost of sales on a core basis decreased by 2% in constant currencies mainly as a result of lower royalty expenses. As a
percentage of sales, cost of sales increased slightly to 21.5% (2010: 21.4%). The increase in manufacturing cost of goods
sold and period costs was mainly due to product mix effects, start-up activities for product launches and some inventory
write-offs in the second half of 2011. Royalty expenses were 14% lower mainly arising from expiring royalty obligations
for Herceptin in major EU countries beginning late in 2010, as well as lower sales of Tamiflu and contractual changes on
US sales of Bonviva/Boniva. These were partly offset by back royalty expenses of 99 million Swiss francs related to the
Rituxan arbitration (see Note 24 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). Expenses for collaboration and profit-sharing
agreements decreased, in part due to the estimated 38 million Swiss francs that would be recoverable in respect of the
Rituxan arbitration mentioned above. Site closure and disposal costs in the manufacturing and logistics area of 167 million
Swiss francs were recorded as part of the Operational Excellence programme. In addition, due to the East Japan Earthquake,
47 million Swiss francs costs were reported for impairments, repairs and maintenance of plants and write-offs of raw
materials and intermediates at Chugai.

and continued rollouts of Actemra/RoActemra in rheumatoid arthritis. Costs were also incurred for the continued support of
Pegasys, Xeloda and Tarceva. Further significant bad debt provision expenses totalling 121 million Swiss francs were incurred
in 2011, in particular for Southern European countries. Non-core costs of 65 million Swiss francs were recorded as part of

Core costs were lower by 2% due to resource prioritisation and savings from the Operational Excellence programme.
Research and development costs as a percentage of sales were 21.9% compared to 22.0% in 2010. Oncology remained
the main focus area, and there were higher investments in Central Nervous System and Virology, which were offset by
lower lifecycle investments in Metabolism and Inflammation. Operational Excellence costs of 162 million Swiss francs relate
primarily to site disposals and property, plant and equipment impairments. The 2011 impairment charge for intangible assets
relates to some assets acquired from alliance transactions or acquisitions. The majority of the large impairment in 2010
arose from project terminations from the Operational Excellence programme. In addition, the Pharmaceuticals Division spent
236 million Swiss francs on in-licensed and acquired pipeline compounds and technologies, which were capitalised as
intangible assets.

Core costs increased by 10%, mainly due to the new Branded Pharmaceutical Product Fee in the US, which had a cost
impact of 149 million Swiss francs. Excluding this fee, constant currency core costs decreased by 6%. This was driven by
lower administration costs due to savings and the further organisational shift of certain Finance functions to Corporate.
The non-core costs in the general and administration area included costs of 456 million Swiss francs relating to Operational
Excellence, which consists mainly of site disposal costs for the US sites at Boulder, Colorado and Madison, Wisconsin and
the site at Kulmbach in Germany. These costs were partly offset by a gain on disposal of the site at Palo Alto in California.
Additionally there were various IT-related expenses for Operational Excellence. Alliances and business combinations
include 43 million Swiss francs related to the reversal of provisions for contingent consideration arrangements for business
combinations.

The absolute amount of the movement between the 2011 and 2010 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2011 transactions
(translated at average rates for 2010) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2011 transactions include non-cash movements
and therefore the movements in this table are not the same as amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only includes the cash movements). A full
consolidated balance sheet is given on page 45 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given
above is on page 151.
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. During the first half of 2011 the Swiss franc strengthened against
many currencies. Following the intervention of the Swiss Central Bank this trend reversed in the second half of 2011. As a
result at the end of 2011, the US dollar is at the same exchange rate as at the start of the year and the euro is only slightly
weaker against the Swiss franc. The Japanese yen strengthened against the Swiss franc year-on-year, while the Swiss franc
strengthened against some other currencies such as the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira. Overall these effects almost
completely netted out on total net operating assets in the Pharmaceuticals Division when consolidated into Swiss francs.
Net working capital. The decrease of 3% in constant currencies was mainly due to decreases in inventories and other
receivables and prepaid expenses. The balance sheet value of inventories decreased mainly due to inventory write-offs
made in the second half of 2011. There was a certain build-up in key growth markets such as China and the Asia–Pacific and
Latin America regions. Trade receivables increased by 1%, with the main factors being increases in public sector receivables
in some Southern European countries, particularly in Spain and Portugal, and also the continued growth of the business
in China. These increases more than offset the decrease of 344 million Swiss francs following the settlement of public sector
trade receivables with government bonds in Greece. Payables increased slightly with accrued royalty liabilities increasing.
long-term net operating assets. Property, plant and equipment decreased mainly due to the various site divestments from
the Operational Excellence programme. At the same time there were additions from the completion of new manufacturing
facilities and the expansion of technical research and development facilities in Basel, Switzerland, and Penzberg, Germany.
Goodwill and intangibles increased mainly due to the acquisition of Anadys Pharmaceuticals. The decrease in provisions is
mainly related to the settlement of obligations from the Operational Excellence programme.

1) A detailed breakdown is provided on page 150.
The Pharmaceuticals Division generated a strong operating free cash flow of 12.9 billion Swiss francs. The increase of
16% in constant currencies compared to 2010 was driven by the strong operating profit performance and lower capital
expenditure which more than offset the increases in working capital. Trade receivables increased during 2011, partly as
a result of continued sales growth in China. Another factor is the significant increase in trade receivables within the public
sector customers of Southern European countries, particularly Spain and Portugal. Measures are being taken to improve
collections in these countries, including intense communication with customers, negotiations of payment plans, charging
of interest for late payments, and legal action. From a cash flow perspective, cash invested in inventories increased due
to the growth in key growth markets, such as Asia–Pacific, Latin America, and especially China. Payables increased due
to increases in accrued royalty liabilities. Operating profit cash adjustments decreased mainly due to the significant cash
outflows for the utilisation of Operational Excellence programme provisions and lower depreciation, amortisation and
impairments. These were partially offset by the cash received from disposals.

Sales
The Diagnostics business continued to increase sales significantly above the in vitro diagnostics (IVD) global market
with a growth of 6% in constant currencies over 2010. Professional Diagnostics with 9% sales growth, leveraged by
Immunodiagnostics, and Tissue Diagnostics with 15% sales growth, driven by sales in the advanced staining market, were
the main growth contributors. Both business areas were growing at around twice the rate of their respective markets.
Diabetes Care sales increased to 2,675 million Swiss francs, an increase of 2% in constant currencies. Sales in Molecular
Diagnostics totalled 1,094 million Swiss francs, an increase of 4%, driven by the virology segment. Applied Science sales
decreased by 3%, due to the year-on-year decline in H1N1 influenza virus testing, increasing competition in sequencing,
and a slowdown in research funding.

Professional Diagnostics. Sales grew at almost double the rate of the global market, with especially strong growth in
emerging markets. In early 2011 Roche Professional Diagnostics took the leading position in its market which includes IVD
products for clinical laboratories and hospital/ambulatory point-of-care testing. The key drivers for this growth were the
growth of 13% in the immunoassays business, where Roche has the broadest menu offering in the industry with 95 tests,
and growth of 7% in the clinical chemistry business. Instrument placements as a whole were again up despite temporary
disruptions in the supply of instruments by our manufacturing partner Hitachi High Technologies, due to the East Japan
Earthquake. There was further growth in coagulation monitoring business of 9% from the ongoing conversion of patients
to self-testing. This led to a further increase of Professional Diagnostics’ leading market share in this sector, despite the
introduction of new anti-coagulant therapies in the market.
In the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and North America regions the business maintained growth above market
levels, with particularly increased market penetration in North America. In the International region there was continued
above-market growth, led by Asia–Pacific (21%) and Latin America (15%). There were further investments in China, and
this contributed to a 27% growth in 2011, which strengthened Roche Professional Diagnostics’ market leadership position
in this country.
During the year the business launched seven new immunoassays and the cobas c702 clinical chemistry module. Amongst
these new immunoassays are the HBsAg quant assay that determines hepatitis B viral load for Pegasys therapy, the HE4
immunoassay that helps to detect early ovarian cancer, and Vitamin D Total for the measurement of vitamins D and D .

During 2011, the business completed the acquisition of PVT, a leader in laboratory automation and workflow, and in early
2012 acquired Verum Diagnostica, a leading company in platelet function testing.

Diabetes Care. Sales increased slightly in an environment impacted by price pressure, slow volume growth and increasing
regulatory requirements, particularly in the US. Growth in the Rest of the World regions was partly offset by reduced
sales in North America. Despite the challenging market, Diabetes Care remains the leader in global blood glucose (bG)
monitoring, holding close to one third of the global market. The main growth drivers were the new generation of Accu-Chek
bG monitoring systems and the Accu-Chek Combo, a combined insulin pump and bG meter. Good sales development of
these products in EMEA and the Rest of the World regions helped to strengthen Roche Diabetes Care’s market position,
with especially strong growth in Asia–Pacific (13%) and Latin America (13%). In the US the decline in sales was mainly due
to the postponed launch of the latest additions to the new Accu-Chek portfolio.
The FDA’s clearance of the new maltose-independent chemistry for the Accu-Chek Aviva Plus test strip in the third quarter
marked the first step in bringing the new portfolio to the US. This is expected to drive future growth in this key market. In late
2011, Roche Diabetes Care started launching the next generation of its strip-free bG meter Accu-Chek Mobile in Australia
and the Netherlands. In the insulin delivery segment, insulin pumps sales grew driven mainly by the increased number of
patients on Accu-Chek Combo, whereas sales of infusion sets were negatively impacted by the voluntary recall of the Accu-
Chek FlexLink Plus.

Molecular Diagnostics. The growth in sales was due to the strong performance in the North America and the Rest of the
World regions, notably in the United States and China. Roche Molecular Diagnostics retains its leadership position in the
global molecular diagnostics market, with close to one third of the global market. With a large and expanding test menu, the
business’ main sales growth came from the HIV and HBV viral load tests and the blood screening business, which grew by
5%. In the EMEA region, in spite of the pricing pressures on the virology and blood screening segments, the overall business
remained stable with a majority share of the market.
With the FDA’s approval of the human papillomavirus (HPV) test in April 2011, the business entered into the largest single
and fastest growing molecular testing market. The HPV test experienced positive uptake in the EU, where it had been
previously launched, and won the tender from Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden for the first large pilot project in the
EU for HPV primary screening. In the US partnerships and contracts were signed with major laboratories and the physician
sales force started to expand HPV business.
The business area continued to build its novel oncology portfolio, with the launch of tests for detecting cancer-related
mutations of the BRAF (melanoma), EGFR (lung cancer) and KRAS (colorectal cancer) genes complementing Roche’s
portfolio of companion diagnostics. The cobas BRAF test has seen a strong market uptake, and is now available in Europe,
the Americas and Asia–Pacific. Further developments in personalised healthcare came from the partnerships with large
pharmaceutical companies, including Merck and Clovis, as well as continued internal Roche projects on future assays for
the detection of biomarkers.

Applied Science. The sales decline was driven by the EMEA and North America regions and also Japan, and was due to
the slowdown in research funding, increasing competition in gene sequencing and the year-on-year effect from large orders
for H1N1 influenza testing in early 2010. This effect was especially marked in the Asia–Pacific region, where there was a sales
decline of 3%. Excluding this effect, sales in Asia–Pacific increased by 7%.
The Custom Biotech and Biochemicals business, which accounts for approximately 43% of Applied Science’s revenues,
continued its healthy growth with an increase in sales of 5%. This business supplies various products to the healthcare
industry including specialty biochemicals and a new bioprocess analyser. Instrument placements declined in the Genomics
and PCR analysis businesses, leading to a 15% and 2% reduction in sales, respectively. Despite this some products
continued to gain market share and generate growth. These include the test kits for the GS Junior benchtop system for
gene sequencing, test kits for the MagNA Pure 96 for DNA sample preparation and the SeqCap microarrays for targeted
sequencing. A major launch during the year was LightCycler Nano, a small and affordable instrument for automised PCR
analysis.

Tissue Diagnostics. Sales grew substantially ahead of the market in all regions, reinforcing the business’ leadership position
in tissue-based cancer diagnostics. In EMEA and Japan sales grew at more than double the market rate, reflecting intensified
uptake of Roche Tissue Diagnostics’ automated solutions and novel advanced staining tests in these regions.
Growth was driven by increasing instrument placements, as well as increasing sales in immunohistochemistry (IHC) and
in situ hybridisation (ISH) assays that are used to detect proteins and genes in tissue samples. Including 29 new antibodies
for IHC testing, the business’ industry-leading test menu now includes more than 220 ready-to-use antibody tests.
The newly launched OptiView system improves sensitivity and visualisation in IHC assays, enabling pathologists to improve
the detection of biomarkers in tissue samples. In June 2011, Roche Tissue Diagnostics launched its HER2 Dual ISH test
in the US supporting personalised breast cancer treatment. The test has seen a rapid uptake worldwide and is achieving
a leadership position in the EU and other markets. Combined with the HER2 (4B5) IHC test and the Companion Algorithm
HER2 (4B5) analytical imaging software, the business now offers the only complete HER2 diagnostic workflow for
laboratories. During 2011 the business completed the acquisition of mtm laboratories, a leader in cervical cancer in vitro
diagnostics.

Sales continued to grow in all regions. The Asia-Pacific region achieved strong growth of 17%, led by China growing
27% and South Korea growing 16%. This growth was driven mainly by Professional Diagnostics but partly offset by lower
Applied Science sales due to the non-recurrence of orders in the first half of 2010 related to H1N1 influenza tests. Despite
pricing challenges in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and North America, sales in these regions grew by 3%
and 4%, respectively, driven by Professional Diagnostics. In North America, the division’s market share continued to grow
in the in vitro diagnostics business with the strong sales in this area more than offsetting the decline in Diabetes Care
sales following from postponed launches in the US. In Japan the good performances of Professional Diagnostics and Tissue
Diagnostics were partly offset by lower sales in Applied Science resulting in a total sales growth of 6%.

The sales growth in the E7 emerging markets was led by China, with contributions from Russia and South Korea. The
strong growth in China was driven by the demographic change and the healthcare reform which foresees an investment
of 120 billion US dollars in primary healthcare over the next three years and provides a national insurance plan for more than
90% of the population. Growth in China was particularly strong in the Professional Diagnostics and Molecular Diagnostics
businesses. The significant growth in Russia was achieved by winning some major tenders, mainly for Professional
Diagnostics and Molecular Diagnostics, related to the Russian Healthcare Modernisation Programme.

The growth of core costs was lower than the sales growth resulting in a lower cost-of-sales ratio of 41.7%. Previous
cost reduction initiatives, such as the centralisation of logistics services, harmonisation of technical services practices
and renegotiations of supplier contracts, continued to have a positive impact. These partly compensated for the higher
depreciation, installation costs and technical service costs from the continued investments to expand market share through
meter placements and further increase in the installed instrument base. The decrease in royalty expenses to 138 million
Swiss francs was due to patent expirations for certain in-licensed intellectual property. As part of the Operational Excellence
programme costs of 27 million Swiss francs were incurred mainly relating to the employee-related costs at Graz in Austria,
and Rotkreuz and Burgdorf in Switzerland. The decrease in amortisation of 7% in constant currencies is mainly due to certain
assets becoming fully amortised which was partly offset with the amortisation of the recently acquired intangible assets
of Medingo and mtm laboratories. In the second half of 2011 there was an impairment of 54 million Swiss francs booked for
intangibles in the sequencing and array businesses.

Marketing and distribution costs increased reflecting higher costs in Molecular Diagnostics, notably in the microbiology area
and for the launch of the cobas HPV DNA test. In Professional Diagnostics the immunoassay and clinical chemistry segments
remain the highest contributors, in particular due to increased distribution costs following the East Japan Earthquake
that led to a change from shipping to air freight. The increase in 2011 also comes from higher marketing support for the
advanced staining assay portfolio in Tissue Diagnostics, and the work flow automation and coagulation monitoring sectors in
Professional Diagnostics. On a core basis, marketing and distribution costs as a percentage of sales were 24.7% compared
to 24.1% in 2010.

The absolute amount of the movement between the 2011 and 2010 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2011 transactions (translated
at average rates for 2010) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2011 transactions include non-cash movements and therefore
the movements in this table are not the same as amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only include the cash movements). A full consolidated balance

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewCurrency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. During the first half of 2011 the Swiss franc strengthened against
many currencies. Following the intervention of the Swiss Central Bank, this trend reversed in the second half of 2011. As a
result at the end of 2011, the US dollar is at the same exchange rate as at the start of the year and the euro is only slightly
weaker against the Swiss franc. The Japanese yen strengthened against the Swiss franc year-on-year, while the Swiss franc
strengthened against some other currencies such as the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira. Overall these effects largely
netted out on total net operating assets in the Diagnostics Division when consolidated into Swiss francs.
Net working capital. The 20% increase in constant currencies was driven by increases in receivables and inventories.
The main factors behind these increases were build-ups in trade receivable in certain Southern European countries and
increased inventory levels due to product launches like the cobas 8000, inventory increases related to acquisitions and
to the build-up of Hitachi-sourced analysers after earthquake in Japan. Receivables decreased by 64 million Swiss francs
following the settlement of public sector trade receivables with government bonds in Greece. Payables were also higher
due to accelerated efforts to increase and harmonise supplier payment terms.
long-term net operating assets. The total balance in constant currencies increased by 1%. The investments in property,
plant and equipment, notably for instrument placements with customers, were partially offset by decreases in intangible
assets and by increased provisions, mainly for Operational Excellence employee-related costs.

The operating free cash flow of the Diagnostics Division decreased 7% in constant currencies and 23% upon translation into
Swiss francs compared to 2010. The increase in the operating profit was more than offset by increases in net working capital,
which arose from increases in trade receivables and overall higher inventory levels, partly offset by higher payables. The
increases in trade receivables were due to longer settlement times, particularly in Southern Europe, and reduced factoring
activities. The higher inventory levels resulted from the launch and growth of key products in Professional Diagnostics and
Tissue Diagnostics and higher stock for products sourced from Japan. Payables were higher due to accelerated efforts to
increase and harmonise supplier payment terms. Overall these had a negative effect on the operating free cash flow margin
of 2.8 percentage points.

General and administration costs increased by 15% in constant currencies due to higher administration expenses of 12%
in constant currencies as a result of the shift of certain Finance functions from the Pharmaceuticals Division to Corporate.
Total costs on an IFRS basis grew at 17% in constant currencies to 453 million Swiss francs (2010: 394 million Swiss francs)
at a higher rate than core costs, as the 2011 Operational Excellence restructuring expenses of 18 million Swiss francs were
higher compared to last year’s expenses.
Corporate operating free cash flow showed an increase in the net outflow driven by the higher allocated administration
expenses due to continuous changes in the organisational structure in 2011.

In 2011 the average rates for the euro, the US dollar and all other major currencies were lower against the Swiss franc
compared to 2010. For sales these developments resulted in a negative impact of 11 percentage points translating the
growth of 1% in constant currencies in a decline of 10% in Swiss franc terms. In core operating profit the negative impact
is even higher with 15 percentage points due to the different currency structure of operating costs and of sales. The 6%
core operating profit growth in constant currencies translates into a decline of 9%. The currency translation exposure for
the operating profit is mitigated by the Group having a majority of its cost base located outside Switzerland. The sensitivity
of Group sales and core operating profit in absolute terms to a 1% movement in foreign currencies against the Swiss franc
during 2011 are shown in the table below.

The Group’s revenues are primarily generated from sales of products to customers. Such revenues are mainly received
in the local currency of the customer’s home market, although in certain emerging markets invoicing is made in major
international currencies such as the US dollar and euro. The costs of sales and marketing and also some administration costs
follow the same currency pattern as sales. The majority of research and development activities are incurred at the Group’s
global research facilities, and therefore the costs are more concentrated in US dollars, Swiss francs and euros. General and
administration costs tend to be incurred mainly at central locations in the US, Switzerland and Germany. Obviously the large
majority of Chugai’s costs are denominated in Japanese yen.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewFinancial income
Financial income was 647 million Swiss francs, an increase of 28% at constant exchange rates (16% in Swiss francs). Interest
income and income from debt securities were 71 million Swiss francs and remained at low levels due to the low prevailing
interest rates. The net foreign exchange result was a gain of 20 million Swiss francs compared to a loss of 147 million Swiss
francs in 2010. The improvement is due to the foreign exchange gains of 45 million Swiss francs in Venezuela following
the enactment of a law allowing the Group to benefit from pre-devaluation treatment for certain transactions. This contrasts
to 2010 where the Group incurred losses of 74 million Swiss francs caused by the currency devaluation in Venezuela.
Net income from equity securities was 64 million Swiss francs, down by 30 million Swiss francs. Expected returns on pension
plan assets were 500 million Swiss francs, down 3% at CER, mostly due to overall lower assumptions for expected returns.
A full analysis of financial income is given in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Financing costs
Financing costs were 2,228 million Swiss francs, a decrease of 601 million Swiss francs or 10% at constant exchange rates
(21% in Swiss francs). The main driver was a decrease in interest expenses of 408 million Swiss francs, a decrease of 10% in
constant currencies. This reflects both the continued repayment of the debt incurred to finance the Genentech transaction
and a translation effect from the stronger Swiss franc. Financing costs also include 172 million Swiss francs for the early
redemption of debt, compared to 255 million Swiss francs in 2010, as described in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. The interest cost of pension plans was 565 million Swiss francs, a decrease of 5% at CER, mostly due to lower
discount rates. A full analysis of financing costs is given in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income taxes
The Group’s effective core tax rate decreased by 0.6 percentage points to 21.3% in 2011 (2010: 21.9%). This decrease is due
mainly to the relatively lower percentage profit contribution from higher tax jurisdictions, notably in Japan, and a decrease of
the statutory tax rate in Basel, Switzerland. In addition to the drivers mentioned above, the IFRS effective tax rate decreased
due to the increased tax benefits from equity compensation plans compared to 2010. Full details of the Group’s income tax
positions are given in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2011Financial position
The decrease in net debt is mainly due to the positive free cash flow generation, as is more fully described in the net debt
section below. The increase in the net pension liability reflects falling interest rates leading to the discounted defined benefit
obligation being higher, with further details given below in the pensions section. The net tax liability decreased mainly due
to the deferred tax benefit from increased net pension liabilities recognised in equity as well as the fact that taxes paid
exceeded the total income tax expense for 2011. The net derivative position decreased to 0.2 billion Swiss francs, mainly due
to lower valuations on the cross-currency swaps following a stronger US dollar compared to euro. Interest payable relates
mostly to bonds and notes with coupon payment dates in March 2012, and the decline is due to debt repayments in 2011.
At 31 December 2011 the Group held financial long-term assets with a market value of 0.4 billion Swiss francs, down 15%
compared to 2010. These consist mostly of holdings in biotechnology companies which were acquired in the context of
licensing transactions or scientific collaborations.
Free cash flow
The cash outflow from treasury activities increased slightly to 1.5 billion Swiss francs mostly due to higher foreign exchange
losses and lower gains from marketable securities partially offset by lower interest payments. Total taxes paid in 2011 were
2.6 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 5% at constant exchange rates. This was due to prepayments of tax and settlement of
certain outstanding tax positions, partly offset by lower tax payments at Chugai. Total dividends paid in 2011 were 5.7 billion
Swiss francs, an increase of 0.5 billion Swiss francs compared to 2010, reflecting the 10% increase of the Roche Group
dividend.

1) US dollar denominated debt includes those bonds and notes denominated in euros, Swiss francs and pounds sterling that were swapped into US dollars,
and therefore in the financial statements have economic characteristics equivalent to US dollar-denominated bonds and notes.
The net debt position of the Group at the end of 2011 was 15.6 billion Swiss francs, a decrease of 3.6 billion Swiss francs from
19.2 billion Swiss francs at the start of the year. This was mainly due to the free cash flow of 3.9 billion Swiss francs described
above. An outflow of 0.5 billion Swiss francs came from transactions in own equity instruments which were executed to
cover the exposure from equity compensation plans issued to employees. In addition 0.5 billion Swiss francs were paid in
business combinations. During the year the Group received 0.3 billion Swiss francs from hedging and collateral agreements,
which were set up following the financing of the Genentech transaction.
As previously described in the 2010 and 2009 annual financial statements, when issuing the debt to finance the
Genentech transaction, the Group entered into derivative contracts with third parties to hedge the foreign exchange
risk arising from bonds and notes issued in currencies other than US dollar. The total exposure hedged at issuance of
these bonds and notes was approximately 25 billion Swiss francs (see Note 26). Collateral agreements were entered with
the derivative counterparties to mitigate counterparty risk. During 2011 cash collateral of 0.1 billion Swiss francs was
delivered to Roche. This increased the cash collateral balance in favour of Roche of 0.1 billion Swiss francs at the start of
the year to 0.2 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2011. The collateral balance in relation to the hedges on the non-US
dollar-denominated bonds and notes is mainly sensitive to the foreign exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro,
but also to the Swiss franc and pound sterling. Currently the collateral balance moves by approximately 150 million US
dollars if all of these foreign exchange rates move by 1% simultaneously. Collateral volatility will decrease to less than
100 million dollars for each 1% movement in foreign exchange rates by mid-2013 as the non-US dollar-denominated bonds
and notes will be repaid. The realised gain on derivatives during 2011 was 0.2 billion Swiss francs and relates mainly to
hedges on the non-US dollar-denominated bonds and notes.
The various debt repayments of 4.0 billion Swiss francs during 2011 largely absorbed the free cash flow of 3.9 billion Swiss
francs. However, this had no significant impact on the net debt position.
Full details of the Group’s marketable securities, cash and debt positions are given in Notes 19, 20 and 26 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2011Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefit plans are classified as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions into
a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation to pay further
contributions. In 2011 expenses for the Group’s defined contribution plans were 303 million Swiss francs (2010: 305 million
Swiss francs).
All other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’, even if the Group’s potential obligation is minor or has a relatively
remote possibility of arising. The funding and asset management of the Group’s various defined benefit plans is overseen
at a corporate level. Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by payments from the
Group and by employees, but in some cases the plan is unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly
from its own financial resources.

Funding status. Overall the funding status of the Group’s defined benefit plans decreased to 85% compared to 93% at the
start of the year. This decrease came mainly from an increase in the defined benefit obligation arising from a fall in discount
rates in comparison to the end of 2010. Plan assets were broadly stable, with company contributions increasing to 293 million
Swiss francs in 2011, compared to 196 million Swiss francs in 2010. The Group continues to closely monitor the funded status
of its major pension funds. In addition to cash injections, the Group has initiated plan changes in several local pension plans,
with, for example, some of the major pension funds removing early retirement incentives. The Group continues to introduce
more flexible retirement models to better accommodate the diverse needs of an ageing workforce.
Expenses recorded in income statement. Total pension expenses in 2011 relating to the Group’s defined benefit plans
were 399 million Swiss francs compared to 330 million Swiss francs in 2010. The increase of 21% is primarily due to lower
curtailment gains of 15 million Swiss francs compared to 95 million Swiss francs in 2010. In addition there were 8 million
Swiss francs of past service costs in 2011 against 29 million Swiss francs past service income in 2010. These resulted mostly
from various one-off plan amendments across the Group. Based on the revised actuarial assumptions at the end of 2011,
total pension expenses for 2012 are expected to be broadly stable compared to 2011.
Full details of the Group’s pensions and other post-employment benefits are given in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2011Proposed dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing an increase of 3% in the dividend for 2011 to 6.80 Swiss francs per share and non-voting
equity security (2010: 6.60 Swiss francs) for approval at the Annual General Meeting. This is the 25th consecutive increase
in the dividend. If the dividend proposal is approved by shareholders, dividend payments on the shares and non-voting equity
securities in issue will amount to 5.9 billion Swiss francs (2010: 5.7 billion Swiss francs), resulting in a pay-out ratio (based
on core net income) of 55.3% (2010: 52%). Based on the prices at year-end 2011, the dividend yield on the Roche share is 4.1%
(2010: 4.6%) and the yield on the non-voting equity security is 4.3% (2010: 4.8%). Further information on the Roche securities
is given on pages 152–153 of the Finance Report.

Roche bonds and notes
To finance the Genentech transaction in 2009, the Group issued bonds and notes equivalent to 48.2 billion Swiss francs
in February and March of that year. Of the debt raised in early 2009, 42% had already been repaid by 31 December 2011.
This includes:
an early redemption of 1.0 billion US dollars of notes that were originally due 1 March 2014 on 24 March 2011.
a repurchase of 962 million euros of notes originally due 4 March 2013 on 28 June 2011 following a tender offer.
a repurchase of 302 million Swiss francs of notes originally due 23 March 2012 on 2 November 2011 following a tender

1) Total translated at 31 December 2011 exchange rates.
2) The proceeds from these bonds and notes were swapped into US dollars, and therefore in the financial statements the bonds and notes have economic
characteristics equivalent to US dollar-denominated bonds and notes.
The Group plans to meet its debt obligations using existing liquid funds as well as cash generated from the ongoing business.
In 2011 the free cash flow was 3.9 billion Swiss francs, which includes the cash generated from operations, as well as
payment of interest, tax and dividends. In the second half of 2011 free cash flow was an inflow of 4.9 billion Swiss francs,
while in the first half of 2011 free cash flow was an outflow of 1.0 billion Swiss francs, which included 5.6 billion Swiss francs
used for the payment of the annual dividend.
As described above in the commentary on the net debt position, in 2009 the Group entered into derivative contracts with
third parties to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from bonds and notes issued in currencies other than US dollar.
At the same time collateral agreements were entered into with the derivative counterparties to mitigate counterparty risk.
For short-term financing requirements, the Group has a commercial paper programme in the United States under which
it can issue up to 7.5 billion US dollars of unsecured commercial paper notes and a committed credit line of 3.9 billion euros
available as back-stop line. Commercial paper notes totalling 1.1 billion US dollars were outstanding as of 31 December
2011. For longer-term financing the Group maintains strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA– by Standard
& Poor’s and A1 by Moody’s, upgraded from A2 in September 2011. These should facilitate efficient access to international
capital markets.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2011Financial risks
As at 31 December 2011 the Group has a net debt position of 16 billion Swiss francs (31 December 2010: 19 billion Swiss
francs). The financial assets of the Group are managed in a conservative way with the objective to meet the Group’s financial
obligations at all times.
Asset allocation. A considerable portion of the cash and marketable securities the Group currently holds is being used
for debt redemptions. Liquid funds are either held as cash or are invested in high-quality, investment-grade fixed income
securities with an investment horizon to meet those liquidity requirements.

Credit risk. Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations causing
financial losses for the Group. The rating profile of the Group’s 11.0 billion Swiss francs fixed income marketable securities
remained strong with more than 99% being invested in the A–AAA range. As noted previously the Group has signed netting
and collateral agreements with the counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty risk on derivative positions.
The Group has trade receivables of 10.3 billion Swiss francs. Since the beginning of 2010 there have been increasing
financial difficulties in certain Southern European countries, including Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece. The Group is a
leading supplier in these countries and has trade receivables of 2.1 billion Swiss francs with the public customers in these
countries. The Group uses different measures to improve collections in these countries, including intense communication
with customers, negotiations of payment plans, charging of interest for late payments, and legal action. The Group is also
applying delivery against cash to some public hospitals in Greece.
In the second half of 2010 the Group accepted an offer made by the Greek government to settle 0.4 billion euros of trade
receivables with zero coupon government bonds, redeemable between 2011 and 2013. The Group has sold the vast majority
of the bonds during 2011. The remaining bonds have a carrying value of 5 million Swiss francs. The accounts receivables
in scope of the bond settlement had already been provided for at 31 December 2010 to reflect the bond settlement terms
when those had become available. The settlement terms implied a discount of 114 million euros, an average discount of 26%,
included in the 2009 and 2010 results. During 2011 the total financial result on the trade receivables and zero coupon bonds
in scope of the settlement was an expense of 2 million Swiss francs. This includes interest income, gains and losses on sale
of bonds, and impairments of the remaining positions to market value at 31 December 2011.
liquidity risk. Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point
in time. The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity
requirements at any point in time. In addition to the current liquidity position the Group has strong cash generation ability.
Those future cash flows will be used to repay debt instruments in the coming years.
Despite total debt of 26.9 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2011, Roche enjoys strong long-term investment-grade credit
ratings of AA– by Standard & Poor’s and A1 by Moody’s. At the same time Roche is rated at the highest available short-term
ratings by those agencies. In the event of financing requirements, the ratings and the strong credit of Roche should permit
efficient access to international capital markets, including the commercial paper market. The Group has committed credit
lines with various financial institutions totalling 5.2 billion Swiss francs (31 December 2010: 4.5 billion Swiss francs) of which
4.8 billion Swiss francs serve as back-stop line for the commercial paper programme. As at 31 December 2011 no debt has
been drawn under these credit lines.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewMarket risks. Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities. The
exposures are predominantly related to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The Group uses
Value-at-Risk (VaR) to assess the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. VaR data indicates the value range within
which a given financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices. The VaR
data in the table below indicates the economic loss level over a period of one month which with 95% probability will not be
exceeded. Actual future economic gains and losses associated with our treasury activities may differ materially from the VaR
analyses performed due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes to interest
rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and equity investment prices, particularly in periods of high market volatilities.
Furthermore, the VaR numbers below do not include a credit risk component.
Market risk of financial instruments
31 December 2011 31 December 2010
(mCHF) (mCHF)
VaR – Interest rate component 301 466
VaR – Foreign exchange component 49 44
VaR – Other price component 35 34
Diversification (69) (77)
VaR – Total 316 467
The interest rate VaR decreased reflecting the ageing of debt and the repayment of debt during 2011. As all issued debt
is held at amortised cost, the interest rate VaR is a sole metric for economic fair value changes, but there is no impact on
the carrying value or profit and loss of the Group. The foreign exchange VaR increased slightly due to lower diversification
effects. Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities and remained largely stable. At
31 December 2011 the Group held equity securities with a market value of 0.4 billion Swiss francs (31 December 2010:
0.5 billion Swiss francs). This includes holdings in biotechnology companies which were acquired in the context of licensing
transactions or scientific collaborations.
Further information on financial risk management and financial risks and the VaR methodology is included in Note 31 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
International Financial Reporting Standards
The Roche Group has been using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to report its consolidated results since
1990. In 2011 the Group has implemented various other amendments to existing standards and interpretations, which have
no material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position. During 2011 various new standards were issued,
as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which should be implemented at the latest by 2013. Except
as noted below, based on the initial analysis to date, the Group does not anticipate that these will have a material impact on
the Group’s overall results and financial position.
Amongst other matters the revised version of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ includes the following changes to the existing
standard:
Eliminating the option to defer the recognition of actuarial gains and losses from defined benefit post-employment plans,
known as the ‘corridor method’. The Group does not currently apply this option, but rather uses the option to recognise
such gains and losses directly in equity. The option currently applied by the Group will henceforth be a requirement under
the revised standard and therefore this change will have no impact on the Group’s financial statements.
The current method of including the expected income from plan assets at an estimated asset return would be replaced by
using the discount rate that is used to discount the defined benefit obligation. Based on an initial review the Group estimates
that, had this method been applied to the 2011 consolidated financial statements, net financial income would have been
approximately 130 million Swiss francs lower than that published. Operating profit would not have been materially affected.

Roche Group – Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011Notes to the Roche Group
Consolidated Financial Statements
Reference numbers indicate corresponding Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of the Roche Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. They have been prepared using the historical cost convention except
that, as disclosed in the accounting policies below, certain items, including derivatives and available-for-sale investments, are
shown at fair value. They were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 24 January 2012 and are subject to approval
by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on 6 March 2012.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at
the date of the financial statements. If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s
best judgement at the date of the financial statements, deviate from the actual circumstances, the original estimates and
assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the year in which the circumstances change.
Changes in accounting policies that arise from the application of new or revised standards and interpretations are applied
retrospectively, unless otherwise specified in the transitional requirements of the particular standard or interpretation.
Retrospective application requires that the results of the comparative period and the opening balances of that period
are restated as if the new accounting policy had always been applied. In some cases the transitional requirements of the
particular standard or interpretation specify that the changes are to be applied prospectively. Prospective application
requires that the new accounting policy only be applied to the results of the current period and the comparative period
is not restated. In addition comparatives have been reclassified or extended from the previously reported results to take
into account any presentational changes.
Consolidation policy
These financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, a company registered in
Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’).
The subsidiaries are those companies controlled, directly or indirectly, by Roche Holding Ltd, where control is defined as the
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. This control
is normally evidenced when Roche Holding Ltd owns, either directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or
currently exercisable potential voting rights of a company’s share capital. Special Purpose Entities are consolidated where the
substance of the relationship is that the Special Purpose Entity is controlled by the Group. Companies acquired during the
year are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group, and subsidiaries to be divested are included
up to the date on which control passes from the Group. Inter-company balances, transactions and resulting unrealised
income are eliminated in full. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they
occur after control has already been obtained and if they do not result in a loss of control.
48
Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsInvestments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. These are companies over which the Group exercises,
or has the power to exercise, significant influence, but which it does not control. This is normally evidenced when the Group
owns 20% or more of the voting rights or currently exercisable potential voting rights of the company. Balances and
transactions with associates that result in unrealised income are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the
associate. Interests in joint ventures are reported using the line-by-line proportionate consolidation method.
Segment reporting
For the purpose of segment reporting the Group’s Corporate Executive Committee (CEC) is considered to be the Group’s Chief
Operating Decision Maker. The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the organisation units for which
information is reported to the CEC on a regular basis. The information provided is used as the basis of the segment revenue
and profit disclosures reported in Note 2, with the geographic analysis based on the location of customers. Selected segment
balance sheet information is also routinely provided to the CEC. The Group has two divisions, Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics.
Revenues are primarily generated from the sale of prescription pharmaceutical products and diagnostic instruments, reagents
and consumables, respectively. Both divisions also derive revenues from the sale or licensing of products or technology to third
parties. Residual operating activities from divested businesses and certain global activities are reported as ‘Corporate’. These
include the CEC and global group functions for communications, human resources and finance, including treasury, taxes and
pension fund management. Also included are corporate legal and corporate safety and environmental services. Sub-divisional
information for Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai, operating segments within the Pharmaceuticals Division, is also presented.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis. Operating assets and liabilities consist of
property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade receivables/payables, inventories and other assets and
liabilities, such as provisions, which can be reasonably attributed to the reported operating segments. Non-operating assets
and liabilities mainly include current and deferred income tax balances, post-employment benefit assets/liabilities and financial
assets/liabilities such as cash, marketable securities, investments and debt.
Foreign currency translation
Most Group companies use their local currency as their functional currency. Certain Group companies use other currencies
(such as US dollars, Swiss francs or euros) as their functional currency where this is the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates. Local transactions in other currencies are initially reported using the exchange rate
at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses from the settlement of such transactions and gains and losses on translation
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are included in income, except when they are qualifying
cash flow hedges or arise on monetary items that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign entity.
In such cases the gains and losses are deferred into other comprehensive income.
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using functional currencies other than Swiss francs (foreign
entities) are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange. Sales, costs, expenses, net income and cash
flows are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Translation differences due to the changes in exchange
rates between the beginning and the end of the year and the difference between net income translated at the average and
year-end exchange rates are taken directly to other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign entity, the identified
cumulative currency translation differences within other comprehensive income relating to that foreign entity are recognised
in income as part of the gain or loss on divestment.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011Revenues
Sales represent amounts received and receivable for goods supplied to customers after deducting trade discounts, cash
discounts and volume rebates, and exclude value added taxes and other taxes directly linked to sales. Revenues from the sale
of products are recognised upon transfer to the customer of significant risks and rewards. Trade discounts, cash discounts
and volume rebates are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of the related sales. Estimates of
expected sales returns, charge-backs and other rebates, including Medicaid in the United States and similar rebates in other
countries, are also deducted from sales and recorded as accrued liabilities or provisions or as a deduction from accounts
receivable. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual or legislatively mandated obligations, historical
trends and the Group’s experience. If the circumstances are such that the level of sales returns, and hence revenues, cannot
be reliably measured, then sales are only recognised when the right of return expires, which is generally upon prescription
of the products to patients. Other revenues are recorded as earned or as the services are performed. Where necessary,
single transactions are split into separately identifiable components to reflect the substance of the transaction. Conversely,
two or more transactions may be considered together for revenue recognition purposes, where the commercial effect
cannot be understood without reference to the series of transactions as a whole.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and related production overheads of goods sold and
services rendered. Royalties, alliance and collaboration expenses, including all collaboration profit-sharing arrangements are
also reported as part of cost of sales. Start-up costs between validation and the achievement of normal production capacity
are expensed as incurred.
Research and development
Internal research costs are those costs incurred for the purpose of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and
understanding. These costs are expensed as incurred.
Internal development costs are those costs incurred for the application of research findings or other knowledge to plan
and develop new products for commercial production. Such costs would qualify for capitalisation as intangible assets only
if all of the following criteria can be demonstrated:
The technical feasibility of completing the development project successfully so that it will be available for use or sale.
The intention to complete the development project.
The ability to use or sell the results of the development project.
That the development project would generate economic benefits. This would normally be evidenced by the existence and
size of a market for the results of the project itself or the products that would result from the project.
The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development project.
The ability to measure the development expenditure reliably that would qualify for capitalisation as an intangible asset.
The development projects undertaken by the Group are subject to technical, regulatory and other uncertainties, such that,
in the opinion of management, the criteria for capitalisation are not met prior to obtaining marketing approval by the regulatory
authorities in major markets. Internal development costs that do not meet these criteria are therefore expensed as incurred.
Post-marketing studies after regulatory approval, such as phase IV costs in the pharmaceuticals business, are expensed
as incurred. They generally involve safety surveillance and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives marketing
approval to be sold. They may be required by regulatory authorities or may be undertaken for safety or commercial reasons.
The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare or long-term adverse effects over a much larger patient population and
longer time period than was possible during earlier stages of development. The costs of such post-marketing studies are not
capitalised as intangible assets, as in the opinion of management, they do not generate separately identifiable incremental
future economic benefits that can be reliably measured.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsIn addition to its internal research and development activities, the Group is also party to in-licensing and similar arrangements
with its alliance partners. The Group may also acquire in-process research and development assets, either through business
combinations or through purchases of specific assets.
In-process research and development resources acquired either through in-licensing arrangements, business combinations
or separate purchases are capitalised as intangible assets if they are controlled by the Group, are separately identifiable
and are expected to generate future economic benefits, even if uncertainty exists as to whether the research and
development will ultimately result in a marketable product. Consequently, upfront and milestone payments to third parties
for pharmaceutical products or compounds before regulatory marketing approval are recognised as intangible assets.
Assets acquired through such arrangements are measured on the basis set out below in the ‘Intangible assets’ policy and
are reviewed for impairment as set out below in the ‘Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets’
policy. Subsequent internal research and development costs incurred post-acquisition are treated in the same way as other
internal research and development costs. Once available for use, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over
the period of the expected benefit and are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date. If research and development are
embedded in contracts for strategic alliances, the Group carefully assess whether upfront or milestone payments constitute
funding of research and development work or acquisition of an asset.
licensing, milestone and other upfront receipts
Royalty income is recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the respective licensing agreements.
If the collectability of a royalty amount is not reasonably assured, those royalties are recognised as revenue when the cash is
received. Certain Group companies receive upfront, milestone and other similar payments from third parties relating to
the sale or licensing of products or technology. Revenue associated with performance milestones is recognised based on
achievement of the deliverables as defined in the respective agreements. Upfront payments and licence fees for which
there are subsequent deliverables are initially reported as deferred income and are recognised in income as earned over
the period of the development collaboration or the manufacturing obligation.
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits are
accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group. Where the Group provides
long-term employee benefits, the cost is accrued to match the rendering of the services by the employees concerned.
Liabilities for long-term employee benefits are discounted to take into account the time value of money, where material.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Most employees are covered by defined benefit and defined contribution post-employment plans sponsored by Group
companies. The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the appropriate income statement heading
within the operating results in the year to which they relate. The accounting and reporting of defined benefit plans are based
on recent actuarial valuations. The defined benefit obligations and service costs are calculated using the projected unit credit
method. This reflects service rendered by employees to the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily
regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth and long-
term expected rates of return for plan assets. Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds
in the country concerned. Past service costs are allocated over the average period until the benefits become vested. Current
and past service costs are charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results. Pension plan
administration and funding is overseen at a corporate level and any settlement gains and losses resulting from changes in
funding arrangements are reported as general and administration expenses within the ‘Corporate’ segment. The expected
returns on plan assets and interest costs are charged to financial income and financing costs, respectively. Actuarial gains
and losses, which consist of differences between assumptions and actual experiences and the effects of changes in actuarial
assumptions, are recorded directly in other comprehensive income. Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit
plans are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in
the other plan. The recognition of pension assets is limited to the total of the present value of any future refunds from the plans
or reductions in future contributions to the plans and any cumulative unrecognised past service costs. Adjustments arising
from the limit on the recognition of assets for defined benefit plans are recorded directly in other comprehensive income.
51
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011Equity compensation plans
Certain employees of the Group participate in equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Genentech (prior
to the Genentech transaction) and at Chugai. The fair value of all equity compensation awards granted to employees is
estimated at the grant date and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. The expense is charged to the appropriate
income statement heading within the operating results. For equity-settled plans, an increase in equity is recorded for this
expense and any subsequent cash flows from exercises of vested awards are recorded as changes in equity. For cash-
settled plans, a liability is recorded, which is measured at fair value at each reporting date with any movements in fair value
being recorded to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results. Any subsequent cash flows from
exercise of vested awards are recorded as a reduction of the liability.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction, and include all costs directly
attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner
intended by management. These include items such as costs of site preparation, installation and assembly costs and
professional fees. The net costs of testing whether the asset is functioning properly, including validation costs, are also
included in the initially recorded cost of construction. Interest and other borrowing costs incurred with respect to qualifying
assets are capitalised and included in the carrying value of the assets.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis, except for land, which is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives of major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
Land improvements 40 years
Buildings 10–50 years
Machinery and equipment 4–15 years
Diagnostic instruments 3–5 years
Office equipment 3–6 years
Motor vehicles 5–8 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate
components. The estimated useful lives of the assets are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation
charges are accelerated. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
leases
Where the Group is the lessee, leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all of the risks
and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the start of the lease at fair value,
or the present value of the minimum lease payments, if lower. The rental obligation, net of finance charges, is reported within
debt. Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated in accordance with the Group’s policy on property, plant and
equipment. If there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its useful life. The interest element of the lease payment is charged against
income over the lease term based on the effective interest rate method. Leases where substantially all of the risks and
rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating
leases are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where the Group is the lessor, which primarily occurs in the Diagnostics Division, assets subject to finance leases are
initially reported as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Assets subject to operating leases
are reported within property, plant and equipment. Lease income from finance leases is subsequently recognised as earned
income over the term of the lease based on the effective interest rate method. Lease income from operating leases is
recognised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
52
Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsBusiness combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The consideration transferred in a
business combination is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. This consideration includes the cash paid plus the
fair value at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group.
The fair value of the consideration transferred also includes contingent consideration arrangements at fair value. Directly
attributable acquisition-related costs are expensed in the current period and reported within general and administration
expenses. At the date of acquisition the Group recognises the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any
non-controlling interest in the acquired business. The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are initially
recognised at fair value. Where the Group does not acquire 100% ownership of the acquired business, non-controlling
interests are recorded as the proportion of the fair value of the acquired net assets attributable to the non-controlling
interest. Goodwill is recorded as the surplus of the consideration transferred over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the
acquired net assets. Any goodwill and fair value adjustments are recorded as assets and liabilities of the acquired business in
the functional currency of that business. When the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete at the end of a
reporting period, provisional amounts are used. During the measurement period, the provisional amounts are retrospectively
adjusted and additional assets and liabilities may be recognised, to reflect new information obtained about the facts and
circumstances that existed at the acquisition date which would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognised
at that date, had they been known. The measurement period does not exceed twelve months from the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is assessed for possible impairment at each reporting date and is additionally tested annually
for impairment. Goodwill may also arise upon investments in associates, being the surplus of the cost of investment over
the Group’s share of the fair value of the net identifiable assets. Such goodwill is recorded within investments in associates.
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has
already been obtained and if they do not result in a loss of control.
Intangible assets
Purchased patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Where these assets have
been acquired through a business combination, this will be the fair value allocated in the acquisition accounting. Intangible
assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis beginning from the point when they are available for
use. The estimated useful life is the lower of the legal duration and the economic useful life. The estimated useful lives of
intangible assets are regularly reviewed.
Estimated useful lives of major classes of amortisable intangible assets are as follows:
Product intangibles in use 4–20 years
Marketing intangibles in use 2–5 years
Technology intangibles in use 7–14 years
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
An impairment assessment is carried out when there is evidence that an asset may be impaired. In addition intangible
assets that are not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. When the recoverable amount of an asset, being
the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value is
reduced to its recoverable amount. This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. Value in use
is calculated using estimated cash flows, generally over a five-year period, with extrapolating projections for subsequent
years. These are discounted using an appropriate long-term pre-tax interest rate. When an impairment loss arises, the
useful life of the asset in question is reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation/amortisation charge is accelerated.
The impairment of financial assets is discussed below in the ‘Financial assets’ policy.
53
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is assessed for possible impairment at each reporting date and is additionally tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units as described in Note 12. When the recoverable amount of the cash-generating
unit, being the higher of its fair value less costs to sell or its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying
value of the goodwill is reduced to its recoverable amount. This reduction is reported in the income statement as an
impairment loss. The methodology used in the impairment testing is further described in Note 12.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods and work in process includes
raw materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs and overheads based upon the normal capacity of
production facilities. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling
price less cost to completion and selling expenses.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts, trade discounts,
cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for the difference
between the carrying value and the estimated recoverable amount where there is objective evidence that the Group will
not be able to collect all amounts due. These estimates are based on specific indicators, such as the ageing of customer
balances, specific credit circumstances and the Group’s historical experience, taking also into account economic conditions.
Expenses for doubtful trade receivables are recognised in the consolidated income statement within marketing and
distribution expenses. Trade discounts, cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances are recorded on an accrual
basis consistent with the recognition of the related sales, using estimates based on existing contractual obligations, historical
trends and the Group’s experience. Long-term accounts receivable are discounted to take into account the time value of
money, where material.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and time, call and current balances with banks and similar institutions. Such
balances are only reported as cash if they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk
of changes in value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. This definition is also used for
the statement of cash flows.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to an outflow
of resources that can be reasonably estimated. In particular, restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has
a detailed formal plan that has either commenced implementation or has been announced. Provisions are recorded for the
estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise, taking into account foreign currency effects arising from their translation
from their functional currency into Swiss francs and the time value of money, where material. A contingent liability is
disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation
cannot be measured with reasonable reliability. Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of
economic benefits is probable.
Fair values
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable
and willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices or by the use of
established valuation techniques such as option pricing models and the discounted cash flow method if quoted prices in an
active market are not available (‘fair value hierarchy’). Valuation techniques will incorporate observable market data about
market conditions and other factors that are likely to affect the fair value of a financial instrument. Valuation techniques are
typically used for derivative financial instruments. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities at the reporting date are
not materially different from their reported carrying values unless specifically mentioned in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Information on fair value hierarchy is included in Note 31 on risk management.
54
Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsFinancial assets
Financial assets, principally investments, including marketable securities, are classified as either ‘Fair-value-through-profit-
or-loss’, ‘Available-for-sale’, ‘Held-to-maturity’ or ‘Loans and receivables’. Fair-value-through-profit-or-loss financial assets
are either classified as held-for-trading or designated upon initial recognition. Held-for-trading financial assets are acquired
principally to generate profit from short-term fluctuations in price. Financial assets are designated as fair-value-through-
profit-or-loss if doing so results in more relevant information by eliminating a measurement or recognition inconsistency.
Held-to-maturity financial assets are securities with a fixed maturity that the Group has the intent and ability to hold until
maturity. Loans and receivables are financial assets created by the Group or acquired from the issuer in a primary market.
They are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
All other financial assets are considered to be available-for-sale.
All financial assets are initially recorded at fair value, including transaction costs, except for assets at fair-value-through-
profit-or-loss, which exclude transaction costs. All purchases and sales are recognised on the settlement date. Fair-value-
through-profit-or-loss financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value, with all changes in fair value recorded as
financial income in the period in which they arise. Held-to-maturity financial assets are subsequently carried at amortised
cost using the effective interest rate method. Available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value, with all
unrealised changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income except for interest calculated using the effective
interest rate method and foreign exchange components. When the available-for-sale financial assets are sold, impaired or
otherwise disposed of, the cumulative gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in
financial income for the current period. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method.
Financial assets are individually assessed for possible impairment at each reporting date. An impairment charge is recorded
where there is objective evidence of impairment, such as where the issuer is in bankruptcy, default or other significant
financial difficulty. In addition any available-for-sale equity securities that have a market value of more than 25% below their
original cost, net of any previous impairment, will be considered as impaired. Any available-for-sale equity securities that
have a market value below their original cost, net of any previous impairment, for a sustained six-month period will also be
considered as impaired. Any decreases in the market price of less than 25% of original cost, net of any previous impairment,
which are also for less than a sustained six-month period are not by themselves considered as objective evidence of
impairment. Such movements in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income until there is objective evidence of
impairment or until the asset is sold or otherwise disposed of. For financial assets carried at amortised cost, any impairment
charge is the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount, calculated using estimated future cash
flows discounted using the original effective interest rate. For available-for-sale financial assets, any impairment charge is
the amount currently carried in other comprehensive income for the difference between the original cost, net of any previous
impairment, and the fair value. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring
after the impairment loss was recognised. For debt securities measured at amortised cost or available-for-sale, the reversal is
recognised in income. For equity securities held available-for-sale, the reversal is recognised directly in other comprehensive
income.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual cash flows from the asset expire or when the Group transfers the
rights to receive the contractual cash flows from the financial assets in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or
retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
Derivatives
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Apart from those derivatives
designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments as discussed in the ‘Hedge accounting’ policy below, all changes in
fair value are recorded as financial income in the period in which they arise. Embedded derivatives are recognised separately
if not closely related to the host contract and where the host contract is carried at amortised cost.
55
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011Hedge accounting
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types. A ‘fair value hedge’ is a hedge of the
exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or an unrecognised firm commitment, or an identified
portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss.
A ‘cash flow hedge’ is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss. A ‘hedge of a net
investment in a foreign operation’ is a hedge of the foreign currency exposure on a net investment in a foreign operation.
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability
of occurrence (for cash flow hedges), hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. If these conditions are not met,
then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are
reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship. In particular any derivatives are reported at fair value,
with changes in fair value included in financial income.
For qualifying fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item is recorded at its
previous carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair value that are attributable to the hedged risk. Any changes in the fair
values are reported in financial income.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of any change in fair value
that is an effective hedge is included in other comprehensive income, and any remaining ineffective portion is reported in
financial income. If the hedging relationship is the hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment or highly probable
forecasted transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the cumulative changes in the fair
value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying
value of the asset or liability at the date of recognition. For all other qualifying cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes
in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive income are included in financial
income when the forecasted transaction affects net income.
For qualifying hedges of net investment in a foreign entity, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of
any change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in other comprehensive income. Any remaining ineffective
portion is recorded in financial income where the hedging instrument is a derivative and in other comprehensive income in
other cases. If the entity is disposed of, then the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been
recorded in other comprehensive income are reclassified to income.
Debt
Debt instruments are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Subsequently they
are reported at amortised cost. Any discount between the net proceeds received and the principal value due on redemption
is amortised over the duration of the debt instrument and is recognised as part of financing costs using the effective interest
rate method. The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or
expired.
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding taxes payable on the
distribution of retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based on income, such as property and capital taxes,
are included within general and administration expenses.
Liabilities for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally
relating to subsidiaries, are only recognised where it is probable that such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future.
56
Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements. Deferred income tax assets relating to the carry-forward
of unused tax losses are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which
the unused tax losses can be utilised.
Current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the same taxation
authority and when there is a legally enforceable right to offset them. Deferred income taxes are determined based on
the currently enacted tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction where the Group operates.
Discontinued businesses and non-current assets-held-for-sale
A discontinued business is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or
geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Reclassification as a discontinued
business occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale, if earlier.
A disposal group is a group of assets that are to be disposed of as a group in a single transaction, together with the liabilities
directly associated with those assets that will be transferred in the transaction. The assets and liabilities in a disposal group
are reclassified as held-for-sale if their value will be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use.
The disposal group must be available for sale in its current condition and the sale must be highly probable.
Immediately before classification as held-for-sale, the measurement of all assets and liabilities in a disposal group is updated in
accordance with applicable accounting policies. Then, on initial classification as held for sale, disposal groups are recognised
at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale are
included in the income statement.
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The original purchase cost,
consideration received for subsequent resale of these equity instruments and other movements are reported as changes
in equity. These instruments have been acquired primarily to meet the potential obligations to employees that may arise
in respect of certain of the Group’s equity compensation plans.
Management judgements made in applying accounting policies
The application of the Group’s accounting policies may require management to make judgements, apart from those
involving estimates, that can have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
Management judgement is particularly required when assessing the substance of transactions that have a complicated
structure or legal form. These include, but are not limited to, the following areas:
Revenue recognition. The nature of the Group’s business is such that many sales transactions do not have a simple
structure. Sales agreements may consist of multiple components occurring at different times. The Group is also party
to various out-licensing agreements, which can involve upfront and milestone payments that may occur over several
years. These agreements may also involve certain future obligations. Revenue is only recognised when, in management’s
judgement, the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred and when the Group does not retain
continuing managerial involvement or effective control over the goods sold or when the obligation has been fulfilled. For
some transactions this can result in cash receipts being initially recognised as deferred income and then released to income
over subsequent periods on the basis of the performance of the conditions specified in the agreement.
Consolidation of subsidiaries and associates. The Group periodically undertakes transactions that may involve obtaining
the right to control or significantly influence the operations of other companies. These transactions include the acquisition of
all or part of the equity of other companies, the purchase of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities and contingent
liabilities of other companies, and entering into alliance agreements with other companies. Also included are transactions
involving Special Purpose Entities and similar vehicles. In all such cases management makes an assessment as to whether
the Group has the right to control or significantly influence the other company’s operations, and based on this assessment
the other company is consolidated as a subsidiary or associated company. In making this assessment management considers
the underlying economic substance of the transaction and not only the contractual terms.
57
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011Business combinations. Where the Group acquires control of another business, the consideration transferred has to be
allocated to the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired business,
with any residual recorded as goodwill. This process involves management making an assessment of the fair value of these
items. Management judgement is particularly involved in the recognition and measurement of the following items:
Intellectual property. This may include patents, licences, trademarks and similar rights for currently marketed products, and
also the rights and scientific knowledge associated with projects that are currently in research or development phases.
Contingencies such as legal and environmental matters.
Contingent consideration arrangements.
The recoverability of any accumulated tax losses previously incurred by the acquired company.
In all cases management makes an assessment based on the underlying economic substance of the items concerned,
and not only on the contractual terms, in order to fairly present these items.
leases. The Group is party to leasing arrangements, both as a lessee and as a lessor. The treatment of leasing transactions
in the financial statements is mainly determined by whether the lease is considered to be an operating lease or a finance
lease. In making this assessment, management looks at the substance of the lease, as well as the legal form, and makes a
judgement about whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Arrangements which do not
take the legal form of a lease but that nevertheless convey the right to use an asset are also covered by such assessments.
Key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and
related disclosures. The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgements
about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in accounting estimates may be
necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based, or as a result of new information or
more experience. Such changes are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.
The key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing
a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next twelve months are described below.
Revenue recognition. There may be circumstances such that the level of sales returns, and hence revenues, cannot
be reliably measured. In such cases sales are only recognised when the right of return expires, which is generally upon
prescription of the products to patients. In order to estimate this, management uses publicly available information about
prescriptions as well as information provided by wholesalers and other intermediaries.
Sales allowances. The Group has provisions and accruals for expected sales returns, charge-backs and other rebates,
including Medicaid in the United States and similar rebates in other countries, which at 31 December 2011 total 1,497 million
Swiss francs. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual or legislatively-mandated obligations, historical
trends and the Group’s experience. Management believes that the total provisions and accruals for these items are adequate,
based upon currently available information. As these deductions are based on management estimates, they may be subject
to change as better information becomes available. Such changes that arise could impact the provisions and accruals
recognised in the balance sheet in future periods and consequently the level of sales recognised in the income statement in
future periods.
58
Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsAllowances for doubtful accounts receivable. The Group has provisions and accruals for doubtful receivables, which at
31 December 2011 total 431 million Swiss francs (see Note 17). Such estimates are based on analyses of ageing of customer
balances, specific credit circumstances, historical trends and the Group’s experience, taking also into account economic
conditions. Management believes that the total provisions and accruals for these items are adequate, based upon currently
available information. As these provisions are based on management estimates, they may be subject to change as better
information becomes available. Such changes that arise could impact the provisions and accruals recognised in the balance
sheet in future periods and consequently the marketing and distribution expenses recognised in the income statement in
future periods.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill. The Group has property, plant and equipment
with a carrying value of 16,201 million Swiss francs as disclosed in Note 11. Goodwill has a carrying value of 7,843 million
Swiss francs (see Note 12) and intangible assets have a carrying value of 5,126 million Swiss francs (see Note 13). All of
these assets are reviewed annually for impairment as described above. To assess whether any impairment exists, estimates
are made of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal. Actual outcomes
could vary significantly from such estimates of discounted future cash flows. Factors such as changes in the planned use of
buildings, machinery or equipment, or closure of facilities, the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence
or lower than anticipated sales of products with capitalised rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
Changes in the discount rates used could also lead to impairments.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits. Many of the Group’s employees participate in post-employment defined
benefit plans. The calculations of the recognised assets and liabilities from such plans are based upon statistical and actuarial
calculations. In particular the present value of the defined benefit obligation is impacted by assumptions on discount rates
used to arrive at the present value of future pension liabilities, and assumptions on future increases in salaries and benefits.
Furthermore, the Group’s independent actuaries use statistically based assumptions covering areas such as future withdrawals
of participants from the plan and estimates of life expectancy. At 31 December 2011 the present value of the Group’s defined
benefit obligation is 12,428 million Swiss francs for funded plans and 3,249 million Swiss francs for unfunded plans (see Note
9). The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changes in market and economic conditions,
higher or lower withdrawal rates, longer or shorter life spans of participants, and other changes in the factors being assessed.
These differences could impact the assets or liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
legal provisions. Group companies are party to various legal proceedings, including claims arising from trade, and the
most significant matters are described in Note 24. Legal provisions at 31 December 2011 total 746 million Swiss francs.
Management believes that the total provisions for legal proceedings are adequate based upon currently available information.
However, given the inherent difficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, it cannot be guaranteed that additional costs
will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued. Additional claims could be made which might not be covered by existing
provisions or by insurance. There can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in the scope of these matters or
that any future lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations will not be material. Such changes that arise could impact the
provisions recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Environmental provisions. The Group has provisions for environmental remediation costs, which at 31 December 2011
total 265 million Swiss francs, as disclosed in Note 24. The material components of the environmental provisions consist of
costs to fully clean and refurbish contaminated sites, including landfills, and to treat and contain contamination at certain
other sites. Future remediation expenses are affected by a number of uncertainties that include, but are not limited to,
the detection of previously unknown contaminated sites, the method and extent of remediation, the percentage of the
problematic materials attributable to the Group at the remediation sites relative to that attributable to other parties, and
the financial capabilities of the other potentially responsible parties. Management believes that the total provisions for
environmental matters are adequate based upon currently available information. However, given the inherent difficulties
in estimating liabilities in this area, it cannot be guaranteed that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts
accrued. The effect of the resolution of environmental matters on the results of operations cannot be predicted due to
uncertainty concerning both the amount and the timing of future expenditures. Such changes that arise could impact the
provisions recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011Income taxes. At 31 December 2011 the net liability for current income taxes is 1,984 million Swiss francs and the net
asset for deferred income taxes is 2,158 million Swiss francs, as disclosed in Note 5. Significant estimates are required
to determine the current and deferred assets and liabilities for income taxes. Some of these estimates are based on
interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Management believes that the estimates are reasonable and that the
recognised liabilities for income tax-related uncertainties are adequate. Various internal and external factors may have
favourable or unfavourable effects on the income tax assets and liabilities. These factors include, but are not limited to,
changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, future levels
of research and development spending and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. Such changes that arise could
impact the assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Changes in accounting policies
Changes in IFRS implemented in 2011. The Group has implemented various minor amendments to existing standards
and interpretations, which have no material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position.
New and revised standards. During 2011 the following new standards were issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB), which should be implemented at the latest by 2013:
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’.
IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’.
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’.
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’.
IAS 19 (revised) ‘Employee Benefits’.
In addition further revisions were issued to IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’. The implementation date of this standard has now
been deferred to 2015 at the latest.
The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of these and other new and revised standards and interpretations that
will be effective from 1 January 2012 and beyond, and which the Group has not early adopted. Except as noted below, based
on the analysis to date, the Group does not anticipate that these will have a material impact on the Group’s overall results and
financial position.
Amongst other matters the revised version of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ includes the following changes to the existing
standard:
Eliminating the option to defer the recognition of actuarial gains and losses from defined benefit post-employment plans,
known as the ‘corridor method’. The Group does not currently apply this option, but rather uses the option to recognise
such gains and losses directly in other comprehensive income. The option currently applied by the Group will henceforth
be a requirement under the revised standard and therefore this change will have no impact on the Group’s financial
statements.
The current method of including the expected income from plan assets at an estimated asset return would be replaced
by using the discount rate that is used to discount the defined benefit obligation. Based on an initial review the Group
estimates that, had this method been applied to the 2011 consolidated financial statements, net financial income would
have been approximately 130 million Swiss francs lower than that published. Operating profit would not have been
materially affected.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011Supplementary unaudited information on sales by therapeutic areas in the Pharmaceuticals Division and by business areas in
the Diagnostics Division are given in the Financial Review. Sales are allocated to geographical areas by destination according
to the location of the customer. Royalties and other operating income are allocated according to the location of the Group
company that receives the revenue. European Union information is based on members of the EU as at 31 December 2011.
Major customers
The US national wholesale distributor, AmerisourceBergen Corp., represented approximately 5 billion Swiss francs
(2010: 6 billion Swiss francs) of the Group’s revenues. Approximately 99% of these revenues were in the Pharmaceuticals
operating segment, with the residual in the Diagnostics segment. The Group also reported substantial revenues from the US
national wholesale distributors, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corp., and in total these three customers represented
approximately a quarter of the Group’s revenues.
3. Chugai
Effective 1 October 2002 the Roche Group and Chugai completed an alliance to create a leading research-driven Japanese
pharmaceutical company, which was formed by the merger of Chugai and Roche’s Japanese pharmaceuticals subsidiary,
Nippon Roche. The merged company, known as Chugai, is a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group. At 31 December 2011
the Group’s interest in Chugai was 61.6% (2010: 61.6%).
The common stock of Chugai is publicly traded and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the stock code ‘TSE:4519’.
Chugai prepares financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (JGAAP).
These are filed on a quarterly basis with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to certain consolidation entries and differences in
the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and JGAAP, there are differences between Chugai’s
stand-alone results on a JGAAP basis and the results of Chugai as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with
IFRS.
Roche’s relationship with Chugai
Chugai has entered into certain agreements with Roche, which are discussed below:
Basic Alliance Agreement. As part of the Basic Alliance Agreement signed in December 2001, Roche and Chugai entered
into certain arrangements covering the future operation and governance of Chugai. Amongst other matters these cover
the following areas:
The structuring of the alliance.
Roche’s rights as a shareholder.
Roche’s rights to nominate members of Chugai’s Board of Directors.
Certain limitations to Roche’s ability to buy or sell Chugai’s common stock.
Chugai issues additional shares of common stock in connection with its convertible debt and equity compensation plans,
and may issue additional shares for other purposes, which affects Roche’s percentage ownership interest. The Basic
Alliance Agreement provides, amongst other matters, that Chugai will guarantee Roche’s right to maintain its shareholding
percentage in Chugai at not less than 50.1%.
licensing Agreements. Under the Japan Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in December 2001, Chugai has exclusive rights
to market Roche’s pharmaceutical products in Japan. Chugai also has right of first refusal on the development and marketing
in Japan of all development compounds advanced by Roche.
64
Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsUnder the Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in May 2002, Roche has the right of first refusal on the
development and marketing of Chugai’s development compounds in markets outside Japan, excluding South Korea, if Chugai
decides that it requires a partner for such activities.
Further to these agreements, Roche and Chugai have signed a series of separate agreements for certain specific products.
Depending on the specific circumstances and the terms of the agreement, this may result in payments on an arm’s length
basis between Roche and Chugai, for any or all of the following matters:
Upfront payments, if a right of first refusal to license a product is exercised.
Milestone payments, dependent upon the achievement of agreed performance targets.
Royalties on future product sales.
These specific product agreements may also cover the manufacture and supply of the respective products to meet the other
party’s clinical and/or commercial requirements on an arm’s length basis.
Research Collaboration Agreements. Roche and Chugai have entered into research collaboration agreements in the areas
of small-molecule synthetic drug research and biotechnology-based drug discovery.
Dividends
The dividends distributed to third parties holding Chugai shares during 2011 totalled 100 million Swiss francs
(2010: 99 million Swiss francs) and have been recorded against non-controlling interests (see Note 29). Dividends paid
by Chugai to Roche are eliminated on consolidation as inter-company items.
East Japan Earthquake
On 11 March 2011 a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the Pacific coast of Tohoku, Japan. The consequences on
Chugai’s operations in Japan were limited. The impacts of this disaster have been carefully reviewed regarding operations,
manufacturing processes and supply chain. Damage at Chugai’s Utsunomiya manufacturing plant resulted in operations
there being temporarily halted and production of all products at this plant was fully resumed by the end of August 2011. The
costs recorded in 2011 for the damage caused by the earthquake mainly relate to the Utsunomiya plant. These consisted of
impairments and restoration costs for buildings and partially damaged facilities, write-offs of some intermediates and finished
products and other costs during shutdown, net of amounts received from insurance. These costs were recorded as shown
below. Some of Chugai’s contract manufacturers were also affected by the earthquake and, as a result, product shipment
control lasted until the end of October 2011. Chugai’s promotional activities in Japan were affected, with events cancelled
and employee resources diverted to ensure continued product supply and information flow for customers. These factors
had a certain negative impact on Chugai’s sales in the second half of 2011.

Since the Group operates internationally, it is subject to income taxes in many different tax jurisdictions. The Group calculates
its average expected tax rate as a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
This rate changes from year to year due to changes in the mix of the Group’s taxable income and changes in local tax rates.
The average expected rate decreased in 2011 compared to 2010. The main driver of the decrease comes from Japan, which
has a relatively higher local tax rate than the average Group rate. The Group’s taxable profits in Japan decreased in 2011
which resulted in a decrease in the percentage Japan contributes to the overall mix of the Group’s profit. The lower profit
in Japan is mainly due to direct and indirect effects of the East Japan Earthquake on Chugai’s results as discussed in Note 3.
There were no significant local tax rate changes in the main operating areas of the Group compared to 2010, besides a
decrease of the statutory tax rate in Basel, Switzerland. The Group’s effective tax rate can be reconciled to the Group’s
average expected tax rate as follows:
Reconciliation of the Group’s effective tax rate
2011 2010
Average expected tax rate 19.6% 20.2%
Tax effect of
– Non-taxable income/non-deductible expenses +1.1% +0.9%
– Equity compensation plans –0.1% +0.7%
– Research, development and other manufacturing tax credits –2.1% –2.7%
– US state tax impacts +0.9% +1.4%
– Other differences +0.3% +0.2%
Group’s effective tax rate 19.7% 20.7%
The main contributors to the decrease in the Group’s effective tax rate compared to 2010 were the lower average expected
tax rate discussed above, increased equity compensation plan tax benefits and lower US state tax impacts. These items were
partially offset by an increase in non-deductible expenses as well as a lower research and development tax credit impact.
Non-deductible expenses in 2011 increased from 2010 mainly due to the newly introduced US Branded Pharmaceutical
Product Fee. The impact from equity compensation plans on the effective tax rate 2011 was a decrease of 0.1%, while in 2010
it was an increase of 0.7%. This is mainly due to the increase in the price of the underlying equity. Changes in US state tax
legislation resulted in a lower US state tax rate compared to 2010.
The income tax benefits recorded in respect of equity compensation plans, which varies according to the price of the
underlying equity, was 120 million Swiss francs (2010: 6 million Swiss francs). Had the income tax benefits been recorded
solely on the basis of the IFRS 2 expense multiplied by the applicable tax rate, then benefits of approximately 112 million
Swiss francs (2010: 89 million Swiss francs) would have been recorded.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsDeferred income tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward only to the extent that realisation of the related tax
benefit is probable. The Group has unrecognised tax losses, including valuation allowances, as follows:

The ‘More than five years’ category includes losses that cannot be used for US state income tax purposes in those states
which only permit tax reporting on a separate entity basis.
Deferred income tax liabilities have not been established for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on
the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, as such amounts are currently regarded as permanently reinvested. The total
unremitted earnings of the Group were 24.8 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2011 (2010: 26.5 billion Swiss francs).

consideration for PVT Probenverteiltechnik GmbH was 87 million euros of which 62 million euros were paid in cash and
25 million euros arose from a contingent consideration arrangement. The purchase consideration for PVT Lab Systems,
LLC was 5 million US dollars paid in cash. The contingent payment from this arrangement is based on the achievement of
performance-related milestones that may arise until the end of 2012 and the range of outcomes, undiscounted, is between
5 and 27 million euros. A liability of 32 million Swiss francs was recognised at the acquisition date, based on management’s
best estimate of the probability-adjusted expected cash outflow from the arrangement. As at 31 December 2011 the amount
recognised for this arrangement was 31 million Swiss francs based on the most recent management estimates and reflecting
closing balance sheet foreign exchange rates.
mtm laboratories. Effective 31 August 2011 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in the privately owned mtm
laboratories AG (‘mtm laboratories’). Based in Heidelberg, Germany, mtm laboratories develops in vitro diagnostics for the

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 20117. Global restructuring plans
Operational Excellence
On 17 November 2010 the Group announced details concerning the Operational Excellence global restructuring plan.
The plan is aimed at adapting cost structures to an increasingly challenging market environment and achieving significant
efficiency and productivity gains. The planned measures will enable sustained investment in research and product
development and thus strengthen the Group’s long-term innovation capability.
Effective 13 June 2011 the Group completed the sale of the site at Palo Alto, California, to a third party. The consideration
was 204 million Swiss francs in cash, of which 9 million Swiss francs will be paid in 2012. As a result a gain of 45 million
Swiss francs was recorded in 2011 within general and administration expenses. The closure or transfer of the research and
development activities to other Roche sites from Palo Alto was completed by the end of 2010. The subsidiary Roche Palo Alto
LLC, which retains certain residual obligations, was not divested.
During 2011 the Group completed the divestment of certain subsidiaries as part of the Operational Excellence programme.
Effective 31 August 2011 the Group completed the sale of the manufacturing site at Boulder, Colorado. The consideration
includes certain contingent consideration arrangements based on the future performance of the site. As at 30 June 2011
the net assets sold at Boulder were considered a disposal group and were written down to their fair value less costs to sell.
As a result an impairment charge of 117 million Swiss francs was charged to general and administration expenses for the
first half of 2011, of which 99 million Swiss francs relates to property, plant and equipment, and a majority of the residual to
inventories. In the second half of 2011, a further loss of 15 million Swiss francs was recognised from this disposal. Effective
21 October 2011 the Group sold the research and development site in Madison, Wisconsin including selected research assets.
The consideration included an equity stake and contingent consideration arrangements based on the future achievement
of specified research and development project milestones. In the second half of 2011 the Group divested the research site
in Kulmbach, Germany, and a small property in the Philippines.
The total consideration received for these subsidiary divestments was 14 million Swiss francs. This consisted of 2 million
Swiss francs in cash, marketable securities with a fair value of 4 million Swiss francs and deferred cash consideration of
8 million Swiss francs that will be received in 2012. The total loss on divestment of subsidiaries was 105 million Swiss francs
and is included in general and administration expenses in the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment.
The Group has announced that it will not divest the chemical production facility in Florence, South Carolina, given the
unfavourable market for chemical production assets and the Group’s expected future capacity requirements for small
molecules.
The Group currently anticipates that these restructuring activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2012.
The total cost is expected to be in the order of 2.8 billion Swiss francs, which includes 1.3 billion Swiss francs that were
already incurred in 2010 and 0.9 billion Swiss francs incurred in 2011.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011Genentech transaction: restructuring and integration
On 21 July 2008 the Group announced an offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Genentech. Following the closing
of the transaction, Genentech’s South San Francisco site would become the headquarters of the Group’s combined
pharmaceuticals operations in the United States. On 21 July 2008 the Group also announced that Roche’s pharmaceuticals
business in the US would close manufacturing operations at its site in Nutley, New Jersey, and commercial operations
would be moved to Genentech. The research site at Palo Alto, California, would be closed with the research activities being
transferred to Nutley and to Genentech. Subsequent to these announcements, initial restructuring activities started at
the Nutley and Palo Alto sites in 2008. The Genentech transaction was completed effective 26 March 2009. Following this
the Pharmaceuticals Division initiated a detailed integration programme to align the Genentech business and the rest of
Roche’s pharmaceuticals business. These restructuring activities were completed by the end of 2010.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsOther employee benefits consist mainly of life insurance schemes and certain other insurance schemes providing medical
coverage and other long-term and short-term disability benefits. The charges for employee benefits in the operating results
are included in the relevant expenditure line by function. The expected return on plan assets and interest cost from defined
benefit plans are included as part of financial income and financing costs, respectively (see Note 4).
9. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group’s objective is to provide attractive and competitive post-employment benefits to employees, while at the same
time ensuring that the various plans are appropriately financed and managing any potential impacts on the Group’s long-
term financial position. Most employees are covered by pension plans sponsored by Group companies. The nature of such
plans varies according to legal regulations, fiscal requirements and market practice in the countries in which the employees
are employed. Other post-employment benefits consist mostly of post-retirement healthcare and life insurance schemes,
principally in the United States. Post-employment benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the
Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal
or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. All other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’, even if the
Group’s potential obligation is relatively minor or has a relatively remote possibility of arising. Consequently most of the
Group’s post-employment benefit plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’ for the purpose of these financial statements.
Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans typically consist of payments by employees and by the Group to funds administered by third
parties. Payments by the Group were 303 million Swiss francs (2010: 305 million Swiss francs). No assets or liabilities
are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet in respect of such plans, apart from regular prepayments and accruals of
the contributions withheld from employees’ wages and salaries and of the Group’s contributions.
Defined benefit plans
The Group’s major defined benefit plans are located in Switzerland, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and
Japan. Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by payments from the Group and by
employees. In some cases, notably for the major defined benefit plans in Germany, the plans are unfunded and the Group
pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources.
Current and past service costs are charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results.
Pension plan administration and funding is overseen at a corporate level, and any settlement gains and losses resulting
from changes in funding arrangements are reported as general and administration expenses within the Corporate segment.
The expected returns on plan assets and interest costs are charged to financial income and financing costs, respectively.
Actuarial gains and losses are recorded directly in other comprehensive income. The recognition of pension assets is limited
to the total of the present value of any future refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans and
any cumulative unrecognised past service costs. Adjustments arising from the limit on the recognition of assets for defined
benefit plans are recorded directly in other comprehensive income.

The funding of the Group’s various defined benefit plans is overseen at a corporate level. Qualified independent actuaries
carry out valuations on a regular basis and for major plans annually as at the reporting date. For funded plans, which
are usually trusts independent of the Group’s finances, the net asset/liability recognised on the Group’s balance sheet
corresponds to the over/under funding of the plan, adjusted for unrecognised past service costs. For unfunded plans, where
the Group meets the pension obligations directly from its own financial resources, a liability for the defined benefit obligation
is recorded in the Group’s balance sheet. Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless
the Group has a legally enforceable right to use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan. Amounts
recognised in the balance sheet for post-employment benefits are predominantly non-current and are reported in non-
current assets and liabilities.

Actuarial assumptions
Actuarial assumptions are unbiased and mutually compatible estimates of variables that determine the ultimate cost of
providing post-employment benefits. They are set on an annual basis by local management and actuaries and are subject to
approval by corporate management and the Group’s actuaries. Actuarial assumptions consist of demographic assumptions
on matters such as mortality and employee turnover, and financial assumptions on matters such as interest rates, returns on
investments, salary and benefit levels, inflation rates and costs of medical benefits. The Group operates defined benefit plans
in many countries and the actuarial assumptions vary based upon local economic and social conditions.
Demographic assumptions. The most significant demographic assumptions relate to mortality rates. The Group’s actuaries
use mortality tables which take into account historic patterns and expected changes, such as further increases in longevity.
The mortality tables used for the major schemes are:
Germany: Heubeck tables 2005G.
Japan: National Census (No. 20 Life Table).
Switzerland: BVG 2010 generational tables for pensioners and BVG 2010 projected to 2017 for non-pensioners.
United Kingdom: non-pensioners – S1NA_L table rated up 1.5 years (male) and 0.5 years (female). Future improvements:
medium cohort (from 2002) with a 1% underpin (from 2009)
United Kingdom: pensioners – S1NA_L table rated up 1.5 years. Future improvements: medium cohort (from 2002)
with a 1% underpin (from 2009).
United States: RP2000 projected to 2017.
Rates of employee turnover, disability and early retirement are based on historical behaviour within Group companies.
80
Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsFinancial assumptions. These are based on market expectations for the period over which the obligations are to be settled.
The ranges of assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the most significant plans, which are in countries with stable
currencies and interest rates, are shown below.

Discount rates, which are used to calculate the discounted present value of the defined benefit obligation, are determined
with reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds, or government bonds in countries where there is not a deep
market in corporate bonds. The currency and term of the bonds are consistent with the obligation being discounted. The
interest cost included in the income statement is calculated by multiplying the discount rate by the defined benefit obligation.

Expected returns on plan assets are based on market expectations of expected returns on the assets in funded plans over
the duration of the related obligation. This takes into account the split of the plan assets between equities, bonds, property
and other investments. The calculation includes assumptions concerning expected dividend and interest income, realised
and unrealised gains on plan assets and taxes and administration costs borne by the plan. These are based on long-term
market expectations and the actual performance is continually monitored by corporate management. Due to the long-term
nature of the obligations, the assumptions used for matters such as returns on investments may not necessarily be consistent
with recent historical patterns. The expected return on plan assets included in the income statement is calculated by
multiplying the expected rate of return by the fair value of plan assets. The difference between the expected return and the
actual return in any twelve-month period is an actuarial gain/loss and is recorded directly to other comprehensive income.
The actual return on plan assets was a gain of 20 million Swiss francs (2010: gain of 803 million Swiss francs).
Expected rates of salary increases, which are used to calculate the defined benefit obligation and the current service cost
included in the income statement, are based on the latest expectation and historical behaviour within Group companies.
Expected inflation rates are derived by looking at the level of inflation implied by the financial markets in conjunction with
the economists’ price inflation forecasts, historic price inflation as well as other economic variables and circumstances.
81
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011Medical cost trend rates are used to calculate the defined benefit obligation and the current service cost included in the
income statement of post-employment medical plans. These take into account the benefits set out in the plan terms and
expected future changes in medical costs. Since the Group’s major post-employment medical plans are for US employees,
these rates are driven by developments in the United States. The effect of one percentage point increase or decrease in
the medical cost trend rate is shown below.

Based on the most recent actuarial valuations, the Group expects that employer contributions for funded plans in 2012 will
be approximately 302 million Swiss francs, which includes an estimated 71 million Swiss francs of additional contributions.
Benefits paid for unfunded plans are estimated to be approximately 118 million Swiss francs.
82
Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsAmounts recorded in other comprehensive income
The actuarial gains and losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income were losses of 1,184 million Swiss
francs (2010: losses of 344 million Swiss francs), pre-tax. The total amount at 31 December 2011 was an accumulated loss
of 3,030 million Swiss francs (2010: accumulated loss of 1,846 million Swiss francs).
In addition the recognition of pension assets is limited to the total of the present value of any future refunds from the plans or
reductions in future contributions to the plans and the cumulative unrecognised past service costs. Adjustments arising from
this limit on asset recognition are recorded directly in other comprehensive income. In 2011 this adjustment was a decrease
of 6 million Swiss francs (2010: decrease of 2 million Swiss francs).
10. Employee stock options and other equity compensation plans
The Group operates several equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Chugai. Effective 1 January 2005 the
Group adopted IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’. Amongst other matters, the standard requires that the fair value of all equity
compensation plan awards granted to employees be estimated at grant date and recorded as an expense over the vesting
period. The expense is charged against the appropriate income statement heading.

The net cash outflow from transactions in own equity instruments arises from sales and purchases of non-voting equity
securities (Genussscheine) and derivative instruments thereon which are held for the Group’s potential conversion
obligations that may arise from the Group’s equity-settled equity compensation plans. These derivative instruments mainly
consist of call options that are exercisable at any time up to their maturity (see Note 27).
Roche long-Term. During 2005 the Group implemented a new global long-term incentive programme which is available
to certain directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The programme consists of
Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (‘S-SARs’), with the Group having the alternative of granting awards under the
existing Roche Option Plan. In 2009, following the integration of Genentech, the Group also established a Restricted Stock
Unit (‘RSU’) plan. The first awards of this plan were made in September 2009 to employees at Genentech. The S-SARs are
issued in accordance with the Roche S-SAR Plan (the Regulations of 1 January 2005 including amendments effective as
of 1 January 2007 and the addenda, including the Roche S-SAR Plan’s 2009 Addendum United States as of 1 September
2009). The Remuneration Committee determines the number of non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine) that will be
available under the plan each year. The above regulations collectively provide that 60 million non-voting equity securities
(Genussscheine) will be available for issuance under the Roche S-SAR Plan over a ten-year period. The RSUs are issued in
accordance with the Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan (the Regulations effective 1 September 2009), under which 10 million
non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine) will be available for issuance over a ten-year period. Further details of both
plans are given in the relevant sections below.
Share option plans
Roche Option Plan. Awards under this plan give employees the right to purchase non-voting equity securities
(Genussscheine) at an exercise price specified at the grant date. The options, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards,
have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years, subject to continued employment. The Group covers
such obligations by purchasing non-voting equity securities or derivatives thereon (see Note 27). With the introduction of
Roche Long-Term in 2005, the number of options granted under the Roche Option Plan was significantly reduced, as most
eligible employees now receive Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights instead.

allows for the granting of rights to employees and directors of Chugai. Each right entitles the holder to purchase 100 Chugai
shares at a specified exercise price. The rights, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a ten-year duration and
vest after two years.

Volatility for Roche and Chugai options was determined primarily by reference to historically observed prices of the
underlying equity. Risk-free interest rates are derived from zero coupon swap rates at the grant date taken from Datastream.
The early exercise factor describes the ratio between the expected market price at the exercise date and the exercise price
at which early exercises can be expected, based on historically observed behaviour.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsExercise of share options in 2011. The weighted average share price of Roche non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
at the date of exercise of Roche Option Plan options was 143.43 Swiss francs. No share options with Chugai shares as
underlying equity were exercised during the year.
Other equity compensation plans
Bonus Stock Awards. In 2011 50% of the bonus for members of the Corporate Executive Committee was awarded in
the form of immediately vesting non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine). A total of 32,342 awards were issued with
a total fair value of 5 million Swiss francs. The fair value of the awards was calculated on the basis of the market value
of Roche non-voting equity securities at the grant date.
Roche Connect. This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the United States and certain
other countries, to make regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine).
It is administered by independent third parties. The Group contributes to the programme, which allows the employees
to purchase non-voting equity securities at a discount (usually 20%). The administrator purchases the necessary non-
voting equity securities directly from the market. At 31 December 2011 the administrator held 2.2 million non-voting equity
securities (2010: 1.9 million). The programme has been operational since 1 October 2002. During the year the cost of the
plan was 13 million Swiss francs (2010: 14 million Swiss francs), which was reported within the relevant expenditure line
by function.
Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights. With the introduction of Roche Long-Term in 2005, the Group offers
Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) to certain directors, management and employees selected at the
discretion of the Group. The S-SARs give employees the right to receive non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
reflecting the value of any appreciation in the market price of the non-voting equity securities between the grant date and
the exercise date. The rights, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a seven-year duration and vest on a
phased basis over three years, subject to continued employment. The Group covers such obligations by purchasing non-
voting equity securities, or derivatives thereon (see Note 27).

The weighted average fair value of the rights granted in 2011 was calculated using a binomial model. The inputs to the model
were consistent with those used for the Roche Option Plan 2011 awards given previously, except that the expected volatility
was 23.72%. The resulting weighted average fair value per right is 11.78 Swiss francs giving a total fair value of 215 million
Swiss francs which is charged over the vesting period of three years.
Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan. For the first time in September 2009 the Group issued Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)
awards to certain directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The RSUs, which are
non-tradable, represent the right to receive non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine) which vest only after a three-year
period. The weighted average fair value of the awards granted in 2011 was 119.65 Swiss francs calculated on the basis of
the market value of Roche non-voting equity securities at the date of issue, discounted to take into account that the awards
would not accrue for any dividends during the vesting period.

Retirement Gratuities System for Directors which was abolished. The 888 rights issued in 2011 (2010: 716) have a thirty-year
duration and vest upon the holder’s retirement as a director of Chugai. Each right entitles the holder to purchase 100 Chugai
shares at an exercise price of 100 Japanese yen. The total fair value of rights issued was equivalent to 1 million Swiss francs
(2010: 1 million Swiss francs), which was calculated using a binomial model with inputs consistent with those used for the

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsRoche Performance Share Plan. The Group offers future non-voting equity security awards (or, at the discretion of the
Board of Directors, their cash equivalent) to certain directors and key senior managers. The programme was established
at the beginning of 2002 and currently operates in annual three-year cycles. The terms of the currently outstanding awards
are set out in the table below. The amount of non-voting equity securities allocated will depend upon the individual’s salary
level, the achievement of performance targets linked to the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (shares and non-voting equity
securities combined) relative to the Group’s peers during the three-year period from the date of the grant, and the discretion
of the Board of Directors. These are non-tradable equity-settled awards. Each award will result in between zero and two
non-voting equity securities, depending upon the achievement of the performance targets.

The weighted average fair value of the 153,539 awards granted in 2011 was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation.
The input parameters to the model were the covariance matrix between Roche and the other individual companies of the peer
group based on a three-year history and a risk-free rate of 0.7390%. The valuation also takes into account the defined rank
and performance structure which determines the payout of the plan.
Roche Stock Appreciation Rights. Some employees of certain North American subsidiaries of the Group received Stock
Appreciation Rights (SARs) as part of their compensation. The SARs, which were non-tradable cash-settled awards, could
be exercised after a vesting period of between one and three years for a cash payment, based upon the amount by which
the market price of the Group’s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) at the point of exercise exceeds the strike price (grant
price at issuance). Following the implementation of Roche Long-Term (see above), the Group has not awarded any further
cash-settled SARs and no awards have been made since 2004.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsImpairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposal. Factors such as changes in the planned use of buildings, machinery or equipment, or closure
of facilities, the presence or absence of competition and technical obsolescence could result in shortened useful lives or
impairment. Impairment charges of 25 million Swiss francs (2010: 61 million Swiss francs) are reported as part of ‘Cost
of sales’ and 71 million Swiss francs (2010: 71 million Swiss francs) in ‘Research and development’. In 2011 there were no
impairment charges reported within ‘General and administration’ (2010: 6 million Swiss francs).
In 2011 income of 24 million Swiss francs was received from insurance companies in respect of impairments to property,
plant and equipment (2010: none). This was mostly in respect of damage arising from the East Japan Earthquake (see Note 3).
In 2011 no borrowing costs were capitalised as property, plant and equipment (2010: 6 million Swiss francs using a rate
of 4.79%).
leasing arrangements where the Group is the lessee
Finance leases. As at 31 December 2011 the capitalised cost of property, plant and equipment under finance leases was
314 million Swiss francs (2010: 371 million Swiss francs) and the net book value of these assets was 181 million Swiss francs
(2010: 201 million Swiss francs). The carrying value of the leasing obligation was 225 million Swiss francs (2010: 238 million
Swiss francs), which is reported as part of Debt (see Note 26).

Goodwill impairment testing
Pharmaceuticals Division. The division’s sub-divisions are the cash-generating units used for the testing of goodwill. For
Chugai, the recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs to sell, determined with reference to the publicly quoted
share prices of Chugai shares. For Roche Pharmaceuticals, the recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is based
on value in use. The cash flow projections used are based on the most recent business plans approved by management.
These assume no significant changes in the organisation of the division and include management’s latest estimates on sales
volume and pricing, and production and other operating costs. These reflect past experience and are projected over five
years. These valuations also include a terminal value beyond these years, assuming no further growth. The discount rate
used is based on an after-tax rate of 6.57%, which is derived from a capital asset pricing model using data from Swiss capital
markets, including Swiss Federal Government twenty-year bonds and the Swiss Market Index. A weighted average tax rate
of 25.23% is used in the calculations and the corresponding pre-tax discount rate is 8.8%. Management believes that any
reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would not cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed the
recoverable amount.
93
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011Diagnostics Division. | The division’s business areas are the cash-generating units used for the testing of goodwill.
The goodwill arising from the Corange/Boehringer Mannheim acquisition and part of the goodwill from the Ventana
acquisition is recorded and monitored at a divisional level as it relates to the strategic development of the whole division
and cannot be meaningfully allocated to the division’s business areas. Therefore the cash-generating unit for this goodwill
is the entire division. The recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is based on value in use. The cash flow
projections used are based on the most recent business plans approved by management. These assume no significant
changes in the organisation of the division and include management’s latest estimates on sales volume and pricing, and
production and other operating costs. These reflect past experience and are projected over five years. The estimates for
the Tissue Diagnostics business area are projected over ten years, which management believes reflects the long-term nature
of this business. These valuations also include a terminal value beyond these years, assuming no further growth. The discount
rate used is based on an after-tax rate of 6.57%, which is derived from a capital asset pricing model using data from Swiss
capital markets, including Swiss Federal Government twenty-year bonds and the Swiss Market Index. A weighted average
tax rate of 18.80% is used in the calculations and the corresponding pre-tax discount rate is 8.1%. Management believes that
any reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would not cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed
the recoverable amount.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011Internally generated intangible assets
The Group currently has no internally generated intangible assets from development as the criteria for the recognition
as an asset are not met.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
The Group currently has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Impairment of intangible assets
Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposal. Factors such as the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence or lower than
anticipated sales for products with capitalised rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
2011. In 2011 the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment recorded an impairment charge of 79 million Swiss francs and
the Diagnostics operating segment recorded an impairment charge of 59 million Swiss francs.
In the Pharmaceuticals operating segment an impairment charge of 32 million Swiss francs was recorded related to a
decision to stop the development of a project acquired in a business combination that had been out-licensed to an alliance
partner. The asset concerned, which had been partly amortised, was written down to its recoverable value of 29 million Swiss
francs, based on a value in use calculation using an after-tax discount rate of 6.57%. A further charge of 47 million Swiss
francs was recorded, resulting from portfolio prioritisation decisions on projects acquired separately or as part of a business
combination. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully written down by these charges.
In the Diagnostics operating segment, an impairment charge of 59 million Swiss francs was recorded mainly in respect
of intangible assets in use. This followed the regular updating of the division’s business plans and technology assessments
in the second half of 2011. The assets concerned were written down to their recoverable amount of 14 million Swiss francs,
based on a value in use calculation using an after-tax discount rate of 6.57%.
2010. In 2010 the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment recorded an impairment charge of 634 million Swiss francs
and the Diagnostics operating segment recorded an impairment charge of 33 million Swiss francs.
Of the amount recorded in the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment, an impairment charge of 424 million Swiss francs
was recorded as part of the Operational Excellence programme (see Note 7). As part of the programme the division carried out
a comprehensive portfolio review and decided to discontinue certain activities in research and early development. In addition
certain product development activities are being discontinued or transferred to other Roche sites or to third parties. As a result
of these decisions intangible assets with a carrying value of 424 million Swiss francs were fully written down during 2010.
Apart from the Operational Excellence programme, an impairment charge of 179 million Swiss francs was also recorded
in the Pharmaceuticals Division with respect to product intangibles not available for use and follows primarily from recent
clinical data and portfolio prioritisation decisions relating to certain projects either with alliance partners or acquired in
business combinations. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully written down by these
charges. A further charge of 47 million Swiss francs was recorded, resulting from a portfolio prioritisation decision on a
project acquired as part of a previous business combination. The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised,
was written down to its recoverable value of 95 million Swiss francs, based on a value in use calculation using an after-tax
discount rate of 7.31%. A reversal of previously recorded impairment loss of 16 million Swiss francs was recorded, which
followed from the latest clinical data assessment of the project concerned.
In the Diagnostics operating segment, an impairment charge of 33 million Swiss francs was recorded. This was in respect
of intangible assets in use and followed the regular updating of the division’s business plans and technology assessments
in the second half of 2010. The assets concerned were written down to their recoverable amount of 23 million Swiss francs,
based on a value in use calculation using an after-tax discount rate of 7.31%.
96
Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsIntangible assets not available for use. These mostly represent in-process research and development assets acquired
either through in-licensing arrangements, business combinations or separate purchases. As at 31 December 2011 the
carrying value of such assets in the Pharmaceuticals Division is 1,817 million Swiss francs. Of this amount approximately 29%
represents projects that have potential decision points within the next twelve months which in certain circumstances could
lead to impairment. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the research and development processes, intangible assets not
available for use are particularly at risk of impairment if the project in question does not result in a commercialised product.
Potential commitments from alliance collaborations
The Group is party to in-licensing and similar arrangements with its alliance partners. These arrangements may require
the Group to make certain milestone or other similar payments dependent upon the achievement of agreed objectives or
performance targets as defined in the collaboration agreements.
The Group’s current estimate of future third-party commitments for such payments is set out in the table below. These figures
are undiscounted and are not risk adjusted, meaning that they include all such potential payments that can arise assuming
all projects currently in development are successful. The timing is based on the Group’s current best estimate. These figures
do not include any potential commitments within the Group, such as may arise between the Roche and Chugai businesses.

are kept as part of the Group’s strategic alliance efforts. Some unquoted equity investments classified as available-for-sale
are measured at cost, as their fair value cannot be measured reliably. The carrying value of equity investments held at cost
is 53 million Swiss francs (2010: 39 million Swiss francs, 2009: 34 million Swiss francs). Loans receivable comprise all loans
to third parties with a term of over one year.

In 2011 expenses relating to bad debts expensed through marketing and distribution totalled 193 million Swiss francs
(2010: 182 million Swiss francs). Significant concentrations within trade receivables of counterparty credit risk are described
in Note 31.
In the second half of 2010 the Group accepted an offer made by the Greek government to settle 0.4 billion euros of trade
receivables (nominal value) with zero coupon government bonds, redeemable between 2011 and 2013. The settlement terms
implied a discount of 114 million euros, an average discount of 26%. Additional allowances for doubtful accounts totalling
138 million Swiss francs were made in 2010 in respect of this. The bonds were delivered in 2010 and 2011, and at this point
the carrying value of the trade receivables, net of the accumulated allowances for doubtful accounts, was reclassified as
available-for-sale marketable securities. Allowances utilised in this respect totalled 117 million Swiss francs.
Subsequently the Group has sold the vast majority of these bonds during 2011 and the total financial result on the trade
receivables and zero coupon bonds in scope of the settlement was an expense of 2 million Swiss francs. This includes interest
income, gains and losses on sale of bonds, and an impairment of the remaining position to market value at 31 December 2011.

issued to finance the Genentech transaction. The decline compared to 31 December 2010 is mainly due to a strengthening
of the US dollar compared to the euro during 2011.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 201123. Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments as part of its risk management activities. This is discussed in Note 31.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value. The methods used for determining fair value are described in Note 1.

Hedge accounting
The Group’s accounting policy on hedge accounting, which is described in Note 1, requires that to qualify for hedge
accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge
effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
As described in Note 31, the Group has financial risk management policies for foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk,
market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. When deemed appropriate, certain of the above risks are managed by using
derivatives. While many of these transactions can be considered as hedges in economic terms, if the required conditions are
not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged
item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship, which means that any derivatives are reported at
fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial income.
The Group generally limits the use of hedge accounting to certain significant transactions. Consequently as at 31 December
2011 the Group has no fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investment in a foreign entity that meet the strict
requirements to qualify for hedge accounting, apart from those described below.
Cash flow hedges
The Group has issued bonds and notes in 2009 to finance the Genentech transaction (see Note 26). On some of the bonds
and notes which are denominated in euros and sterling, the Group has entered into cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign
exchange and interest rate risk. These cash flow hedges qualify for hedge accounting. As at 31 December 2011 such
instruments, which are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, are recorded as assets with a fair value of 178 million
Swiss francs (2010: assets of 356 million Swiss francs). There was no ineffective portion.
The expected undiscounted cash flows from qualifying cash flow hedges, including interest payments during the duration
of the derivative contract and final settlement on maturity, are shown in the table below. The decline in expected cash flows
is due to a stronger Swiss franc against the euro, US dollar and pound sterling.

The undiscounted cash flows in the table above will affect profit and loss as shown below. These include interest payments

The changes in the hedging reserve within equity are shown in Note 27.
Fair value hedges
During 2011 the Group entered into some interest rate swaps to hedge some of its fixed-term debt instruments.
These instruments, which had been designated and qualified as fair value hedges, were recorded in the balance sheet at
31 December 2011 as assets with a fair value of 9 million Swiss francs. During 2011 a gain of 9 million Swiss francs was
recorded on these interest rate swaps. As the fair value hedge had been highly effective since inception, the result of the
interest rate swaps was largely offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt instruments.
During 2010 there were similar transactions, where the interest rate swaps expired in July 2010 when the underlying bond
was redeemed. During 2010 a loss of 11 million Swiss francs was recorded on these interest rate swaps. As the fair value
hedge had been highly effective since inception, the result of the interest rate swaps was largely offset by changes in the fair
value of the hedged debt instruments.
The Group has equity investments in various biotechnology companies that are subject to a greater risk of market fluctuation
than the stock market in general. To manage part of this exposure the Group has entered into forward contracts, which
have been designated and qualify as fair value hedges. As at 31 December 2011 such instruments are recorded as liabilities
with a fair value of 62 million Swiss francs (2010: liabilities of 7 million Swiss francs). During 2011 a loss of 55 million Swiss
francs was recorded on these forward contracts (2010: loss of 27 million Swiss francs). The result of the forward contracts is
offset by the changes in the fair value of the hedged equity investments.
The Group uses other derivatives, not designated in a qualifying hedge relationship, to manage its exposures to foreign
currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. The instruments used may include interest rate swaps, cross-currency
swaps, forwards contracts, options.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statementslegal provisions
Legal provisions consist of a number of separate legal matters, including claims arising from trade, in various Group
companies. The majority of any cash outflows for these other matters are expected to occur within the next one to three
years, although these are dependent on the development of the various litigations. Significant provisions are discounted by
between 4% and 5% where the time value of money is material.
Environmental provisions
Provisions for environmental matters include various separate environmental issues in a number of countries. By their nature
the amounts and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict. The estimated timings of these cash outflows are shown
in the table above. Significant provisions are discounted by between 5% and 6% where the time value of money is material.
Restructuring provisions
These arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of business undertaken by the Group or the manner
in which business is conducted. Such provisions include only the costs necessarily entailed by the restructuring which are
not associated with the recurring activities of the Group. The timings of these cash outflows are reasonably certain on a
global basis and are shown in the table above. These provisions are not discounted as the time value of money is not material
in these matters.
Employee provisions
These mostly relate to certain employee benefit obligations, such as sabbatical leave and long-service benefits. The timings
of these cash outflows can be reasonably estimated based on past performance and are shown in the table above.
Significant provisions are discounted by 6% where the time value of money is material.
Other provisions
Other provisions mostly relate to sales returns and various other provisions from Group companies that do not fit into the
above categories. The timings of cash outflows are by their nature uncertain and the best estimates are shown in the table
above. Significant provisions are discounted by between 2% and 7% where the time value of money is material.
Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees, to be affected by political,
legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating to environmental protection, in the countries in
which it operates. The industries in which the Group operates are also subject to other risks of various kinds. The nature
and frequency of these developments and events, not all of which are covered by insurance, as well as their effect on future
operations and earnings, are not predictable.
The Group has entered into strategic alliances with various companies in order to gain access to potential new products
or to utilise other companies to help develop the Group’s own potential new products. Potential future payments may
become due to certain collaboration partners achieving certain milestones as defined in the collaboration agreements.
The Group’s best estimates of future commitments for such payments are given in Note 13.
Pharmaceuticals legal cases
Accutane. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (‘HLR’) and various other Roche affiliates have been named as defendants in numerous
legal actions in the United States and elsewhere relating to the acne medication Accutane. The litigation alleges that
Accutane caused certain serious conditions, including, but not limited to, inflammatory bowel disease (‘IBD’), birth defects
and psychiatric disorders. As of 31 December 2011 HLR was defending approximately 6,402 actions involving approximately
6,471 plaintiffs brought in various federal and state courts throughout the United States for personal injuries allegedly
resulting from their use of Accutane. Most of the actions allege IBD as a result of Accutane use. On 26 June 2009 HLR
announced that, following a re-evaluation of its portfolio of medicines that are now available from generic manufacturers,
rapidly declining brand sales in the US and high costs from personal-injury lawsuits that it continues to defend vigorously,
it had decided to immediately discontinue the manufacture and distribution of the product in the United States.
105
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011All of the actions pending in federal court alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District
Litigation in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division. In July 2007 the District
Court granted summary judgment in favour of HLR in the lead federal IBD cases. The plaintiffs appealed and in August 2008
these rulings were affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In October 2009 the District
Court granted summary judgment in favour of HLR in the next five federal IBD cases. The plaintiffs appealed in November
2009 and in May 2010 these rulings were affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Multiple
recently filed matters remain pending.
All of the actions pending in state court in New Jersey alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the
Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County. As of 31 December 2011 juries in the Superior Court have ruled
in favour of the plaintiff in six cases, assessing total compensatory damages totalling 50 million US dollars. The first verdict
was reversed on appeal; the re-trial resulted in a verdict in favour of the plaintiff assessing total compensatory damages of
25.2 million US dollars; HLR is currently in the process of post-trial briefing.
The second verdict of 10.5 million US dollars was reversed on appeal; during 2011, the New Jersey Supreme Court accepted
HLR’s petition for certification to review the decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division regarding
this trial, which remains pending. HLR has appealed the third verdict, which involved three plaintiffs, to the Superior Court of
New Jersey, Appellate Division, which remains pending. In 2011, one trial involving three plaintiffs was tried in the Superior
Court; the jury reached defence verdicts in two of the cases and awarded compensatory damages of 2.15 million US dollars
in the third case; the cases are in post-trial briefing. An additional trial commenced in November 2011 resulting in a mistrial
when the jury could not reach a verdict. The next two trials, involving two plaintiffs each, are scheduled for 2012.
In October 2007 a jury in the Circuit Court of Escambia County, Florida, returned a verdict in favour of the plaintiff, assessing
total compensatory damages of 7 million US dollars, subsequently reduced to 6.8 million US dollars by the Court, against
the Company. In October 2009, the District Court of Appeal, State of Florida, reversed and entered judgment as to HLR.
The Supreme Court of Florida declined to review plaintiff’s appeal.
Additional trials may be scheduled for 2012. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including many that are
unique to the particular case and therefore the trial results to date may not be predictive of future trial results. The Group
continues to defend vigorously the remaining personal injury cases and claims.
Cabilly patents. On 8 October 2009, Glaxo Group Limited, SmithKline Beecham Corporation, and GlaxoSmithKline LLC
(collectively ‘GSK’) filed a patent lawsuit against Genentech and City of Hope in the US District Court for the Southern
District of Florida. The lawsuit relates to patent No. 6,331,415 (‘the Cabilly II patent’) that is co-owned by Genentech and the
City of Hope. The lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity and unenforceability with regard to the Cabilly II
patent and of patent non-infringement with regard to a certain GSK product. On 16 December 2009 Genentech filed a
motion to dismiss, or in the alternative to transfer to the Central District of California. GSK dismissed its Florida lawsuit in its
entirety on 17 February 2010 and filed a related action on the same day in the Northern District of California. Genentech filed
a motion to transfer to the Central District of California, an answer, and a counterclaim against GSK on 10 March 2010.
On 12 April 2010 Genentech’s motion to transfer was granted. On 23 February 2011 the Court issued a claim construction
order, construing certain terms used in claims of the Cabilly II patent. Summary judgment motions are due to be filed on
27 January 2012.
Additional lawsuits between Genentech and GSK and/or Human Genome Sciences, Inc. (‘HGS’) involving the Cabilly II patent
and related US Patent No. 7,923,221 (‘the Cabilly III patent’) are pending in the US District Court for the Central District of
California, but proceedings in those cases have been stayed. The additional lawsuits include claims by GSK and/or HGS that
the Cabilly patents are not infringed, are invalid, and are unenforceable, and that Genentech violated antitrust and unfair
competition laws, and other laws.
The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
106
Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsRituxan arbitration (Sanofi/Hoechst). On 27 October 2008 Genentech and Biogen Idec Inc. filed a complaint against
Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH (‘Sanofi’), Sanofi-Aventis US LLC and Sanofi-Aventis US Inc. in the Northern District of
California seeking a declaratory judgment that certain Genentech products, including Rituxan, do not infringe Sanofi’s US
Patents 5,849,522 and 6,218,140 and a declaratory judgment that the ‘522 and ‘140 patents are invalid. Also on 27 October
2008 Sanofi filed suit against Genentech and Biogen Idec in the Eastern District of Texas, Lufkin Division, claiming that
Rituxan and at least eight other Genentech products infringe the ‘522 and ‘140 patents. Sanofi brought claims for preliminary
and permanent injunctions, compensatory and exemplary damages, and other relief. Genentech challenged the venue of the
Texas case and, after an opinion by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, the Texas and California cases were consolidated in
the Northern District of California. The District Court issued a claim construction order on 23 June 2010. Sanofi filed a motion
for reconsideration that was denied. Genentech and Biogen Idec filed motions for summary judgment that Sanofi opposed.
The Court heard these motions on 12 November 2010 and on 7 March 2011 ruled that as a matter of law Genentech and
Biogen Idec do not infringe any of the asserted patent claims. On 18 May 2011 Sanofi filed a notice of appeal of the Court’s
non-infringement ruling and its claim construction order. The appeal is pending.
In addition on 24 October 2008 Hoechst GmbH filed with the ICC International Court of Arbitration (Paris) a request for
arbitration with Genentech, relating to a terminated agreement between one of Hoechst’s predecessors and Genentech
that pertained to the above patents and related patents outside the United States. Hoechst is seeking payments on royalties
on sales of Genentech products, damages for breach of contract, and other relief. The ICC arbitration hearing was held
on 30 August 2010 through 3 September 2010. In June 2011, the arbitrator issued an intermediate decision indicating that
Rituxan is covered by the terminated agreement and ordering that Genentech produce certain Rituxan sales information
from December 1998 to October 2008. The Group expects that the arbitrator will use this information to ascertain the
amount of damages to be awarded to Hoechst. The Group has recorded an expense of 61 million Swiss francs, net of the
assumed reimbursement of a portion of the Group’s obligation by its co-promotion partner in the US, Biogen Idec. This has
been recorded within ‘Cost of sales’ as a back royalty expense and as a corresponding increase in accrued liabilities on
the balance sheet. The amounts accrued represent management’s best estimate of the compensatory damages, including
interest, which may be awarded to Hoechst based on the financial terms of the terminated agreement. The final amount of
the decision may vary from the amounts provided if the nature and/or extent of the damages awarded to Hoechst differ from
the Group’s estimate or if Genentech successfully challenges the arbitrator’s decision. On 11 July 2011 Genentech filed a
Declaration of Appeal with the Court of Appeal of Paris to initiate legal proceedings challenging the arbitrator‘s decision. The
arbitrator subsequently stated to the parties that his June 2011 decision “did not decide in the operative part the underlying
issue of liability with respect of Rituxan”. In light of that statement, Genentech will not pursue its previously filed action to
challenge the arbitrator’s decision (without prejudicing its ability to bring a challenge in the future). Genentech anticipates
substantially completing briefing on liability, and on the amount owed under the license agreement if the arbitrator were to
find liability, in March 2012. The hearing on those issues is currently scheduled for April or May of 2012.
The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Rituxan investigation. On 4 October 2004 Genentech received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice,
requesting documents related to the promotion of Rituxan. Genentech co-operated with the government’s associated
investigation. Previously the investigation had been both civil and criminal in nature. Genentech was informed in August 2008
by the criminal prosecutor who handled this matter that the government has declined to prosecute Genentech criminally
in connection with this investigation. The civil matter was still ongoing. Through counsel Genentech continued to have
discussions with government representatives about the status of their investigation and Genentech’s views on this matter,
including potential resolution. On 20 October 2009 the government notified Genentech that it had decided not to make
any civil claim against Genentech. The government’s investigation was initiated by a complaint that was filed under seal in
the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in 2003 by an individual plaintiff. The complaint was unsealed
on 31 December 2009 and became the basis of civil litigation by the plaintiff against Roche Holdings, Inc. and Genentech.
Following settlement discussions in 2011, the plaintiff, Genentech, and the government agreed to a settlement of all claims
for approximately 35 million US dollars. The Court entered the order dismissing the case on 29 November 2011.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011Average Wholesale Prices litigation. HLR, Roche Laboratories Inc. (‘RLI’) and Genentech, along with approximately
50 other brand and generic pharmaceutical companies, have been named as defendants in several legal actions in the United
States relating to the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs and State Medicaid reimbursement. The primary allegation in these
litigations is that the pharmaceutical companies misrepresented or otherwise reported inaccurate Average Wholesale Prices
(‘AWP’) and/or Wholesale Acquisition Costs (‘WAC’) for their drugs, which prices were allegedly relied upon by the States
in calculating Medicaid reimbursements to entities such as retail pharmacies. The States, through their respective Attorney
General, are seeking repayment of the amounts they claim were over-reimbursed. The time period associated with these
cases is 1991-2005. As of 31 December 2011, HLR and RLI are defending five actions filed in the following states: Alabama,
Mississippi, New Jersey, Kansas and Louisiana. Genentech is defending one action filed in the state of Kansas. Discovery
is currently pending in each of these cases. HLR, RLI and Genentech intend to vigorously defend themselves in these matters.
The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Brand Name Prescription Drugs litigations. HLR, along with various other branded pharmaceutical companies, has been
named as a defendant in several legal actions in the United States brought by retail pharmacies relating to the discounting
practices for Brand Name Prescription Drugs (‘BNPD’). In these BNPD litigations, the plaintiffs allege that they were denied
discounts for certain prescription drugs that were offered to other mail order and managed care entities, which denial
is claimed to be a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act (‘RPA’). The RPA is a Federal law that prohibits unlawful price
discrimination. In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants conspired in their refusal to offer them certain discounts.
The conspiracy claims against all defendants were previously settled, with only the RPA claims remaining to be litigated.
As of 31 December 2011 HLR is defending approximately 801 BNPD actions brought in various federal and state courts
throughout the United States. Discovery is currently pending in each of these cases. HLR is not currently scheduled for a
trial in any of these BNPD matters in 2012. HLR intends to vigorously defend itself. The outcome of these matters cannot
be determined at this time.
InterMune litigation. On 8 May, 11 June, 8 August, and 29 September 2008, Genentech was named as a defendant, along
with InterMune, Inc. and its former chief executive officer, W. Scott Harkonen, in four separate class-action complaints
filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of plaintiffs who allegedly paid part or all of the
purchase price for a product that was licensed by Genentech to Connectics Corporation and was subsequently assigned to
InterMune. Genentech responded to these complaints with a motion to dismiss these matters, which was granted on 28 April
2009. Plaintiffs filed amended complaints including only state law claims on 28 May 2009. Genentech responded to these
complaints with another motion to dismiss, which was heard on 11 September 2009. The Court again granted Genentech’s
motion to dismiss with respect to all claims, but with leave for plaintiffs to replead specific claims under California unfair
competition law. Plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint on 23 December 2009 naming Genentech as a defendant
in claims for unfair competition law, false advertising law, consumer remedies law, consumer protection law, and unjust
enrichment. Genentech sought dismissal of this amended complaint. On 1 September 2010 the Court entered an order
granting Genentech’s motion to dismiss all claims against it with prejudice. Plaintiffs filed an appeal of the District Court’s
ruling with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On 30 December 2011 the Court of Appeals affirmed
the District Court’s ruling in all respects.
University of Pennsylvania litigation. On 11 May 2010 Genentech filed a patent lawsuit against the University of
Pennsylvania in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit relates to United States Patent
No. 6,733,752 and seeks a declaratory judgment of patent non-infringement and invalidity with regard to that patent. On
12 July 2010 the University counterclaimed against Genentech for infringement of the ‘752 patent, seeking unspecified
damages based on the sales of Herceptin. Genentech filed its answer on 2 August 2010. On 9 May 2011 the Court issued a
claim construction order, construing certain terms used in claims of the ‘752 patent. On 29 December 2011 the University
filed a motion for summary adjudication of certain facts. By order dated 4 January 2012, the Court set 19 April 2012 as
the hearing date for that motion. Trial is currently set for 11 June 2012. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined
at this time.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsPDl litigation. On 27 August 2010 PDL Biopharma (‘PDL’) filed a complaint against Genentech in Nevada state Court
seeking a judicial declaration concerning Genentech’s obligation to pay royalties on certain ex-US sales of Herceptin,
Avastin, Xolair and Lucentis under a 2003 agreement between the parties. On 13 September 2010 PDL filed a first amended
complaint asserting additional claims against Genentech, including breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing. PDL also asserted new claims against Roche and Novartis for intentional interference with
contractual relations. In addition to declaratory relief, PDL is seeking monetary damages including liquidated and punitive
damages. On 1 November 2010 Genentech and Roche filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and Roche filed
an additional motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Court denied the motions on 7 July 2011. The outcome
of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
GSK litigation. On 20 September 2010 GSK and Genentech each filed patent lawsuits against one another (and in the
case of GSK, also against Roche Holding Ltd) in US District Courts for the District of Delaware and the Northern District
of California, respectively. The lawsuits concern GSK’s US Patent Nos. RE41,070 and RE41,555. GSK has asserted claims
against Genentech and Roche alleging infringement of the ‘070 and ‘555 patents by certain ‘therapeutic antibody products,’
although the complaint only specifically refers to Herceptin. In its lawsuit Genentech is seeking a judicial declaration of
non-infringement by certain Genentech products. In the Delaware action on 12 November 2010 Genentech filed a motion
to dismiss for failure to state a claim and a motion to transfer the case to California. Roche filed a motion to dismiss for lack
of personal jurisdiction (and joining Genentech‘s motion in the event its personal jurisdiction motion is denied). The parties
subsequently stipulated to Roche’s dismissal. Only Genentech remains a party and only its motion to transfer the case
to California remains pending. In the California action on 1 December 2010 the Court entered an order staying the California
action pending resolution by the Delaware Court of Genentech‘s motion to transfer. The outcome of these matters cannot
be determined at this time.
Boniva litigation. HLR and various other Roche affiliates have been named as defendants in numerous legal actions in the
United States and Canada relating to the post-menopausal osteoporosis medication Boniva. In these litigations, the plaintiffs
allege that Boniva caused either osteonecrosis of the jaw (‘ONJ’) or atypical femoral fractures. As of 31 December 2011
HLR is defending approximately 122 actions brought in federal and state courts throughout the United States and 1 action
brought in the Court of the Queen’s Bench, Province of Saskatchewan, Canada, for personal injuries allegedly resulting from
the use of Boniva. All of these cases are in the early discovery stages of litigation, with only one case set for trial in December
2012. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including many that are unique to the particular case. HLR and
the other named Roche affiliates intend to vigorously defend themselves in these matters. The outcome of these matters
cannot be determined at this time.
Diagnostics legal cases
Marsh Supermarkets litigation. On 8 July 2008 Marsh Supermarkets Inc. (‘Marsh’) filed a breach of contract suit against
Roche Diagnostics Operations, Inc. (‘RDO’). The lawsuit relates to the termination of a sub-lease agreement for a building
by RDO. After extensive argument during a bench trial a Hamilton Superior Court judge awarded Marsh damages amounting
to 19.5 million US dollars, which has been accrued for as a legal provision in 2011. RDO intends to appeal this judgment.
The outcome of this appeal cannot be determined at this time.

The Group did not issue any bonds or notes in 2011 and 2010.
Redemption and repurchase of bonds and notes – 2011
Redemption of US dollar-denominated notes. On the due date of 25 February 2011 the Group redeemed notes with
a principal of 931 million US dollars at the original issue amount plus accrued original issue discount (‘OID’). The effective
interest rate of these notes was 3 months LIBOR plus 2.10%. The cash outflow was 862 million Swiss francs and there
was no gain or loss recorded on the redemption.
Partial early redemption of US dollar-denominated notes. On 28 December 2010 the Group resolved to exercise its
option to call for redemption a portion of the US dollar-denominated 5.00% fixed rate notes due 1 March 2014. The Group
redeemed 1.0 billion US dollars of the total principal amount of 2.75 billion US dollars of these notes on 24 March 2011
at an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of these notes discounted
to the redemption date at the US Treasury rate plus 0.50%, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal.
The cash outflow was 999 million Swiss francs, plus accrued interest. As at 31 December 2010 the Group had already revised
the carrying value of these notes to take into account the changes to the amounts and timings of the estimated cash flow.
The increase in carrying value of 108 million Swiss francs was recorded within financing costs in 2010. An additional loss
of 2 million Swiss francs was incurred in 2011 upon final settlement of the notes. The effective interest rate of these notes
was 5.31%.
Partial repurchase of euro-denominated notes. On 28 June 2011 the Group completed a tender offer for a nominal
amount of 962 million euros of the 4.625% fixed rate notes due 4 March 2013 with a total principal amount of 5.25 billion
euros. The cash outflow was 1,197 million Swiss francs, plus accrued interest. The loss on repurchase of the notes was
57 million Swiss francs. In addition the Group terminated the currency swaps that were used to hedge the foreign currency
risk on the euro-denominated notes. This created an additional loss of 29 million Swiss francs, reflecting the change in fair
value of the hedging derivatives due to changes in interest rates. The total loss on repurchase of 86 million Swiss francs was
recorded within financing costs (see Note 4). The effective interest rate of the notes repurchased was 5.53%.
112

amount of 250 million pounds sterling. The cash outflow was 88 million Swiss francs, plus accrued interest. The loss on
repurchase of the notes was 16 million Swiss francs. The effective interest rate of the notes repurchased was 5.46%.

Redemption of US dollar-denominated notes. On the due date of 25 February 2010 the Group redeemed notes with a
principal of 3 billion US dollars at the original issue amount plus accrued original issue discount (‘OID’). The effective interest
rate of these notes was 3 months LIBOR plus 1.13%. The cash outflow was 3,244 million Swiss francs and there was no gain
or loss recorded on the redemption.
Redemption of European Medium Term Note programme notes. On the due date of 4 March 2010 the Group redeemed
notes with a principal of 1.5 billion euros at the original issue amount plus accrued original issue discount (‘OID’). The

redemption the US dollar-denominated 4.50% fixed rate notes due 1 March 2012 with a principal of 2.5 billion US dollars.
The Group redeemed these notes on 9 September 2010 at an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining
scheduled payments of these notes discounted to the redemption date at the US Treasury rate plus 0.50%, together with
accrued and unpaid interest on the principal. The effective interest rate of these notes before the redemption was 4.84%.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011Collateral arrangements
The Group has entered into various currency swaps for certain non-US dollar debt instruments that were issued in 2009.
Collateral agreements were entered into with the counterparties to the currency swaps to mitigate counterparty risk. A total
of 0.1 billion Swiss francs cash collateral was delivered to the Group (2010: 1.4 billion Swiss francs delivered by the Group).
This collateral received in 2011 was recorded as an increase in cash and a corresponding increase in accrued liabilities.
The carrying value of accrued liabilities in respect of these agreements at 31 December 2011 was 0.2 billion Swiss francs
(31 December 2010: accrued liabilities of 0.1 billion Swiss francs).

a) The entire losses transferred to income statement of 204 million Swiss francs were reported as ‘Financial income’.
The Group completed the purchase of the non-controlling interests in Genentech effective 26 March 2009. Based on
the revised International Accounting Standard 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ (IAS 27), which was
adopted by the Group in 2008, this transaction was accounted for in full as an equity transaction. As a consequence, the
carrying amount of the consolidated equity of the Group at that time was reduced by 52.2 billion Swiss francs, of which
8.5 billion Swiss francs was allocated to eliminate the book value of Genentech non-controlling interests. This accounting
effect significantly impacted the Group’s net equity, but has no effect on the Group’s business or its dividend policy.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsShare capital
As of 31 December 2011, the authorised and issued share capital of Roche Holding Ltd, which is the Group’s parent
company, consisted of 160,000,000 shares with a nominal value of 1.00 Swiss franc each, as in the preceding year. The
shares are bearer shares and the Group does not maintain a register of shareholders. Based on information supplied to the
Group, a shareholder group with pooled voting rights owns 45.01% (2010: 50.0125%) of the issued shares. On 24 March
2011 the shareholder group announced that it would continue the shareholder pooling agreement existing since 1948
with a modified shareholder composition. The shareholder group with pooled voting rights now holds 72,018,000 shares,
corresponding to 45.01% of the shares issued. This figure does not include any shares without pooled voting rights that
are held outside this group by individual members of the group. Ms Maja Oeri, formerly a member of the pool, holds now
8,091,900 shares representing 5.057% of the voting rights independently of the pool. This is further described in Note 32.
Based on information supplied to the Group, Novartis Ltd, Basel, and its affiliates own 33.3330% (participation below 331⁄%)

of the issued shares (2010: 33.3330%).
Non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
As of 31 December 2011, 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities have been authorised and were in issue as in the
preceding year. Under Swiss company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value, are not part of the
share capital and cannot be issued against a contribution which would be shown as an asset in the balance sheet of Roche
Holding Ltd. Each non-voting equity security confers the same rights as any of the shares to participate in the net profit and
any remaining proceeds from liquidation following repayment of the nominal value of the shares and, if any, participation
certificates. In accordance with the law and the Articles of Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd, the Company is entitled at
all times to exchange all or some of the non-voting equity securities into shares or participation certificates.
Dividends
On 1 March 2011 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of 6.60 Swiss francs per share and non-voting
equity securities (2010: 6.00 Swiss francs) in respect of the 2010 business year. The distribution to holders of outstanding
shares and non-voting equity securities totalled 5,614 million Swiss francs (2010: 5,144 million Swiss francs) and has been
recorded against retained earnings in 2011. The Board of Directors has proposed dividends for the 2011 business year
of 6.80 Swiss francs per share and non-voting equity security which, if approved, would result in a total distribution to
shareholders of 5,865 million Swiss francs. This is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 6 March 2012.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011Non-voting equity securities and derivative instruments are held for the Group’s potential conversion obligations that may
arise from the Roche Option Plan, Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights and Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan
(see Note 10). These mainly consist of call options that are exercisable at any time up to their maturity.
The Group holds none of its own shares.
Reserves
Fair value reserve. The fair value reserve represents the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale financial
assets until the asset is sold, impaired or otherwise disposed of.
Hedging reserve. The hedging reserve represents the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash
flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
Translation reserve. The translation reserve represents the cumulative currency translation differences relating to the
consolidation of Group companies that use functional currencies other than Swiss francs.
28. Earnings per share and non-voting equity security
Basic earnings per share and non-voting equity security
For the calculation of basic earnings per share and non-voting equity security, the number of shares and non-voting equity
securities is reduced by the weighted average number of its own non-voting equity securities held by the Group during the
period.

Diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security, the net income and weighted average
number of shares and non-voting equity securities outstanding are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential shares
and non-voting equity securities.
Potential dilutive effects arise from the employee stock option plans. The exercise of outstanding vested employee stock
options would have a dilutive effect. The exercise of the outstanding vested Chugai stock options would have a dilutive effect if
the net income of Chugai were positive. The diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security reflects the potential
impacts of these dilutive effects on the earnings per share figures.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 201130. Statement of cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities arise from the Group’s primary activities in the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics
businesses. These are calculated by the indirect method by adjusting the Group’s operating profit for any operating income
and expenses that are not cash flows (for example depreciation, amortisation and impairment) in order to derive the cash
generated from operations. This and other operating cash flows are shown in the statement of cash flows. Operating cash
flows also include income taxes paid on all activities.

Cash flows from investing activities are principally those arising from the Group’s investments in property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets, and from the acquisition and divestment of subsidiaries, associates and businesses.
Cash flows connected with the Group’s portfolio of marketable securities and other investments are also included, as are
any interest and dividend payments received in respect of these securities and investments. These cash flows indicate
the Group’s net reinvestment in its operating assets and the cash flow effects of business combinations and divestments,
as well as the cash generated by the Group’s other investments.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsCash flows from financing activities
Cash flows from financing activities are primarily the proceeds from the issue and repayment of the Group’s equity and debt
instruments. They also include interest payments and dividend payments on these instruments. Cash flows from short-term
financing, including finance leases, are also included. These cash flows indicate the Group’s transactions with the providers
of its equity and debt financing. Cash flows from short-term borrowings are shown as a net movement, as these consist of
a large number of transactions with short maturity.
Significant non-cash transactions
There were no significant non-cash transactions in 2011 (2010: none).
31. Risk management
Group risk management
Risk management is a fundamental element of the Group’s business practice on all levels and encompasses different types
of risks. At a group level risk management is an integral part of the business planning and controlling processes. Material
risks are monitored and regularly discussed with the Corporate Executive Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board
of Directors. Financial risk management specifically is described in further detail below.
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising from its underlying operations and corporate finance activities.
The Group’s financial risk exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and
equity prices as well as the creditworthiness and the solvency of the Group’s counterparties.
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies reviewed by the boards of directors of Roche or
Chugai as appropriate to their areas of statutory responsibility. These policies cover credit risk, liquidity risk and market
risk. The policies provide guidance on risk limits, type of authorised financial instruments and monitoring procedures.
As a general principle, the policies prohibit the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.
Policy implementation and day-to-day risk management are carried out by the relevant treasury functions and regular
reporting on these risks is performed by the relevant accounting and controlling functions within Roche and Chugai.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsFollowing the implementation of amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ that were published in March
2009 the Group has established a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in making the fair value
measurements. The fair value hierarchy includes the following three levels:
Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 – observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 3 – unobservable inputs.

Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations, causing financial
losses for the Group. The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses of liquid funds deposited with or
invested in such counterparties.
The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering netting agreements and without
taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements, is equal to the carrying value of the Group’s financial
assets.
Trade receivables. These are subject to a policy of active credit risk management which focuses on the assessment
of country risk, credit availability, ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures. The objective of the
management of trade receivables is to sustain the growth and profitability of the Group by optimising asset utilisation
whilst maintaining risks at an acceptable level. Except as noted below, there is no significant concentration of counterparty
credit risk due to the Group’s large number of customers and their wide geographical spread. Risk limits and exposures
are continuously monitored by country and by the nature of counterparties. Additionally, the Group obtains credit insurance
and similar enhancements when appropriate to protect the collection of trade receivables. As at 31 December 2011 no
collateral was held for loans and receivables (2010: none).
At 31 December 2011 the Group’s combined trade accounts receivable balance with three US national wholesale
distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corp., Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corp., was equivalent to 1.3 billion Swiss francs
representing 13% of the Group’s consolidated trade accounts receivable (2010: 1.1 billion Swiss francs representing 12%).
At 31 December 2011 the Group’s combined trade accounts receivable with public customers in Southern Europe (Spain,
Italy, Greece and Portugal) was equivalent to 2.1 billion Swiss francs representing 21% of the Group’s consolidated trade
accounts receivables (2010: 2.3 billion Swiss francs representing 23%). Trade receivables in Spain, Italy and Portugal
increased during 2011, while receivables in Greece decreased, mainly due to the settlement of trade receivables with zero
coupon government bonds, redeemable between 2011 and 2013. The Group uses different measures to improve collections
in these countries, including intense communication with customers, negotiations of payment plans, charging of interest
for late payments, and legal action.

Cash and marketable securities. These are subject to a policy of restricting exposures to high-quality counterparties
and setting defined limits for individual counterparties. These limits and counterparty credit ratings are reviewed regularly.
Investments in marketable securities are entered into on the basis of guidelines with regard to liquidity, quality and maximum
amount. As a general rule, the Group invests only in high-quality securities with adequate liquidity. Cash and short-term
time deposits are subject to rules which limit the Group’s exposure to individual financial institutions. Within its fixed income
marketable securities, the Group holds 4.4 billion Swiss francs government securities, of which 68% are with Switzerland,
and all of which are with counterparties with a rating of ‘AA’ or better, with the exception of Greece (5 million Swiss francs
as of 31 December 2011). The Greek government bonds, which have been allocated to the ‘Below BBB’ range, relate to
the settlement of overdue receivables in 2010 and 2011.

Derivatives. The Group signs netting and collateral agreements under an ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives
Association) master agreement with the respective counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty risk on derivative
positions. During 2009 the Group entered into derivative contracts with third parties to hedge the foreign exchange risk
arising from bonds and notes issued by the Group’s US affiliate, Roche Holdings, Inc. in currencies other than US dollar.
The total exposure hedged at issuance of these bonds and notes was approximately 25 billion Swiss francs (see Note 26).
In 2010 the Group returned 1.4 billion Swiss francs due to the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro and pound
sterling. A total of 0.1 billion Swiss francs cash collateral was delivered to the Group in 2011. The collateral agreements set
out that only cash is acceptable as collateral. All collateral received or delivered as at 31 December 2011 related to derivative
activities.

liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time.
The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity
requirements at any point in time. Group liquidity is reported to senior management on a monthly basis.
Roche and Chugai enjoy strong credit quality and are rated by at least one major credit rating agency. The ratings will permit
efficient access to the international capital markets in the event of major financing requirements. In addition, the Group
has unused committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling 5.2 billion Swiss francs (2010: 4.5 billion Swiss
francs). The decline in undiscounted financial liabilities, shown in the table below, is mainly due to debt repayments and
interest paid.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsMarket risk
Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities. Market risk may affect
the Group financial result and the value of Group equity.
The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to measure the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. Roche has defined
VaR limits to manage market risk. VaR data are reported on a monthly basis and indicate the value range within which a given
financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices. VaR is a statistical
measure which implicitly assumes that value changes of the recent past are indicative of value changes in the future. VaR
figures do not represent actual or expected losses, or possible worst-case losses over the stated period.
VaR figures are calculated using a historical simulation approach. For each scenario, all financial instruments are fully valued
and the total change in value and earnings is determined. All VaR calculations are based on a 95% confidence level and
a holding period of 20 trading days over the past ten years. This holding period reflects the time required to change the
corresponding risk exposure, should this be deemed appropriate. Longer holding periods increase the probability of higher
value changes and lead to increased VaR figures.
Actual future gains and losses associated with our treasury activities may differ materially from the VaR analyses performed
due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes to interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates and equity investment prices, particularly in periods of high market volatilities. Furthermore, the VaR
numbers below do not include the effect of changes in credit spreads.
Market risk of financial instruments in millions of CHF
31 December 2011 31 December 2010
VaR – Interest rate component 301 466
VaR – Foreign exchange component 49 44
VaR – Other price component 35 34
Diversification (69) (77)
VaR – Total market risk 316 467
At 31 December 2011 the total VaR of the financial assets and liabilities was 316 million Swiss francs (31 December 2010:
467 million Swiss francs). The interest rate VaR decreased to 301 million Swiss francs reflecting the ageing of debt and
the repayment of debt during 2011. As all issued debt is held at amortised cost, the interest rate VaR is a sole metric for
economic fair value changes, but there is no impact on the carrying value or profit and loss of the Group. The foreign
exchange VaR increased slightly due to lower diversification effects. Other price risk arises mainly from movements in
the prices of equity securities and remained largely stable. At 31 December 2011 the Group held equity securities with a
market value of 0.4 billion Swiss francs (31 December 2010: 0.5 billion Swiss francs). This includes holdings in biotechnology
companies, which were acquired in the context of licensing transactions or scientific collaborations.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates across the world and is exposed to movements in foreign currencies affecting the Group financial
result and the value of Group’s equity. Foreign exchange risk arises because the amount of local currency paid or received
for transactions denominated in foreign currencies may vary due to changes in exchange rates (‘transaction exposures’)
and because the foreign currency denominated financial statements of the Group’s foreign subsidiaries may vary upon
consolidation into the Swiss franc-denominated Group Financial Statements (‘translation exposures’).
127
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011The objective of the Group’s foreign exchange risk management activities is to preserve the economic value of its current and
future assets and to minimise the volatility of the Group’s financial result. The primary focus of the Group’s foreign exchange
risk management activities is on hedging transaction exposures arising through foreign currency flows or monetary positions
held in foreign currencies. The Group does not currently hedge translation exposures using financial instruments.
The Group monitors transaction exposures on a daily basis. The net foreign exchange result and the corresponding VaR
parameters are reported on a monthly basis. The Group uses forward contracts, foreign exchange options and cross-
currency swaps to hedge transaction exposures. Application of these instruments intends to continuously lock in favourable
developments of foreign exchange rates, thereby reducing the exposure to potential future movements in such rates.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could affect the Group financial result or the value of Group
equity. Changes in interest rates may cause variations in interest income and expense. In addition, they may affect the
market value of certain financial assets, liabilities and hedging instruments. The primary objective of the Group’s interest rate
management is to protect the net interest result.
Interest rate exposures and the corresponding VaR parameters are reported on a monthly basis. The Group may use forward
contracts, options and swaps to hedge its interest rate exposures. Depending on the interest rate environment of major
currencies, the Group will use these instruments to generate the appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposures.
Other price risk
Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities. The Group manages the price risk through
placing limits on individual and total equity investments. These limits are defined both as a percentage of total liquid funds
and as an absolute number for individual equity investments. Equity price risk is reported as a VaR figure on a monthly basis
to senior management.
Impairment of financial assets
In 2011 and 2010 impairments of loans and receivables were mainly due to an increase in the expected non-recoverability
of trade receivables. The write downs of debt securities of 16 million Swiss francs in 2011 relate to Greek government bonds
received in exchange for trade receivables (see also Note 17).

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsCapital
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total capitalisation, being the sum of debt plus equity, including
non-controlling interests. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide benefits for patients
and returns to investors.
To provide an adequate return to investors based on the level of risk undertaken.
To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver future benefits
for patients and returns to investors.
To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The Group completed the purchase of the non-controlling interests in Genentech effective 26 March 2009 for a
consideration, net of tax effects, of approximately 52.2 billion Swiss francs. Based on the revised International Accounting
Standard 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ (IAS 27), which was adopted by the Group in 2008, this
transaction was accounted for in full as an equity transaction. As a consequence, the carrying amount of the consolidated
equity of the Group was reduced by 52.2 billion Swiss francs, of which 8.5 billion Swiss francs was allocated to eliminate
the book value of Genentech non-controlling interests. This accounting effect significantly impacts the Group’s net equity,
but has no effect on the Group’s business or its dividend policy.
Capital is monitored on the basis of the capitalisation, which is calculated as being debt plus equity (including non-
controlling interests). This is reported to senior management as part of the Group’s regular internal management reporting.
The Group’s capitalisation is shown in the table below.
Capital in millions of CHF

Capitalisation 41,335 41,720 51,830
The Group is not subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements as known in the financial services industry.
The Group has a majority shareholding in Chugai (see Note 3). Chugai is a public company and its objectives, policies and
processes for managing its own capital are determined by local management.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsReport of Roche Management on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
control over financial reporting. The internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance over the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems
determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2011
based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment,
management has concluded that the system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 31 December 2011.
The Statutory Auditor KPMG AG have audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended
31 December 2011, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA).
They have also issued a report on the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control over financial reporting. This
report is set out on pages 140 to 141.

of changes in equity and notes on pages 42 to 136 for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Board of Directors’ Responsibility. The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the
requirements of Swiss law. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control
system relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying
appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s Responsibility. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on
our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, Swiss Auditing Standards and International Standards
on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks
of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of
the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 give a true and fair view
of the financial position, the results of operations and the cash flows in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), and comply with Swiss law.

Roche Group – Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2011Report of the Independent Auditor on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of the Independent Auditor on Internal Control over Financial Reporting to the Annual General Meeting
of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
We have examined the Roche Group’s system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2011, based
on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO).
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as included in the
accompanying Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our examination. An entity’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process effected by the entity’s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial statements prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
the prevention or timely detection of the unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity‘s assets that could have
a material effect on the entity’s financial statements.
We conducted our examination in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000).
This standard requires that we plan and perform our examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our examination included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that
our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of management
override of controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation
of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that internal control may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Group – Report of the Independent Auditor on Internal Control over Financial ReportingIn our opinion, the Roche Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of 31 December 2011 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and International Standards on Auditing,
the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended 31 December 2011 and our report dated
24 January 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Roche Group – Multi-Year Overview and Supplementary Information | Roche Finance Report 2011Core Results and EPS Information
The Group’s basic and diluted earnings per share information is given in Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on
pages 118 to 119. The Group has expanded the presentation of its core results in 2010. Previously only core EPS was shown,
but now the full income statement for the Group and the operating results of the divisions are shown on both an IFRS and
core basis. This allows a transparent assessment of both the actual results and the underlying performance of the business.
The core results concept, which is used in the internal management of the business, is based on the IFRS results, with the
following adjustments:
Global restructuring costs (see Note 7) are excluded.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (see Note 13) are excluded.
Acquisition accounting and other one-time impacts from Alliance arrangements and Business Combinations (see Financial
Review) are excluded.
Discontinued operations (currently none) would be excluded.
Legal and environmental expenses (see Financial Review) are excluded.
Global issues outside the healthcare sector beyond the Group’s control are excluded. In 2011 this includes the directly
attributable costs of the earthquake that occurred in Japan on 11 March 2011 (see Note 3). There were no such items in
2010.
Material one-time treasury items such as major debt restructurings or settlement of pension plans (both currently none)
would be excluded.
The tax benefit recorded under IFRS in respect of Equity Compensation Plans (ECPs), which varies according to price
of the underlying equity, is replaced by a normalised tax benefit, being the IFRS 2 expense multiplied by the applicable tax
rate (see Note 5).
The core results concept was further described on 22 October 2010 at an Investor Update teleconference, which is available
for download at: http://www.roche.com/investors/ir_agenda/csr_151010.htm
The Group’s IFRS results, including the divisional breakdown, are reconciled to the core results in the tables below. The
calculation of core EPS is also given in the tables below. To avoid double-counting, amounts shown for ‘Global Restructuring’
below exclude items in 2010 from the Operational Excellence programme that are included in the other adjustment columns:
these are impairment of intangible assets totalling 424 million Swiss francs (see Note 7). Additional commentary to the
adjustment items is given in the Financial Review.

Bonus/Special Stock Awards. During 2009 the Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate
Executive Committee were granted a total of 96,750 Special Stock Awards. The Chairman of the Board of Directors received
34,084 awards and members of the CEC received a total of 62,666 awards, of which 20,450 awards were granted to Dr Schwan.
The fair value of these awards for the employee is calculated based on the fair value of non-voting equity securities
(Genussscheine) at the grant date (CHF 146.70 or CHF 169.40) discounted to take into account the period in which they are
blocked (3 years: 83.962%, 10 years: 55.839%). There were no such awards in 2010. In 2011 50% of the bonus for members
of the Corporate Executive Committee was awarded in the form Bonus Stock Awards. The members of the CEC received
a total of 32,342 awards, of which 10,214 awards were granted to Dr Schwan. The fair value of these awards for the employee
is calculated based on the fair value of non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine) at the grant date discounted to take
into account the period in which they are blocked (3 years: 83.962%, 10 years: 55.839%).
Employer contribution to social security schemes and pension plans. The Group pays social insurance contributions
in respect of the above remuneration and pays contributions to pension and other post-employment benefit plans for
the Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate Executive Committee.
Equity Compensation Plans. The Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate Executive Committee
also participate in certain equity compensation plans as described below. The terms and vesting conditions of these
awards are disclosed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair values used in the Consolidated
Financial Statements represent the cost to the company at grant date and reflect amongst other matters the observed
exercise behaviour and exit rate for the whole population that receive the awards and initial simulations of any performance
conditions. For the purposes of these remuneration disclosures the values are calculated based on the fair value that the
employee receives taking into account the preliminary assessment of any completed performance conditions.

Roche Finance Report 2011 | Roche Holding Ltd, Basel – Notes to the Financial StatementsThe Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate Executive Committee are eligible to participate in
Roche Connect, a programme that enables employees to make regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting
equity securities. The Group contributes to the programme, which allows the employees to purchase non-voting equity
securities at a discount (usually 20%).
During 2011 members of the Corporate Executive Committee were granted 572,121 Stock-settled Stock Appreciation
Rights (S-SARs). The individual awards relating to 2011 are shown in the table below. The fair value of these awards for the
employee is 8,811,711 Swiss francs, which is calculated using the Black-Scholes formula, assuming holding until maturity,
and deducting 11% for the average two-year vesting period.
Members of the Corporate Executive Committee and other members of senior management participate in the Roche
Performance Share Plan (PSP). The Group has three overlapping three-year PSPs. The target awards for the three-year cycle
are defined at the beginning of the cycle and the awards are considered to form part of the employee’s remuneration in three
equal annual amounts over the three-year cycle. Each award will result in between zero and two non-voting equity securities
(Genussscheine), depending upon the achievement of the performance targets, and the discretion of the Board of Directors.
The individual awards relating to 2011 are shown in the table below. The number of the awards is calculated as follows:
PSP 2009–2011: At the end of the cycle the performance targets were not achieved and accordingly the participants
received none of the originally targeted non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine).
PSP 2010–2012: One non-voting equity security (Genussschein) per award.
PSP 2011–2013: One non-voting equity security (Genussschein) per award.
The resulting allocations are multiplied by the non-voting equity security (Genussschein) price at 31 December 2011
of 159.20 Swiss francs to give the fair value for the remuneration received by the employee.

Roche Holding Ltd, Basel – Appropriation of Available Earnings | Roche Finance Report 2011Report of the Statutory Auditor
on the Financial Statements
Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Financial Statements to the Annual General Meeting
of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
As statutory auditor, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, which comprise the
income statement, balance sheet and notes on pages 155 to 165 for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Board of Directors’ Responsibility. The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements
in accordance with the requirements of Swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation. This responsibility includes
designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting
and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s Responsibility. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor
considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the entity’s internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion.
Opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 comply with Swiss law and
the company’s articles of incorporation.

The 2007 results show continuing strong operating performance both at a sales and an operating profit margin
level, with the main impetus coming from the Pharmaceuticals Division.
Total sales grew by 10% in local currencies (10% in Swiss francs; 15% in US dollars) to 46.1 billion Swiss francs,
with the Pharmaceuticals Division representing 80% of Group sales and the Diagnostics Division contributing
20%. The incremental sales increase of 4.1 billion Swiss francs was achieved through organic growth. Demand
for the Group’s oncology drugs Avastin, Herceptin, MabThera/Rituxan, Tarceva and Xeloda continued to be
strong. Additional growth drivers in the Pharmaceuticals Division were the ophthalmology drug Lucentis,
Bonviva/Boniva in metabolism/bone, CellCept in transplantation and Pegasys in virology. In the Diagnostics
Division the growth areas were Professional Diagnostics, Diabetes Care and Applied Science.
The Group’s operating profit increased by 22% in local currencies to 14.5 billion Swiss francs. The corresponding
operating profit margin grew by 3.5 percentage points to 31.4%, driven by the increase in Pharmaceuticals of
3.8percentage points, and by the 1.3 percentage point increase in Diagnostics. This margin growth was achieved
at the same time as the Group continued to increase investments in launch and pre-launch activities and in
particular in the strong development pipeline. The increase in the Diagnostics margin was driven by the sales
growth, a release of accruals following the BioVeris acquisition and the positive effect of the absence in 2007 of
intangible asset impairment charges.
The exchange rate impact on sales and operating profit growth as expressed in Swiss francs was moderate,
with Swiss-franc sales growth being equal to local-currency growth, while Swiss-franc operating profit growth
was around 1 percentage point higher. In 2007 the average exchange rate for the euro was 4% higher than in
thecomparative period while the US dollar was 4% lower, and the Japanese yen lost around 6%.

Pharmaceuticals operating results
The Pharmaceuticals Division increased its sales by 11% in local currencies (10% in Swiss francs; 15% in
US dollars) to 36.8 billion Swiss francs, approximately twice the global market growth rate. Operating profit
was 13.0 billion Swiss francs, representing growth of 22% in local currencies, and the corresponding margin
increased by 3.8 percentage points to 35.5%.
The increase in marketing costs was significantly less than the growth in sales due to continued productivity
improvements. The increase reflects support costs for the growing oncology portfolio with broader indications
particularly for Avastin, as well as investments for the launch of Bonviva/Boniva, Lucentis and Mircera and the
re-launch of Tamiflu for seasonal use. The growth in research and development expenses exceeded the increase
in sales driven by the significant investments in the strong pipeline reflecting the expanded portfolio and the
largenumber of clinical trials.
For more information on the divisional business and its pipeline, see the Business Report (pages12–28).

Sales:Sales of the division’s oncology portfolio grew by 20% in 2007 and now account for 50% of pharmaceutical
sales. Excluding supportive care products, combined sales of cancer therapeutics rose 23%, increasing the Roche
Group’s share of the global market for cancer medicines to just under 30%. Other therapeutic areas also
performed strongly, notably Metabolism/Bone and Inflammation/Autoimmune/Transplantation, two key pillars of
growth for Roche.

1) Excluding Tamiflu pandemic government and corporate sales.
In 2007 the division’s top 20 products, representing 83% of the Pharmaceuticals portfolio, grew by 15%, with most
products recording strong sales growth. The main sales growth of the Pharmaceuticals Division was driven by
the following key products: Avastin, Herceptin, MabThera/Rituxan, Lucentis, Bonviva/Boniva, Tarceva, Xeloda,
CellCept and Pegasys. Together, these products accounted for 60% of total sales and generated an additional
4.4billion Swiss francs of sales revenue compared with 2006.
Only six of the top 20 products (Tamiflu, NeoRecormon/Epogin, Kytril, Xenical, Nutropin and Rocephin) recorded
sales decreases. After peak pandemic stockpiling sales of 2.1 billion Swiss francs in 2006, the governmental
andcorporate uptake of Tamiflu slowed, as expected, with sales of 1.9 billion Swiss francs in 2007, down by 11%.
The decrease in product sales for renal anemia was in particular due to significantly lower Epogin revenue in
Japan, reflecting the ongoing impact of government-mandated price cuts and reimbursement changes. Following
patent expiry of a competitor product in the United States, Kytril sales decreased by 12%. The decline of 4%
inthe‘Other products’ category resulted primarily from generic erosion and reduced sales of Viracept following
therecall announced on 6 June 2007.

1) Inflammation/Autoimmune/Transplantation.
MabThera/Rituxan: Double-digit sales growth was driven by increasing use in oncology indications and
rheumatoid arthritis. In Europe and the US most of the oncology sales growth was due to increasing usage
of MabThera/Rituxan following first-line therapy of indolent non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), including
maintenance use. The already high penetration rates for first-line treatment of indolent and aggressive NHL were
sustained in the US and Europe’s five largest markets (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom),
while increasing adoption in these settings was seen in emerging markets. Adoption in rheumatoid arthritis
continued to increase in both the US and Europe/RoW.
Herceptin: Growth continued to be driven by increasing adoption in adjuvant (= early stage) HER2-positive
breast cancer. Roche estimates that by the end of 2007 the product’s market share in the adjuvant setting was
approximately 70% (versus 40% a year earlier) in the five largest European markets. Elsewhere, market
penetration in this setting also continues to build. In the US penetration into this market flattened during 2007
due to earlier, more rapid adoption of Herceptin for adjuvant treatment. In the metastatic setting, adoption rates
and treatment duration remained stable both in the US and in the top five European markets.
Avastin: Sales increased 41% worldwide compared with 2006, with strong growth in all regions, particularly
Europe/RoW (+64%). In the US growth was driven primarily by increased usage in advanced non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), an indication approved in late 2006. In Europe sales growth was propelled by further uptake of
the product in the metastatic colorectal cancer setting. Avastin received EU approval in metastatic breast cancer
in March and for first-line treatment of patients with NSCLC in August 2007, and initial uptake in these new
indications is encouraging. In 2007 Avastin was approved and launched in Japan for the treatment of metastatic
colorectal cancer.
NeoRecormon/Epogin: Combined sales of Roche’s NeoRecormon and Chugai’s Epogin (epoetin beta) were
down 7% in a market that remains highly competitive due to pricing pressure from branded competitors and
the entry of biosimilar versions of epoetin alfa in Europe. While the decline in NeoRecormon sales was 4%,
salesofEpogin in Japan (–14%) were affected by competitive pricing pressures and, in the first quarter of 2007,
the residual impact of government-mandated price cuts and reimbursement changes.
Tamiflu: Sales of Tamiflu in 2007 declined by 542 million Swiss francs or 19% versus 2006. Seasonal sales
were265 million Swiss francs lower and pandemic sales decreased by 277 million Swiss francs compared to 2006,
as most stockpiling programmes from governments and corporations were completed. Seasonal sales of
Tamiflu in Japan were negatively affected by the mild 2006/2007 flu season. This was more than outweighed,
however, by a substantial increase in pandemic sales to the Japanese government.
CellCept:The immunosuppressant CellCept continued to record steady sales growth worldwide (+10%), driven
by solid demand in both the US and Europe. Growth continues to be driven by physicians’ recognition of the
long-term protective benefits of CellCept in transplant patients compared with other, more toxic therapeutic
options.
Pegasys: With market share of over 60%, Pegasys remains the global market leader in the treatment of
hepatitis C. Sales were driven by increased use in Europe/RoW, offsetting a decline in the US from an overall
market volume decline. Market response has been positive in Japan following the 2007 rollout of combined
Pegasys plus Copegus for hepatitis C.
Finance Report 2007 7Roche Group
Financial Review
Xeloda:The main contributions to double-digit growth of Xeloda (+19%) in 2007 came from the US (+19%) and
Europe/RoW (+19%). Sales growth was driven by increased usage of Xeloda in the adjuvant colon and metastatic
colorectal cancer settings, as well as the European launch in gastric cancer.
Tarceva:Tarceva recorded strong growth in 2007 (+31%), particularly in the Europe/RoW sales region (+76%),
which now accounts for 53% of overall sales. US sales increased by 4% in a competitive market environment.
Tarceva is still the only epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor with a proven survival benefit in advanced lung
and pancreatic cancer.
Lucentis:Following US approval in June 2006, Lucentis experienced very rapid uptake driven by high demandfor
the treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). Lucentis sales in the USgrew
117% in 2007, however during the year sales growth flattened as the medicine captured a significant market
share, while off-label usage of an unapproved therapy in wet AMD remained high. Outside the US, Lucentis
ismarketed by Novartis.
Bonviva/Boniva:In a highly competitive market, sales of Bonviva/Boniva (ibandronic acid), for the treatment of
postmenopausal osteoporosis, increased by 399 million Swiss francs to 887 million Swiss francs compared with
2006. The majority of sales come from the US, where the product’s market share (total prescriptions) increased
to around 15%. Bonviva gained reimbursement status and was launched in many European markets in 2006.
Xenical:Sales of the prescription weight-loss medication Xenical (orlistat 120mg) declined 10% worldwide and
27% in the United States, where Roche’s partner GlaxoSmithKline has successfully launched non-prescription
orlistat 60mg under the brand name alli. As licensor, Roche receives royalties on sales of alli.
See the Business Report (Part 1 of this Annual Report) for more information on Roche’s pharmaceutical products
(pages 12–28) including the R&D pipeline (page 25.1).
Sales by region:Sales continued to grow across all regions, particularly in North America, Europe and emerging
markets. North American sales grew at almost three times the market rate, driven by products marketed by
Genentech (+19%). Roche continued to gain market share in Europe and Rest of World, driven by further
strongsales growth of Herceptin, Avastin, MabThera/Rituxan, Tarceva, Pegasys, and Bonviva/Boniva.

Royalties and other operating income: The increase of 848 million Swiss francs, or 76% in local currencies,
was mainly due to high out-licensing income. Royalty income increased by 213 million Swiss francs or 29% in
local currencies, driven by income from Novartis (Lucentis), Amgen (Enbrel) and GSK (alli). There was an
increase of 242 million Swiss francs in income from out-licensing orlistat OTC rights to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).
Genentech generated an additional 114 million Swiss francs of out-licensing income, including 80 million
Swiss francs recorded as part of a new third-party collaboration agreement and 42 million Swiss francs
milestone income relating to Lucentis for approval in the European Union and filing in Japan. At Chugai there
were 58 million Swiss francs of additional third-party royalties and other operating income, including milestone
income from the co-development and co-marketing agreement with Taisho on Bonviva. Gains on product
divestments were also significantly higher compared to 2006 and include a gain of 62 million Swiss francs from
the disposal of several cardiovascular products and a gain of 152 million Swiss francs from the first stage of
thedisposal of three products to Actavis as part of the continuous realignment of the product portfolio. Royalties
and other operating income as percentage of sales increased by 2.0 percentage points to 5.6%.

Cost of sales:The increase of 8% in local currencies was below the increase in sales. There was a growth of 11%
in royalty expenses on product sales, driven by the success of MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin, Tarceva, CellCept,
Lucentis and Avastin, partially off-set by lower expenses for Tamiflu, NeoRecormon and Viracept. Genentech’s
collaboration profit-sharing expenses with its partners Biogen Idec, Novartis and OSI increased to 1,297 million
Swiss francs (2006: 1,260 million Swiss francs) due to increased sales of MabThera/Rituxan, Xolair and Tarceva,
respectively. Additionally the gross profit share to GlaxoSmithKline, increased to 379 million Swiss francs
(2006: 219 million Swiss francs) following increased Bonviva/Boniva sales. These factors were largely compen-
sated for by manufacturing efficiencies and product mix effects, despite some 135 million Swiss francs of costs
for the Viracept recall. Amortisation of intangible assets remained stable. As a percentage of sales, cost of
salesdecreased to 25.8% from 27.1% in 2006.

Marketing and distribution: The increase of 3% in local currencies was significantly below sales growth due
to continued productivity improvements. Major activities in 2007 included the support for the strong oncology
portfolio, notably for Avastin in lung and breast cancer indications as well as Tarceva in pancreatic cancer in
Europe. Other main areas of focus were Pegasys and Bonviva/Boniva. In addition there were pre-launch and
launch costs for Mircera and in Japan the sales force was significantly increased in preparation for the launches
of Avastin, Tarceva and Actemra. In addition Tamiflu’s use in both seasonal flu and pandemic planning has
beenfurther promoted. Marketing and distribution costs as a percentage of sales were 19.1% (2006: 20.6%).
Research and development: The increase of 1.0 billion Swiss francs, or 18% in local currencies, to almost
7.6 billion Swiss francs reflects higher spending as a result of the increased portfolio size and large number of
late-stage clinical trials. Significant work took place on late-stage projects driven by the many potential line
extensions, especially for Avastin in oncology and for MabThera/Rituxan and Actemra in rheumatoid arthritis.
Research and development costs as a percentage of sales were 20.7% compared to 19.8% in 2006. In addition
thePharmaceuticals Division in total spent 735 million Swiss francs on capitalised assets for pipeline compounds
and technologies through in-licensing. In total the division spent 8.2 billion Swiss francs on internal and
purchased R&D from in-licensing deals, representing 22.4% of sales.

dueto a variety of factors. Administration costs, which grew by 8%, include a project to harmonise the business
processes and SAP systems across Europe as well as to establish a European shared services centre in Budapest.
Legal expenses, which are also included in Administration costs, were substantially higher compared to 2006.
Excluding these items, administration costs increased by 3%. In addition restructuring expenses were significantly
higher primarily as a result of a reduction of the sales forces in the US and Europe. General and administration
expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 4.6% from 4.4%.

10 Finance Report 2007Roche Group
Financial Review
Roche Pharmaceuticals: Sales increased strongly by 9% in local currencies and the operating profit margin
increased by 1.8 percentage points to 31.5% in spite of significantly higher research and development expenses.
Positive developments include increased income from out-licensing and product disposals and a lower marketing
and distribution cost ratio. These more than compensated for higher expenses to alliance and collaboration
partners, which include royalty expenses to third parties of 1.3 billion Swiss francs and to Genentech of 1.4 billion
Swiss francs as well as profit sharing arrangements, and also higher general and administration costs. Moreover,
Roche Pharmaceuticals continued to significantly increase its investments in research and development. Costs of
around 135 million Swiss francs for sales returns, inventory provisions and other costs were recorded following
the recall of Viracept announced on 6 June 2007.
Genentech: Sales grew by 19% in local currency. The operating profit margin significantly improved by
7.0 percentage points to 50.9%, mainly driven by substantially higher royalty and other operating income from
third parties, by royalty income from Roche Pharmaceuticals and also by the growth in marketing and distribution
expenses being considerably below sales growth, all of the above compensating for the strong increase in
investments in R&D.
Chugai:Sales increased 3% in local currencies, which is slightly below market growth in Japan. Chugai’s sales
excluding Tamiflu pandemic rose by 1% in local currencies. Operating profit at Chugai increased by 21% in
local currency due to out-licensing income from third parties and from Roche Pharmaceuticals offsetting an
unfavourable product mix impact driven by an increased share of Tamiflu government pandemic sales. In Swiss
franc terms, this resulted in an increase of 1.7 percentage points in the operating profit margin to 17.9%.
Additional information on the Pharmaceuticals Division’s sub-divisional results is given in Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements and further information on Genentech and Chugai is given in Notes 3 and 4.
Diagnostics operating results
In 2007 Roche’s Diagnostics Division remained the global leader in the in vitrodiagnostics market with a market
share of around 19%. Divisional sales increased to 9.3 billion Swiss francs, growing 6% in local currencies (7% in
Swiss francs; 12% in US dollars) compared to 2006. Operating profit increased by 14% in local currencies
to 1.6 billion Swiss francs and the operating profit margin improved by 1.3 percentage points to 17.6%. Cash
generation of the business remains well above industry average with an EBITDA margin of 27.6%.
The operating profit margin improvement was driven by sales growth and positively impacted by the reversal
of royalty accruals following the acquisition of BioVeris and the absence of the significant impairment charges
onintangible assets recorded in the second half of 2006. These factors compensated for continued investments
in new and existing products, considerably higher general and administration costs, mainly due to increased
provisions for legal and environmental settlements, and post-acquisition restructuring expenses at BioVeris.
During 2007 the division completed the acquisition of BioVeris, 454 Life Sciences and NimbleGen for a total
consideration of 1.2 billion Swiss francs. In January 2008 the Group signed an agreement to acquire Ventana
Medical Systems for approximately 3.4 billion US dollars. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first
half of 2008.

Sales: The Professional Diagnostics, Diabetes Care and Applied Science businesses were the growth drivers,
with the biggest contributions coming from their immunochemistry, blood glucose monitoring and DNA
sequencing products, respectively. Molecular Diagnostics continued to be affected by the declining sales of
industrial reagents due to expiration of Roche’s foundational PCR patents. Excluding this part of the business,
Molecular Diagnostics sales grew 3%.

Professional Diagnostics:Roche Professional Diagnostics gained market share in 2007 as its sales increased
8% in local currencies to 4.3 billion Swiss francs. Immunochemistry sales rose 13% in local currencies to 1.3 billion
Swiss francs, outpacing the market for the seventh consecutive year. Growth was fuelled by demand for the
Elecsys NT-proBNP and Troponin T cardiac tests and an assay for TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). New
tests launched in the second half of 2007 for vitamin D (osteoporosis) and MPA (therapeutic monitoring of
CellCept and other mycophenolic acid therapies in transplant recipients) are expected to contribute to future
growth. The clinical chemistry business grew despite the highly competitive, cost-sensitive market. Demand
for the cobas 6000 analyser series for medium-workload laboratories remained strong. Introduced in 2006, this
series was the first of several modular platforms designed to integrate and improve the efficiency of clinical
chemistry and immunochemistry testing in different sized laboratories. The cobas e 411 immunochemistry
analyser, the first of the cobas 4000 instruments for small- to medium-size laboratories, was released in the first
half of the year. The cobas c 311 clinical chemistry analyser is on track for launch in 2008.
The acquisition of BioVeris was completed in June 2007, enabling Roche to expand its immunochemistry business
into new market segments such as life science research, drug development and clinical trials. Also in June 2007
Roche and Sysmex Corporation of Japan signed a ten-year extension of an agreement giving Roche exclusive
distribution rights for Sysmex hematology instruments in some markets in Europe, Latin America, Southern Africa
and Oceania. In November Roche signed a licensing agreement with Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc., and
Novartis Vaccines & Diagnostics giving Roche access to their broad portfolio of hepatitis C virus (HCV) patents,
further strengthening our immunochemistry menu.
12 Finance Report 2007Roche Group
Financial Review
Sales of point-of-care (POC) diagnostics, (previously Near Patient Testing), rose 7% in local currencies to
814 million Swiss francs, helped by improved marketing of the business area’s broad portfolio and by the
continued move towards decentralised testing. Coagulation monitoring sales increased driven by the CoaguChek
XS monitor for patient use and the CoaguChek XS Plus monitor for healthcare professionals. These systems
were released in the US and Japan in the first half of 2007. Sales of POC cardiac markers accelerated
further following the launch of the cobas h 232 portable cardiac testing system in February. In the ambulatory
care arena, the launch in November of the Accutrend Plus is expected to boost growth in 2008. This is the
first hand-held instrument capable of measuring cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose and lactate levels in blood,
using asingle meter.
Diabetes Care: Roche Diabetes Care remained the global market leader with sales of 3.2 billion Swiss francs,
anincrease of 5% in local currencies. The Accu-Chek Aviva and Accu-Chek Compact blood glucose systems both
sold well, compensating for lower sales of the older Accu-Chek Advantage. Accu-Chek Active sales were
especially strong in some EMEA and South American markets. Roche’s insulin delivery business grew 12%
in local currencies driven primarily by the European and North American markets. US market uptake of the
Accu-Chek Spirit insulin pump was positive. The business introduced two new glucose systems during 2007:
the Accu-Chek Performa, which automatically corrects for environmental factors that can affect test results,
andthe new all-in-one Accu-Chek Compact meter and lancing device launched in the fourth quarter in Germany,
the UK and Norway. Accu-Chek 360°, a software package that helps people with diabetes and their healthcare
professionals to store, access and review detailed health information quickly and conveniently, was also added
tothe portfolio. The rollout of all three new products will continue in 2008.
Molecular Diagnostics: Roche Molecular Diagnostics remained the clear leader in a market with an increasing
number of players, with sales of 1.1 billion Swiss francs, and an overall decline of 2% in local currencies. Excluding
industrial reagent sales, which markedly declined as expected, growth was 3%. Sales of virology products grew
4% in local currencies, driven by continued placements of the automated Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan
(CAP/CTM) platform in Europe and Asia–Pacific and the rollout of this platform in the US and Japanese markets
in the second half of 2007. Blood screening sales decreased 1% in local currencies. Uptake of the cobas s 201
modular blood screening system remained strong. In Europe more than 50 sites have adopted this system and the
cobas TaqScreen MPX multiplex test (which simultaneously detects HIV, HCV and HBV in donated blood or
plasma) since their European rollout in 2006. Roche introduced the cobas s 201 system in the US with a West Nile
virus test in the second half of 2007. Notable contracts for 2007 include a three-year deal to supply an automated
CAP/CTM HIV-1 test to LabCorp in the US and a five-year contract with the Japanese Red Cross (JRC) for the
fully automated and integrated cobas s 401 system and cobas TaqScreen MPX multiplex test, which will be used
to screen all of the JRC’s roughly five million annual blood donations.
Applied Science: Roche Applied Science’s sales grew well ahead of the market, rising 11% in local currencies
to 692 million Swiss francs. The main growth drivers were again the LightCycler 480 system (for high-throughput
real-time PCR), the Genome Sequencer systems (DNA sequencing) and research reagents. The business area
gained significant market share in the fast-growing sequencing area and retained its share of the genomics
systems market. Marketing of NimbleGen arrays has started under Roche’s name and the integration of
NimbleGen and 454 Life Sciences into the business area is progressing as planned. Roche has more than doubled
its share of the rapidly expanding market for DNA sequencing products.
Sales by regions: Sales continued to grow ahead of or in line with the market in all regions. All regions
contributed to growth, with sales advancing at double-digit rates in Latin America and Asia–Pacific and at
single-digit rates in Europe, North America and Japan. Sales in Asia–Pacific grew almost twice as fast as the
market.

Cost of sales: The overall decrease was 2% in local currencies. Manufacturing cost of goods sold and period
costs increased 7%, slightly more than sales. Royalty expenses decreased considerably by 44% in local currencies
to 215 million Swiss francs. This is primarily due to the reversal in the first half of 2007 of 57 million Swiss francs
of BioVeris royalty accruals. In the second half of 2006 BioVeris royalty accruals of 111 million Swiss francs were
booked. Excluding BioVeris, royalty expenses were 272 million Swiss francs, an increase of 6% in local currencies
which is in line with the increase in sales. Furthermore, cost of sales in 2006 included an impairment charge for
intangible assets of 118 million Swiss francs. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased to 45.4% from
48.6% in 2006. Excluding BioVeris royalties and the impairment of intangibles it was stable at 46.0% in both years.

due to strong investments in new product launches, such as cobas 6000, Gene Sequencing GS FLX, and several
initiatives to further support and grow market share, especially in Professional Diagnostics and Diabetes Care.
Marketing and distribution as a percentage of sales increased to 24.7% from 24.0% in the comparative period.
Research and development: Costs increased by 1% in local currencies. The comparative period included
a66million Swiss francs impairment charge for intangible assets. Excluding the impairment charge, R&D growth

In 2007 the US dollar and the Japanese yen weakened against the Swiss franc, while the euro and many other
economies’ currencies appreciated against the Swiss franc. Overall there is almost no difference between sales
growth and operating profit growth expressed in Swiss francs or in local currencies. In absolute terms, the
sensitivity of Group sales to a movement in the US dollar against the Swiss franc of 0.01 Swiss francs during 2007
was approximately 144 million Swiss francs, and the corresponding sensitivities for the euro and yen were
approximately 77 million Swiss francs and 37 million Swiss francs respectively. The sensitivities of Group operating
profit were approximately 29, 37 and 15 million Swiss francs respectively.

During 2007 the Group’s treasury operations delivered a positive net financial income, with net income from
financial assets and foreign exchange management exceeding financing costs by 834 million Swiss francs. The
Group’s effective tax rate declined to 25.3% from 27.3%, despite an increased pre-tax profit contribution
from Genentech. Net income increased due to the combination of positive developments on the operating and
taxlines.

Financial income: Financial income was 1,805 million Swiss francs, declining 1% compared to 2006. Interest
income and income from debt securities were 1,001 million Swiss francs, up 28% due to higher holdings and
increases in interest rates. This result improved despite a write-down of debt securities of 68 million Swiss francs
(2006: zero). Net income from equity securities was 313 million Swiss francs compared to 390 million Swiss francs
in 2006. Funds continue to be invested with a conservative risk profile. Expected returns on pension plan assets
were 670 million Swiss francs, up 5% compared to 2006. Net foreign exchange losses were 153 million Swiss
francs compared to losses of 24 million Swiss francs in 2006, driven by losses on cash flow hedge contracts, which
suffered from strong appreciation of most currencies against the Swiss franc. A full analysis of financial income
is given in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
16 Finance Report 2007Roche Group
Financial Review
Financing costs:Financing costs were 971 million Swiss francs, basically stable compared to 2006. The increase
in interest rates had only a small impact on financing costs, as most of the outstanding debt has fixed interest
rates. Amortisation of debt discounts was 32 million Swiss francs lower, following the redemption of ‘LYONs V’
notes. The gain from favourable market value movements on the debt instruments designated as ‘fair-value-
through-profit-or-loss’ was 1 million Swiss francs, down from 51 million Swiss francs in 2006. A full analysis of
financing costs is given in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income taxes: The Group’s effective tax rate declined to 25.3% compared to the 2006 rate of 27.3%. The
increasing pre-tax profit contribution from Genentech acted to increase the overall Group tax rate. However this
was offset by a fall in the effective tax rate at Genentech to 40.0% from 41.6%. Excluding Genentech and
Chugai, the underlying effective tax rate is 15.6%, which is considerably lower than the equivalent rate in 2006
of 18.9%. This reflects the Group’s on-going efforts to optimise its tax structure, the relatively lower profits in
hightax jurisdictions and also one-time effects such as the reduction in corporate tax rates in Germany effective
2008 with a corresponding reduction in deferred tax balance sheet positions. Further information on the
Group’sincome taxes is given in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

A full consolidated cash flow statement is given on page 27of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Operating cash flows:The Group’s business operations continued to show strong cash generation of 18.5 billion
Swiss francs, driven by continued growth in EBITDA. The development of the business led to an increase in
working capital, mainly in inventories and trade receivables. Payments of income taxes were higher by 1.7 billion
Swiss francs, of which 0.7 billion Swiss francs relate to Genentech. The remaining 1.0 billion Swiss francs
represent tax payments from the increased taxable profits in 2006 and also include the payment of previously
accrued amounts relating to final settlement with the German tax authorities for a number of years up to and
including 2006. Overall cash flows from operating activities increased by 13% to 11.7 billion Swiss francs.
Investing cash flows: The largest investing cash flows in 2007 are for expenditure on property, plant and
equipment of 3.5 billion Swiss francs. Investing cash flows also include payments made for acquisitions of
2.3billion Swiss francs, driven by the 0.7 billion Swiss francs consideration for BioVeris and the 1.0 billion Swiss
francs net cash cost of Tanox. The net cash outflow from purchases and sales of marketable securities was
0.2billion Swiss francs.
Financing cash flows: Significant financing cash flows in 2007 and 2006 relate to dividend payments and
the redemption of debt instruments. Dividends paid in 2007 were 2.9 billion Swiss francs (2006: 2.2 billion
Swissfrancs) and cash used for the retirement of debt instruments was 1.9 billion Swiss francs (2006: 1.3 billion
Swiss francs). In 2007 Genentech issued commercial paper resulting in a cash inflow of 0.7 billion Swiss francs.
Following from the retirement of the ‘LYONs V’ exchangeable notes the Group further reduced its own equity
instruments holdings in 2007, realising a net cash inflow of 1.1 billion Swiss francs (2006: 1.4 billion Swiss francs).
Genentech received 0.5 billion Swiss francs from stock option exercises during 2007. At the same time Genentech
and Chugai both repurchased their own shares for a total of 1.9 billion Swiss francs.

Finance Report 2007 19Roche Group
Financial Review
Non-current assets: The fall in the US dollar to 1.13 against the Swiss franc at 31 December 2007 compared
to 1.22 at the end of 2006 decreased long-term assets in Swiss franc terms as many of the Group’s production
facilities and intangible assets are denominated in US dollars. Property, plant and equipment increased primarily
from capital expenditure on new production facilities by Roche Pharmaceuticals and Genentech. Goodwill and
intangible assets increased by 1.8 billion Swiss francs, mainly from the BioVeris and Tanox acquisitions and the
Group’s various in-licensing transactions.
Current assets: Within current assets, inventories and accounts receivable were slightly higher in local
currencies, which largely offset the decrease in cash and marketable securities as described above. The surety
bond totalling 0.9 billion Swiss francs posted by Genentech in connection with the City of Hope litigation is
nowclassified as short-term.
Debt: There was a reduction in debt by a further 1.4 billion Swiss francs following the redemption of the
750million US dollar ‘European Medium Term Notes’, the conversion of the remaining ‘LYONs V’ notes, and debt
repayments. This was partly offset by an 0.7 billion Swiss francs additional debt under the Genentech commercial
paper program.
Other non-current and current liabilities: Most of the decrease of 1.3 billion Swiss francs was due to the
reduction in income tax liabilities of 0.6 billion Swiss francs and the reduction of 0.3 billion Swiss francs in
legal provisions following settlements made in 2007. The provision of 0.9 billion Swiss francs recorded by
Genentech in connection with the City of Hope litigation is now classified as short-term.
Total net assets/equity: The most significant movements in equity were the net income of 11.4 billion
Swiss francs and the dividend payments of 2.9 billion Swiss francs. Genentech and Chugai share repurchases
reduced equity by 1.9 billion Swiss francs; however this was offset by increases in equity of 1.1 billion Swiss francs
from the sale of Roche’s own equity, together with 1.0 billion Swiss francs from equity compensation plans.
Currency translation losses were 1.9 billion Swiss francs, mainly driven by the fall in the US dollar compared to
the Group’s reporting currency the Swiss franc.
Strong financial condition: The Group remains solidly financed, with equity (including minority interests)
representing 68% of total assets and 82% of total assets financed long-term.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefit plans are classified as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions
into a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation
to pay further contributions. In 2007 expenses for the Group’s defined contribution plans were 259 million
Swissfrancs (2006: 214 million Swiss francs).
All other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’, even if the Group’s potential obligation is relatively minor
or has a relatively remote possibility of arising. The funding and asset management of the Group’s various defined
benefit plans is overseen at a corporate level. Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group
and are funded by payments from the Group and by employees, but in some cases the plan is unfunded and the
Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources.

20 Finance Report 2007Roche Group
Financial Review
Funding status: Overall the Group’s defined benefit plans continue to be adequately funded with the funding
status increasing to 114% from 106%. The main movements came from a reduction in defined benefit obligations
following an increase in discount rates in the 2007 valuations.
Expenses recorded in income statement: Pension expenses in 2007 relating to the Group’s defined benefit
plans were 312 million Swiss francs compared to 283 million Swiss francs in 2006. The increase of 9% is mainly
due to changes in discount rates adopted at the end of 2006 and increased life expectancy assumptions. Based
on the revised actuarial assumptions at the end of 2007, pension expenses for 2008 are expected to be broadly
inline with 2007.
Full details of the Group’s pensions and other post-employment benefits are given in Note 10 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Price development
The Roche securities performed broadly in line with the MSCI European Pharmaceutical Index. Both were lower
compared with their US-based counterparts, most of which benefited from higher 2007 performance versus
arelatively low 2006 baseline.

Dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing an increase of 35% in the dividend for 2007 to 4.60 Swiss francs per shareand
non-voting equity security (2006: 3.40 Swiss francs) for approval at the Annual General Meeting. This is the
21stconsecutive increase in the dividend. If the dividend proposal is approved by shareholders, dividend
payments on the shares and non-voting equity securities in issue will amount to 4.0 billion Swiss francs (2006:
2.9 billion Swiss francs), resulting in a payout ratio of 41% (2006: 38%). Based on the prices at year-end 2007,
thedividend yield on the Roche share is 2.2% (2006: 1.4%) and the yield on the non-voting equity security is 2.4%
(2006: 1.6%). Further information on the Roche securities is given on pages 112–113 of the Finance Report.

Financial risks
The Group manages its financial assets and liabilities in a conservative way. Treasury management supports the
Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics businesses and its activities should not materially affect the Group’s risk profile.
Asset allocation: Liquid funds are primarily held as a liquidity reserve. Most funds are invested in a well
diversified portfolio of high-quality fixed income securities. The prudent asset management approach is also
evidenced in the low share of equities within the portfolio of marketable securities of 1% (2006: 4%). The Group
owns additional equity securities, which are kept as part of the Group’s strategic alliance efforts. These are
classified as financial long-term assets (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Market risks: Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial
liabilities. The exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and
equity prices. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to assess the impact of market risk on its financial instruments.
VaR data indicates the value range within which a given financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set
probability as a result of movements in market prices. The VaR data in the table below indicate the loss level
overaperiod of one month which with 95% probability will not be exceeded.

At the end of 2007, the total VaR of the financial assets and liabilities was 143 million Swiss francs (2006:
161 million Swiss francs). The foreign exchange VaR increased mainly due to higher hedging levels of non-
US dollar cash flows from future royalty income over the next five years at Genentech. The lower contribution
from the interest rate component was caused by the ageing of fixed-term liabilities. Other price risk arises
mainlyfrom movements in the prices of equity securities. In 2007, the Group held equity securities with a market
value of 1.1 billion Swiss Francs (2006: 1.7 billion Swiss francs). This number includes holdings in biotechnology
companies, which were acquired in the context of licensing transactions or scientific collaborations. The lower
holdings in equity securities resulted in a lower VaR for other price risk.
Further information on financial risk management and financial risks and the VaR methodology is included in
Note32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
International Financial Reporting Standards
The Roche Group has been using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to report its consolidated
results since 1990. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has published a number of new and
revised standards and interpretations which the Group has implemented from 1 January 2007. The changes relate
mainly to disclosure items in the annual financial statements.
In addition the Group has made changes to the presentation of its operating results in the income statement. The
Group has made these presentational changes to more accurately reflect the underlying business, to further
improve comparability of its results to those of other healthcare companies and to allow readers to make a more
accurate assessment of the sustainable earnings capacity of the Group. Total operating profit is unchanged, and
the presentational changes have no effect on the non-operating results, net income and earnings per share.
Full details of the changes are given in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Supplementary
presentation materials from the investor update held on 30 November 2007 are available on the ‘Investor
Relations’ section of the Group’s website at www.roche.com.

Reference numbers indicate corresponding Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of the Roche Group have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. They have been prepared using the historical
cost convention except that, as disclosed in the accounting policies below, certain items, including derivatives
and available-for-sale investments, are shown at fair value. They were approved for issue by the Board of
Directors on 24 January 2008 and are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on
4March 2008.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of
contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. If in the future such estimates and assumptions,
which are based on management’s best judgement at the date of the financial statements, deviate from the actual
circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the year in which the
circumstances change.
Changes in accounting policies that arise from the application of new or revised standards and interpretations
are applied retrospectively, unless otherwise specified in the transitional requirements of the particular standard
or interpretation. Retrospective application requires that the results of the comparative period and the opening
balances of that period are restated as if the new accounting policy had always been applied. In some cases the
transitional requirements of the particular standard or interpretation specify that the changes are to be applied
prospectively. Prospective application requires that the new accounting policy only be applied to the results of
the current period and the comparative period is not restated. In addition comparatives have been reclassified
orextended from the previously reported results to take into account any presentational changes.
Consolidation policy
These financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, a company registered
in Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’).
The subsidiaries are those companies controlled, directly or indirectly, by Roche Holding Ltd, where control is
defined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from
its activities. This control is normally evidenced when Roche Holding Ltd owns, either directly or indirectly, more
than 50% of the voting rights or currently exercisable potential voting rights of a company’s share capital. Special
Purpose Entities are consolidated where the substance of the relationship is that the Special Purpose Entity is
controlled by the Group. Companies acquired during the year are consolidated from the date on which control
istransferred to the Group, and subsidiaries to be divested are included up to the date on which control passes
from the Group. Inter-company balances, transactions and resulting unrealised income are eliminated in full.
Investments in associated companies are accounted for by the equity method. These are companies over which
the Group exercises, or has the power to exercise, significant influence, but which it does not control. This is
normally evidenced when the Group owns 20% or more of the voting rights or currently exercisable potential
voting rights of the company. Balances and transactions with associated companies that result in unrealised
income are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associated company. Interests in joint ventures
are reported using the line-by-line proportionate consolidation method.
30 Finance Report 2007Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Segment reporting
The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the organisation units for which information is
reported to the Group’s management. The Group has two divisions, Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. Revenues
are primarily generated from the sale of prescription pharmaceutical products and diagnostic instruments,
reagents and consumables, respectively. Both divisions also derive revenue from the sale or licensing of products
or technology to third parties. Within the Pharmaceuticals Division there are three sub-divisions, Roche
Pharmaceuticals, Genentech and Chugai. The three sub-divisions have separate management and reporting
structures within the Pharmaceuticals Division and are considered separately reportable operating segments.
Certain headquarter activities are reported as ‘Corporate’. These consist of corporate headquarters, including the
Corporate Executive Committee, corporate communications, corporate human resources, corporate finance,
including treasury, taxes and pension fund management, corporate legal and corporate safety and environmental
services. Effective from 1 January 2007 the Group’s management has concluded that the remaining residual
balances from the divested Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business and the Consumer Health (OTC) business
should be considered as part of the Group’s continuing businesses and should be reported in the ‘Corporate’
segment. Prior to this these have been presented as discontinued businesses (see Note 8).
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis. Operating assets and liabilities
consist of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade receivables/payables, inventories
and other assets and liabilities, such as provisions, which can be reasonably attributed to the reported operating
segments. Non-operating assets and liabilities mainly include current and deferred income tax balances,
post-employment benefit assets/liabilities and financial assets/liabilities such as cash, marketable securities,
investments and debt.
Foreign currency translation
Most Group companies use their local currency as their functional currency. Certain Group companies use
othercurrencies (namely US dollars, Swiss francs or euros) as their functional currency where this is the currency
of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Local transactions in other currencies are
initially reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses from the settlement of
such transactions and gains and losses on translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other
currencies are included in income, except when they are qualifying cash flow hedges or arise on monetary items
that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign entity. In such cases the gains and losses
are deferred into equity.
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using functional currencies other than Swiss francs
(foreign entities) are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange. Sales, costs, expenses, net
income and cash flows are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Translation differences due
to the changes in exchange rates between the beginning and the end of the year and the difference between
net income translated at the average and year-end exchange rates are taken directly to equity. On disposal of
a foreign entity, the identified cumulative currency translation differences within equity relating to that foreign
entity are recognised in income as part of the gain or loss on divestment.
Revenues
Sales represent amounts received and receivable for goods supplied to customers after deducting trade
discounts, cash discounts and volume rebates, and exclude value added taxes and other taxes directly linked to
sales. Revenues from the sale of products are recognised upon transfer to the customer of significant risks
and rewards. Trade discounts, cash discounts and volume rebates are recorded on an accrual basis consistent
with the recognition of the related sales. Estimates of expected sales returns, charge-backs and other rebates,
including Medicaid in the United States and similar rebates in other countries, are also deducted from sales and
recorded as accrued liabilities or provisions or as a deduction from accounts receivable. Such estimates are based
on analyses of existing contractual or legislatively mandated obligations, historical trends and the Group’s
experience. Other revenues are recorded as earned or as the services are performed. Where necessary, single
transactions are split into separately identifiable components to reflect the substance of the transaction.
Conversely, two or more transactions may be considered together for revenue recognition purposes, where the
commercial effect cannot be understood without reference to the series of transactions as a whole.
Finance Report 2007 31Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and related production overheads of goods sold
and services rendered. Royalties, alliance and collaboration expenses, including all collaboration profit-sharing
arrangements are also reported as part of cost of sales. Start-up costs between validation and the achievement
of normal production capacity are expensed as incurred.
Research and development
In addition to its internal research and development activities, the Group is also party to in-licensing and similar
arrangements with its alliance partners. The Group may also acquire in-process research and development
assets, either through business combinations or through purchases of specific assets.
Internal research costs are charged against income as incurred. Internal development costs are capitalised as
intangible assets only when there is an identifiable asset that can be completed and that will generate probable
future economic benefits and when the cost of such an asset can be measured reliably. The Group does not
currently have any such internal development costs that qualify for capitalisation as intangible assets. Internal
development costs are therefore charged against income as incurred since the criteria for their recognition as
anasset are not met.
In-process research and development assets acquired either through in-licensing arrangements, business
combinations or separate purchases are capitalised as intangible assets as described below. Once available
for use, such intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the expected benefit
andare reviewed for impairment at each reporting date.
Licensing, milestone and other upfront receipts and payments
Royalty income is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the respective licensing
agreements. Certain Group companies receive from third parties upfront, milestone and other similar payments
relating to the sale or licensing of products or technology. Revenue associated with performance milestones is
recognised based on achievement of the deliverables as defined in the respective agreements. Upfront payments
and licence fees for which there are subsequent deliverables are initially reported as deferred income and are
recognised in income as earned over the period of the development collaboration or the manufacturing obligation.
Payments made by Group companies to third parties and associated companies for such items are capitalised
asintangible assets.
Accounting and reporting of transactions between Roche, Genentech and Chugai
Within the Group’s consolidated financial statements, transactions and balances between consolidated
subsidiaries, such as between Genentech, Chugai and other Roche Group subsidiaries, are eliminated on
consolidation.
Genentech and Chugai are considered separately reportable operating segments for the purposes of the Group’s
operating segment disclosures in Note 2. Additional information relating to Genentech and Chugai results is given
in Notes 3 and 4, respectively.
Profits on product sales between the Roche Pharmaceuticals, Genentech and Chugai operating segments are
recorded as part of the segment results of the operating segment making the sale. Unrealised internal profits
on inventories that have been sold by one operating segment to another but which have not yet been sold on
toexternal customers as at the balance sheet date are eliminated as a consolidation entry at a Pharmaceuticals
Division level.
Additionally the results of each operating segment may include income received from another operating segment
in respect of:
• Royalties
• Licensing, milestone and other upfront payments
• Transfers in respect of research collaborations
32 Finance Report 2007Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
These are recognised as income in the segment results of the operating segment receiving the income
consistently with the accounting policies applied to third-party transactions and set out in these financial
statements. Corresponding expenses are recorded in the other operating segment so that these eliminate at
aPharmaceuticals Division level.
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary
benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group. Where
the Group provides long-term employee benefits, the cost is accrued to match the rendering of the services
by the employees concerned. Liabilities for long-term employee benefits are discounted to take into account
thetime value of money, where material.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Most employees are covered by defined benefit and defined contribution post-employment plans sponsored by
Group companies. The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the appropriate income
statement heading within the operating results in the year to which they relate. The accounting and reporting of
defined benefit plans are based on recent actuarial valuations. The defined benefit obligations and service costs
are calculated using the projected unit credit method. This reflects service rendered by employees to the dates of
valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the
present value of benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth and long-term expected rates of return for plan
assets. Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds in the country concerned.
Past service costs are allocated over the average period until the benefits become vested. Current and past
service costs are charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results. Pension plan
administration and funding is overseen at a corporate level and any settlement gains and losses resulting from
changes in funding arrangements are reported as general and administration expenses within the Corporate
segment. The expected returns on plan assets and interest costs are charged to financial income and financing
costs, respectively. Actuarial gains and losses, which consist of differences between assumptions and actual
experiences and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recorded directly in equity. Pension assets
and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right
touse the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan. The recognition of pension assets is limited
to the total of the present value of any future refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the
plans and any cumulative unrecognised past service costs. Adjustments arising from the limit on the recognition
of assets for defined benefit plans are recorded directly in equity.
Equity compensation plans
Certain employees of the Group participate in equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Genentech
and Chugai. The fair value of all equity compensation awards granted to employees is estimated at the grant
date and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. The expense is charged to the appropriate income
statement heading within the operating results. For equity-settled plans, an increase in equity is recorded and
any subsequent cash flows from exercises of vested awards are recorded as an increase in equity. For cash-
settled plans, a liability is recorded, which is measured at fair value at each balance sheet date with any
movements in fair value being recorded to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating
results. Any subsequent cash flows from exercise of vested awards are recorded as a reduction of the liability.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction, and include all costs
directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating
in the manner intended by management. These include items such as costs of site preparation, installation and
assembly costs and professional fees. The net costs of testing whether the asset is functioning properly, including
validation costs, are also included in the initially recorded cost of construction. Interest and other borrowing costs
incurred with respect to qualifying assets are capitalised and included in the carrying value of the assets.
Finance Report 2007 33Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis, except for land, which is not depreciated.
Estimated useful lives of major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
Land improvements 40 years
Buildings 10–50 years
Machinery and equipment 5–15 years
Diagnostic instruments 3–5 years
Office equipment 3 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as
separate components. The estimated useful life of the assets is regularly reviewed and, if necessary, the future
depreciation charge is accelerated. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Leases
Where the Group is the lessee, leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all
ofthe risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the start
of the lease at fair value, or the present value of the minimum lease payments, if lower. The rental obligation, net
of finance charges, is reported within debt. Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated in accordance
with the Group’s policy on property, plant and equipment. If there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will
obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and
itsuseful life. The interest element of the lease payment is charged against income over the lease term based on
the effective interest rate method. Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not
transferred to the Group are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged
against income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where the Group is the lessor, which primarily occurs in the Diagnostics Division, assets subject to finance leases
are initially reported as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Assets subject to
operating leases are reported within property, plant and equipment. Lease income from finance leases is
subsequently recognised as earned income over the term of the lease based on the effective interest rate method.
Lease income from operating leases is recognised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The cost of acquisition is the
consideration given in exchange for control over the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the
acquired company. This consideration includes the cash paid plus the fair value at the date of exchange of assets
given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group. The cost of acquisition also
includes directly attributable costs. The acquired net assets, being the identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities, are initially recognised at fair value. Where the Group does not acquire 100% ownership of
the acquired company, minority interest is recorded as the minority’s proportion of the fair value of the acquired
net assets. Goodwill is recorded as the surplus of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value
of the acquired net assets. Any goodwill and fair value adjustments are recorded as assets and liabilities of the
acquired company in the functional currency of that company. Goodwill is not amortised, but is assessed for
possible impairment at each balance sheet date and is additionally tested annually for impairment. Goodwill may
also arise upon investments in associated companies, being the surplus of the cost of investment over the Group’s
share of the fair value of the net identifiable assets. Such goodwill is recorded within investments in associated
companies.
Intangible assets
Purchased patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Where these
assets have been acquired through a business combination, this will be the fair value allocated in the acquisition
accounting. Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis beginning from the
point when they are available for use. Estimated useful life is the lower of the legal duration and the economic
useful life. The estimated useful life of intangible assets is regularly reviewed.
34 Finance Report 2007Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
An impairment assessment is carried out when there is evidence that an asset may be impaired. In addition
intangible assets that are not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. When the recoverable
amount of an asset, being the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, is less than its carrying
amount, then the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. This reduction is reported in the income
statement as an impairment loss. Value in use is calculated using estimated cash flows, generally over a five-year
period, with extrapolating projections for subsequent years. These are discounted using an appropriate long-term
pre-tax interest rate. When an impairment loss arises, the useful life of the asset in question is reviewed and,
if necessary, the future depreciation/amortisation charge is accelerated. The impairment of financial assets is
discussed below in the ‘Financial assets’ policy.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is assessed for possible impairment at each balance sheet date and is additionally tested annually for
impairment. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units as described in Note 13. When the recoverable amount
of the cash-generating unit, being the higher of its fair value less costs to sell or its value in use, is less than
its carrying amount, then an impairment in the carrying amount is recorded. The methodology used in the
impairment testing is further described in Note 13.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods and work in process
includes raw materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs and overheads based upon the normal
capacity of production facilities. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Net realisable value
isthe estimated selling price less cost to completion and selling expenses.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts,
trade discounts, cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances. An allowance for doubtful accounts is
recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount where there is objective
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. Trade discounts, cash discounts, volume
rebates and similar allowances are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of the related
sales, using estimates based on existing contractual obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience.
Long-term accounts receivable are discounted to take into account the time value of money, where material.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and time, call and current balances with banks and similar
institutions. Such balances are only reported as cash if they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash,
are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date
ofacquisition. This definition is also used for the cash flow statement.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to
an outflow of resources that can be reasonably estimated. In particular, restructuring provisions are recognised
when the Group has a detailed formal plan that has either commenced implementation or been announced.
Provisions are recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise, taking into account foreign
currency effects arising from their translation from their functional currency into Swiss francs and the time value
of money, where material. A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be
confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.
Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Fair values
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable
and willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices or by the use of
established estimation techniques such as option pricing models and estimated discounted values of cash flows. The
fair values of financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are not materially different from their reported
carrying values unless specifically mentioned in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Finance Report 2007 35Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Financial assets
Financial assets, principally investments, including marketable securities, are classified as either ‘Fair-value-
through-profit-or-loss’, ‘Available-for-sale’, ‘Held-to-maturity’ or ‘Loans and receivables’. Fair-value-through-
profit-or-loss financial assets are either classified as held-for-trading or designated upon initial recognition.
Held-for-trading financial assets are acquired principally to generate profit from short-term fluctuations in
price. Financial assets are designated as fair-value-through-profit-or-loss if doing so results in more relevant
information by eliminating a measurement or recognition inconsistency. Held-to-maturity financial assets are
securities with a fixed maturity that the Group has the intent and ability to hold until maturity. Loans and
receivables are loans and other long-term financial assets created by the Group or acquired from the issuer in
a primary market. They are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. All other financial assets are considered to be available-for-sale.
All financial assets are initially recorded at fair value, including transaction costs, except for assets designated as
fair-value-through-profit-or-loss, which exclude transaction costs. All purchases and sales are recognised on the
settlement date. Fair-value-through-profit-or-loss financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value, with all
changes in fair value recorded as financial income in the period in which they arise. Held-to-maturity financial
assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Available-for-sale
financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value, with all unrealised changes in fair value recorded in equity
except for interest calculated using the effective interest rate method and foreign exchange components. When
the available-for-sale financial assets are sold, impaired or otherwise disposed of, the cumulative gains and losses
previously recognised in equity are included in financial income for the current period. Loans and receivables are
subsequently carried at amortised cost.
Financial assets are assessed for possible impairment at each balance sheet date. An impairment charge is
recorded where there is objective evidence of impairment, such as where the issuer is in bankruptcy, default or
other significant financial difficulty. In addition any available-for-sale equity securities that have a market value
of more than 25% below their original cost, net of any previous impairment, will be considered as impaired.
Any available-for-sale equity securities that have a market value below their original cost, net of any previous
impairment, for a sustained six-month period will also be considered as impaired. Any decreases in the market
price of less than 25% of original cost, net of any previous impairment, which are also for less than a sustained
six-month period are not by themselves considered as objective evidence of impairment. Such movements in fair
value are recorded in equity until there is objective evidence of impairment or until the asset is sold or otherwise
disposed of. For financial assets carried at amortised cost, any impairment charge is the difference between the
carrying value and the recoverable amount, calculated using estimated future cash flows discounted using
the original effective interest rate. For available-for-sale financial assets, any impairment charge is the amount
currently carried in equity for the difference between the original cost, net of any previous impairment, and the
fairvalue.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows of the assets expire or when the
Group sells or otherwise disposes of the contractual rights to the cash flows, including situations where the Group
retains the contractual rights but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to a third party.
Derivatives
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Apart from those
derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments as discussed in the ‘Hedging’ policy below,
all changes in fair value are recorded as financial income in the period in which they arise. Embedded derivatives
are recognised separately if not closely related to the host contract and where the host contract is carried
atamortised cost.
Hedging
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types. Fair value hedges are hedges
of particular risks that may change the fair value of a recognised asset or liability. Cash flow hedges are hedges
of particular risks that may change the amount or timing of future cash flows. Hedges of net investment in
a foreign entity are hedges of particular risks that may change the carrying value of the net assets of a foreign
entity.
36 Finance Report 2007Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation,
probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. If these conditions are not met,
then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged
item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship. In particular any derivatives are
reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial income.
For qualifying fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item is recorded
at its previous carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair value that are attributable to the hedged risk.
Anychanges in the fair values are reported in financial income.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of any change
in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity, and any remaining ineffective portion is reported
in financial income. If the hedging relationship is the hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment
or highly probable forecasted transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the
cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in
the initial carrying value of the asset or liability at the date of recognition. For all other qualifying cash flow hedges,
the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included
in financial income when the forecasted transaction affects net income.
For qualifying hedges of net investment in a foreign entity, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The
portion of any change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity. Any remaining ineffective
portion is recorded in financial income where the hedging instrument is a derivative and in equity in other cases.
If the entity is disposed of, then the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been
recorded in equity are reclassified to income.
Debt instruments
Debt instruments are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Subsequently they are reported at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Any discount between the
net proceeds received and the principal value due on redemption is amortised over the duration of the debt
instrument and is recognised as part of financing costs using the effective interest rate method. Certain debt
instruments may be designated as ‘fair-value-through-profit-or-loss’ where doing so results in more relevant
information as it eliminates or significantly reduces measurement or recognition inconsistencies. Such debt
instruments are reported at fair value, based on quoted prices in an active market, with movements in fair value
reported within financial income. Those debt instruments that are designated as fair-value-through-profit-or-loss
are disclosed in Note 27.
A bifurcation is carried out upon the issue of convertible debt instruments. The initial carrying value of the liability
element is calculated using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible instrument. The remainder
of the net proceeds is allocated to the equity conversion option, which is reported in equity, and to deferred
income tax liabilities. The liability element is subsequently reported at amortised cost or fair-value-through-profit-
or-loss, if so designated.
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding taxes payable
on the distribution of retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based on income, such as property and
capital taxes, are included within general and administration expenses.
Liabilities for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings,
principally relating to subsidiaries, are only recognised where it is probable that such earnings will be remitted
inthe foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred income tax assets relating
to the carry-forward of unused tax losses are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit
will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
Finance Report 2007 37Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the same
taxation authority and when there is a legally enforceable right to offset them. Deferred income taxes are
determined based on the currently enacted tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction where the Group operates.
Discontinued businesses and non-current assets held for sale
A discontinued business is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business
or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Reclassification
as a discontinued business occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held
for sale, if earlier.
A disposal group is a group of assets that are to be disposed of as a group in a single transaction, together with
the liabilities directly associated with those assets that will be transferred in the transaction. The assets and
liabilities in a disposal group are reclassified as held for sale if their value will be recovered principally through
asale rather than through continuing use. The disposal group must be available for sale in its current condition
and the sale must be highly probable.
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the measurement of all assets and liabilities in a disposal group
is updated in accordance with applicable accounting policies. Then, on initial classification as held for sale,
disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment
losseson initial classification as held for sale are included in the income statement.
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The original purchase
cost, consideration received for subsequent resale of these equity instruments and other movements are reported
as changes in equity. These instruments have been acquired primarily to meet the potential obligations to
employees that may arise in respect of certain of the Group’s equity compensation plans.
Management judgements made in applying accounting policies
The application of the Group’s accounting policies may require management to make judgements, apart from
those involving estimates, that can have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated
financial statements. Management judgement is particularly required when assessing the substance of
transactions that have a complicated structure or legal form. These include, but are not limited to, the following
areas:
Revenue recognition: The nature of the Group’s business is such that many sales transactions do not have
asimple structure. Sales agreements may consist of multiple components occurring at different times. The Group
is also party to various out-licensing agreements, which can involve upfront and milestone payments that
may occur over several years. These agreements may also involve certain future obligations. Revenue is only
recognised when, in management’s judgement, the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been
transferred and when the Group does not retain continuing managerial involvement or effective control over the
goods sold or when the obligation has been fulfilled. For some transactions this can result in cash receipts being
initially recognised as deferred income and then released to income over subsequent periods on the basis of
theperformance of the conditions specified in the agreement.
Consolidation of subsidiaries and associated companies: The Group periodically undertakes transactions
that may involve obtaining the right to control or significantly influence the operations of other companies. These
transactions include the acquisition of all or part of the equity of other companies, the purchase of certain assets
and assumption of certain liabilities and contingent liabilities of other companies, and entering into alliance
agreements with other companies. Also included are transactions involving Special Purpose Entities and similar
vehicles. In all such cases management makes an assessment as to whether the Group has the right to control
or significantly influence the other company’s operations, and based on this assessment the other company
is consolidated as a subsidiary or associated company. In making this assessment management considers the
underlying economic substance of the transaction and not only the contractual terms.
38 Finance Report 2007Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Business combinations: Where the Group acquires control of another business, the cost of the acquisition
hasto be allocated to the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business, with any residual
recorded as goodwill. This process involves management making an assessment of the fair value of these items.
Management judgement is particularly involved in the recognition and measurement of the following areas:
• Intellectual property. This may include patents, licences, trademarks and similar rights for currently marketed
products, and also the rights and scientific knowledge associated with projects that are currently in
research or development phases.
• Contingencies such as legal and environmental matters.
• The recoverability of any accumulated tax losses in the acquired company.
In all cases management makes an assessment based on the underlying economic substance of the items
concerned, and not only on the contractual terms, in order to fairly present these items at the amount for which
they could be exchanged or settled between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.
Leases:The Group is party to leasing arrangements, both as a lessee and as a lessor. The treatment of leasing
transactions in the financial statements is mainly determined by whether the lease is considered to be an
operating lease or a finance lease. In making this assessment, management looks at the substance of the lease,
as well as the legal form, and makes a judgement about whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of
ownership are transferred. Arrangements which do not take the legal form of a lease but that nevertheless convey
the right to use an asset are also covered by such assessments.
Key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
income, expenses and related disclosures. The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical
experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in accounting estimates
may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based, or as a result of
new information or more experience. Such changes are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.
The key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next twelve months
aredescribed below.
Sales allowances: The Group has provisions and accruals for expected sales returns, charge-backs and other
rebates, including Medicaid in the United States and similar rebates in other countries, which at 31 December
2007 total 812 million Swiss francs. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual or legislatively-
mandated obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience. Management believes that the total
provisions and accruals for these items are adequate, based upon currently available information. As these
deductions are based on management estimates, they may be subject to change as better information becomes
available. Such changes that arise could impact the provisions and accruals recognised in the balance sheet
infuture periods and consequently the level of sales recognised in the income statement in future periods.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill:The Group has property, plant and
equipment with a carrying value of 17,832 million Swiss francs as disclosed in Note 12. Goodwill has a carrying
value of 6,835 million Swiss francs (see Note 13) and intangible assets have a carrying value of 6,346 million Swiss
francs (see Note 14). All of these assets are reviewed annually for impairment as described above. To assess
whether any impairment exists, estimates are made of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of
the asset and its eventual disposal. Actual outcomes could vary significantly from such estimates of discounted
future cash flows. Factors such as changes in the planned use of buildings, machinery or equipment, or closure
of facilities, the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence or lower than anticipated sales for
products with capitalised rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
Finance Report 2007 39Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Pensions and other post-employment benefits:Many of the Group’s employees participate in post-employment
defined benefit plans. The calculations of the recognised assets and liabilities from such plans are based upon
statistical and actuarial calculations. In particular the present value of the defined benefit obligation is impacted
by assumptions on discount rates used to arrive at the present value of future pension liabilities, and assumptions
on future increases in salaries and benefits. Furthermore, the Group’s independent actuaries use statistically
based assumptions covering areas such as future withdrawals of participants from the plan and estimates of life
expectancy. At 31 December 2007 the present value of the Group’s defined benefit obligation is10,646 million Swiss
francs for funded plans and 3,344 million Swiss francs for unfunded plans (see Note 10). The actuarial assumptions
used may differ materially from actual results due to changes in market and economic conditions, higher or lower
withdrawal rates, longer or shorter life spans of participants, and other changes in the factors being assessed. These
differences could impact the assets or liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Legal provisions:Group companies are party to various legal proceedings and the most significant matters are
described in Note 25. Legal provisions at 31 December 2007 total 985 million Swiss francs. Additional claims could
be made which might not be covered by existing provisions or by insurance. There can be no assurance that
there will not be an increase in the scope of these matters or that any future lawsuits, claims, proceedings or
investigations will not be material. Such changes that arise could impact the provisions recognised in the balance
sheet in future periods.
Environmental provisions: The Group has provisions for environmental remediation costs, which at
31 December 2007 total 203 million Swiss francs, as disclosed in Note 25. The material components of the
environmental provisions consist of costs to fully clean and refurbish contaminated sites and to treat and contain
contamination at certain other sites. Future remediation expenses are affected by a number of uncertainties
that include, but are not limited to, the detection of previously unknown contaminated sites, the method and
extent of remediation, the percentage of waste material attributable to the Group at the remediation sites relative
to that attributable to other parties, and the financial capabilities of the other potentially responsible parties.
Management believes that the total provisions for environmental matters are adequate based upon currently
available information. However, given the inherent difficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, it cannot be
guaranteed that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued. The effect of the resolution
of environmental matters on the results of operations cannot be predicted due to uncertainty concerning
both the amount and the timing of future expenditures. Such changes that arise could impact the provisions
recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Income taxes:At 31 December 2007, the net liability for current income taxes is 1,952 million Swiss francs and the
netliability for deferred income taxes is 164 million Swiss francs, as disclosed in Note 6. Significant estimates are
required to determine the current and deferred assets and liabilities for income taxes. Some of these estimates are
based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Management believes that the estimates are reasonable
and that the recognised liabilities for income tax-related uncertainties are adequate. Various internal and external
factors may have favourable or unfavourable effects on the income tax assets and liabilities. These factors include,
but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or
regulations, future levels of research and development spending and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings.
Such changes that arise could impact the assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Changes in accounting policies
The Group adopted certain new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards and interpretations
effective 1 January 2007. A description of those changes that are material to the Group and their effect on the
consolidated financial statements is given below.
IFRS 7: ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. The new standard, which replaces the disclosure requirements
previously contained in IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’, requires additional disclosure concerning the
significance of the Group’s financial instruments, the nature and extent of risks arising from these instruments, and
the manner in which these risks are managed. The presentation requirements required by IAS 32 remain unchanged.
The disclosure requirements in IFRS 7 include qualitative and quantitative information about risk exposure arising
from financial instruments, in particular credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. The standard also requires
qualitative disclosure about management’s objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks, hence
providing an overview of the Group’s use of and exposure to financial instruments. These are given in Note 32.
40 Finance Report 2007Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
As a result of the implementation of IFRS 7, the classification of two non-current asset balances has been
changed and the balance sheet at 31 December 2006 has been restated. Total non-current assets are unchanged.
Pension reimbursement rights are now classified as post-employment benefit assets and finance lease
receivables are now classified as financial long-term assets.

Post-employment benefit assets 831 116 – 947
IFRS 8: ‘Operating Segments’. The new standard, which replaces IAS 14 ‘Segment Reporting’, requires some
changes to the methodology and format of segment reporting. The Group has determined that its reportable
operating segments under the new standard are the same as the primary business segments under the old
standard. The new standard requires additional disclosure for operating segments given in Note 2. Unrealised
internal profits on inventories that have been sold from one operating segment to another but which have not
yet been sold on to external customers at the balance sheet date are eliminated as a consolidation entry.
Previously this elimination was allocated to the originating operating segment. The segment results for 2006 have
been restated following this presentational change.

IAS 1 (revised): ‘Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures’.The revisions to IAS 1 require
additional disclosure concerning the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing capital. These are
given in Note 32.
IAS 23 (revised): ‘Borrowing Costs’. The revised standard requires that interest and other borrowing costs
incurred with respect to qualifying assets are capitalised and included in the carrying value of the assets. Under
the Group’s previous accounting policy such costs were expensed as interest costs. The Group has applied the
new standard prospectively from 1 January 2007 and borrowing costs totalling 48 million Swiss francs using a rate
of 4.79% were capitalised as property, plant and equipment in 2007 which would have been expensed under the
previous accounting policy. The comparative results for 2006 have not been restated. Had the new accounting
policy been applied in 2006, the Group would have capitalised an additional 32 million Swiss francs as property,
plant and equipment and financing costs would have been lower by this amount. This had a positive impact of
0.02 CHF on earnings per share and non-voting equity security (basic and diluted) in 2007, and would have had
a similar positive impact in 2006 if the revised standard had been applied retrospectively.
Presentation of operating results in the income statement: The income statement for the year ended
31December 2006 has been restated following the presentational changes adopted in 2007. The Group has made
these presentational changes to more accurately reflect the underlying business, to further improve comparability
of its results to those of other healthcare companies and to allow readers to make a more accurate assessment
of the sustainable earnings capacity of the Group. Total operating profit is unchanged, and the presentational
changes have no effect on the non-operating results, net income and earnings per share. These changes, which
have been applied retrospectively, are listed below.
Finance Report 2007 41Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
• Intangible assets: Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets are no longer reported as a separate
line, but are now reported as part of ‘Cost of sales’ (for intangibles relating to marketed products) or as part
of ‘Research and Development’ (for intangibles relating to technology and development, and including any
impairment on intangibles that are not yet available for use).
• Alliance and royalty expenses: All royalties, alliance and collaboration expenses, including all collaboration
profit-sharing arrangements are now reported as part of ‘Cost of sales’. Previously some of these were
included in ‘Marketing and distribution’ or ‘General and administration’ depending upon the terms of the
particular agreement. Additionally, royalty expenses payable on royalty income are now reported as
part of ‘Royalties and other operating’ income to more accurately reflect the substance of the underlying
transactions. Previously these expenses were included in ‘General and administration’.
• Phase IV and similar costs: All such costs, which only arise in the Pharmaceuticals Division, are now
reported as part of ‘Research and development’. Previously some of these costs were included in ‘Marketing
and distribution’ and ‘General and administration’ depending on their nature.

Future changes in IFRS: The Group has early adopted IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ and IAS 23 (revised)
‘Borrowing Costs’ which are required to be implemented from 1 January 2009 at the latest. The Group does not
expect that the new interpretations that will be effective from 1 January 2008 will have a significant effect on the
Group’s results and financial position. The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of the new and
revised standards that will be effective from 1 January 2009 and beyond, which include further revisions to IAS 1:
‘Presentation of Financial Statements’ and revisions to IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and
Separate Financial Statements’ and IFRS 2 ‘Share based Payment’.

Major customers
The US national wholesale distributor, AmerisourceBergen Corp., represented approximately 6 billion Swiss francs
(2006: 5 billion Swiss francs) of the Group’s revenues. Over 85% of these revenues were in the Genentech
operating segment, with the residual in the Roche Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics segments. The Group also
reported substantial revenues from the US national wholesale distributors, Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson
Corp., and in total these three customers represented approximately a quarter of the Group’s revenues, the
majority of this being at Genentech.
3. Genentech
Effective 7 September 1990 the Roche Group acquired a majority interest of approximately 60% of Genentech,
Inc., a biotechnology company in the United States. On 13 June 1999 the Group exercised its option to acquire
the remaining shares of Genentech on 30 June 1999, at which point Genentech became a 100% owned subsidiary
of the Group. On 23 July 1999, 26 October 1999 and 29 March 2000 the Group completed public offerings of
Genentech’s common stock, which reduced the Group’s majority interest to 60%. During 2004 the Group’s
ownership of Genentech decreased by 2.45% due to the conversion and redemption of the ‘LYONs IV’ US dollar
exchangeable notes. At 31 December 2007 the Group’s interest in Genentech was 55.8% (2006: 55.8%).
The common stock of Genentech is publicly traded and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the
symbol ‘DNA’. Genentech prepares financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (US GAAP). These are filed on a quarterly basis with the US Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC).
Roche’s relationship with Genentech
Genentech has entered into certain agreements with Roche, which are discussed below:
Affiliation Arrangements:As a result of the June 1999 redemption of Genentech’s Special Common Stock and
subsequent public offerings, Genentech amended their certificate of incorporation and bylaws and entered into
oramended certain affiliation arrangements with Roche. Amongst other matters these cover the following areas:
46 Finance Report 2007Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
• Roche’s rights as a shareholder.
• Roche’s rights to nominate members of Genentech’s Board of Directors.
• Certain limitations on Roche’s ability to buy or sell Genentech’s common stock.
• The process under which Roche may effect a merger of Genentech with Roche.
• The approval of the directors designated by Roche should Genentech seek to make significant business
acquisitions or divestments.
• The approval of the directors designated by Roche should Genentech seek to issue, repurchase or redeem
its capital stock.
Genentech issues additional shares of common stock in connection with its equity compensation plans, and may
issue additional shares for other purposes, which affects Roche’s percentage ownership interest. The affiliation
agreement between Roche and Genentech provides, amongst other matters, that Genentech establish a stock
repurchase programme to maintain Roche’s percentage ownership interest in Genentech.
Licensing Agreements: In July 1999 Roche and Genentech agreed an amended and restated licensing and
marketing agreement granting Roche an option to license, use and sell Genentech’s products in non-US markets.
This licensing and marketing agreement was subsequently amended to delete or add certain Genentech products
under Roche’s commercialisation and marketing rights for Canada. In addition, Roche and Genentech have a
July 1998 licensing and marketing agreement relating to anti-HER2 antibodies (Herceptin and Pertuzumab),
providing Roche with exclusive marketing rights outside of the US.
Depending on the specific circumstances and the terms of the agreement, this may result in payments on an
arm’s-length basis from Roche to Genentech, for any or all of the following matters:
• Fees to extend Roche’s option to license a product.
• Partial reimbursement of Genentech’s previously incurred development costs where Roche exercises an
option to license a product.
• Milestones and similar payments, dependent upon the achievement of agreed objectives or performance
targets.
• Royalties on Roche’s aggregate sales of that product.
Manufacturing Agreements: Genentech has agreed, in general, to manufacture for and supply to Roche its
clinical requirements at cost and its commercial requirements on a cost plus basis. Roche has the right to
manufacture Genentech’s products under certain circumstances. In July 2006, Roche and Genentech signed two
new product supply agreements. The Umbrella Manufacturing Supply Agreement (or ‘Umbrella Agreement’)
supersedes any existing product supply agreements. Under this agreement, Roche has agreed to purchase
specified amounts of Herceptin and Avastin through 2012 and, on a perpetual basis, either party may order other
collaboration products from the other, including Herceptin and Avastin after 2012. The Short-Term Supply
Agreement (or ‘Short-Term Agreement’) supplements the terms of the Umbrella Agreement. Under this
agreement, Roche has agreed to purchase specified amounts of Herceptin, Avastin and MabThera/Rituxan
through 2008.
Research Collaboration Agreement:In April 2004, Roche and Genentech entered into a research collaboration
agreement that outlines the process by which the parties may agree to conduct and share in the costs of joint
research on certain molecules. The agreement further outlines how development and commercialisation efforts
will be coordinated with respect to select molecules, including the financial provisions for a number of different
development and commercialisation scenarios undertaken by either or both parties.
Tax Sharing Agreement:Roche and Genentech have a tax sharing agreement that relates to the US state and
local tax returns in which they are consolidated or combined. Genentech calculates its tax liability or refund with
the Group for these state and local jurisdictions as if Genentech were a stand-alone entity.
Differences between IFRS and US GAAP
Due to certain consolidation entries and differences in the requirements of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and US GAAP, there are differences between Genentech’s stand-alone financial results on a US
GAAP basis and the financial results of Genentech as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS.

Translated at 1 USD = 1.20 CHF (2006: 1 USD = 1.25 CHF).
Effective 1 January 2005 the Group implemented IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ in its IFRS financial statements.
Amongst other matters, the standard requires that the fair value of all equity compensation plans awarded to
employees be estimated at grant date and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. The expense is
charged against the appropriate income statement heading. The standard also requires retrospective application,
within certain transitional requirements. In 2007 a pre-tax expense of 387 million US dollars or 465 million Swiss
francs relating to plans at Genentech has been recorded (2006: 407 million US dollars or 510 million Swiss francs).
Effective 1 January 2006 Genentech implemented US Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R –
‘Share-Based Payment’ (FAS 123R) in its US GAAP financial statements. Amongst other matters, this requires that
companies reporting under US GAAP recognise compensation expenses for such plans. Due to the different
dates of first application, measurement requirements and transitional arrangements of FAS 123R and IFRS 2,
theexpenses recorded by Genentech in its US GAAP financial statements for equity compensation plans are not
the same as the expenses recorded in the Roche Group IFRS financial statements for these same plans.
In 2005 the Group implemented IAS 38 (revised) ‘Intangible Assets’ in its IFRS financial statements. Amongst
other matters, the revised standard typically results in more intangible assets being recognised from in-licensing
arrangements and similar research and development alliances. In Genentech’s US GAAP financial statements
such expenditure would usually be recorded as research and development expenses.
There are other differences between IFRS and US GAAP, but these have a relatively minor impact.
Genentech share repurchases
On 20 April 2007 Genentech’s Board of Directors approved an extension of the existing stock repurchase
programme authorising Genentech to repurchase up to 100 million shares of Genentech’s common stock for a
total of 8 billion US dollars through 30 June 2008. Since the programme’s inception, Genentech have repurchased
approximately 75 million shares for a total of approximately 5.4 billion US dollars. During 2007 Genentech
repurchased common stock worth 1,044 million US dollars or 1,254 million Swiss francs (2006: 996 million
USdollars or 1,248 million Swiss francs).
48 Finance Report 2007Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Genentech prepaid share repurchase program: On 15 November 2007 Genentech entered into a prepaid
share repurchase arrangement with a financial institution for 300 million US dollars under which Genentech’s
shares will be purchased in the open market by the financial institution from 1 January 2008 through 26 March
2008. The prepaid amount has been recorded against equity as at 31 December 2007. For the purposes of the
Group’s consolidation, minority interests are calculated assuming that an equivalent number of shares have
been repurchased based on the amount of the prepayment and the Genentech share price at each month end.
Accordingly the Roche Group’s ownership at 31 December 2007 is estimated at 56.1% for the purposes of the
consolidation of the financial statements.
Manufacturing agreements with Lonza
Effective 8 December 2006 Genentech sold its wholly-owned subsidiary Genentech España, including the
manufacturing facility in Porriño, Spain, to Lonza Group Ltd. (‘Lonza’) for 150 million US dollars. In 2006
11millionUS dollars were received in cash and the remaining balance will be received from Lonza in a series of
payments over the following three years. As part of this agreement Genentech has entered into a short-term supply
contract with Lonza for the production of Avastin using a portion of the production capacity of the Porriño facility.

At the same time Genentech has entered into a supply agreement for the manufacture of certain Genentech
products at Lonza’s facility under construction in Singapore which is currently expected to receive US Food and
Drug Administration (‘FDA’) licensure in 2010. Genentech is committed to fund the pre-commissioning
production qualification costs at this facility and, upon FDA licensure, Genentech is committed to purchase 100%
of products successfully manufactured at the facility for a period of three years after commissioning of the facility.
The estimated total cost of these pre- and post-commissioning commitments is approximately 440 million US
dollars. Genentech has also received an exclusive option to purchase the Lonza Singapore facility during the
period from 2007 up to one year after FDA licensure for a purchase price of 290 million US dollars. Regardless of
whether the purchase option is exercised, Genentech will be obliged to make a milestone payment of 70 million
US dollars if certain performance milestones are met at the facility being constructed. For accounting purposes,
due to the nature of the supply agreement and Genentech’s involvement in the construction of the buildings,
Genentech is considered to be the owner of the assets during the construction period even though the funds
toconstruct the building shell and some infrastructure costs are paid by Lonza.
Genentech has also entered into a loan agreement with Lonza to advance up to 299 million US dollars to Lonza
for the construction of the Singapore facility, the majority of which is not expected to be advanced until 2008. The
majority of these funds will not be advanced to Lonza unless and until Lonza’s securitisation obligations for such
are mutually agreed upon by the parties. If Genentech exercises its option to purchase the facility then any
outstanding advances may be offset against the purchase price. If Genentech does not exercise its purchase
option then the advances may be offset against supply purchases.
As at 31 December 2007, construction in progress totalling 182 million Swiss francs (2006: 24 million Swiss francs)
has been capitalised and a corresponding net financing obligation totalling 155 million Swiss francs (2006: 24 mil-
lion Swiss francs) has been recorded in ‘other non-current liabilities’.

Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Leasing arrangements
In December 2004 Genentech entered into a Master Lease Agreement with Slough SSF LLC (‘Slough’) for the
development of property adjacent to Genentech’s South San Francisco site. The development includes a total of
eight buildings, which are subject to separate agreements as contemplated by the Master Lease Agreement.
Slough as the developer will construct the building shell for each building and Genentech will finish the interior
of each building as laboratory or office space, as applicable. The construction of the first buildings was completed
in 2006, at which point the lease term for those buildings was deemed to begin. Construction of the final buildings
is expected to be completed during 2008. The lease term expires twelve years from the occupation of the final
building. Genentech has two five-year renewal options for each building and has an option to purchase the
various buildings at different dates between 2016 and 2020. Genentech also has a right of first refusal with
respect to each building or the entire development should Slough consider selling part or all of the development.
As at 31 December 2007, based on the status of the development to date, the total carrying value of property,
plant and equipment from this agreement, including tenant improvements, was 275 million Swiss francs
(2006: 228 million Swiss francs) and the carrying value of the leasing obligation was 305 million Swiss francs
(2006: 219million Swiss francs). Estimates of the total future minimum lease payments anticipated by the entire
Master Lease Agreement are shown below.

4. Chugai
Effective 1 October 2002 the Roche Group and Chugai completed an alliance to create a leading research-driven
Japanese pharmaceutical company, which was formed by the merger of Chugai and Roche’s Japanese
pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Nippon Roche. The merged company, known as Chugai, is a fully consolidated
subsidiary of the Group. At 31 December 2007 the Group’s interest in Chugai was 51.5% (2006: 50.6%).
The common stock of Chugai is publicly traded and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the stock code
‘TSE:4519’. Chugai prepares financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
inJapan (JGAAP). These are filed on a quarterly basis with the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Relationship with Chugai
Chugai has entered into certain agreements with Roche, which are discussed below:
Basic Alliance Agreement: As part of the Basic Alliance Agreement signed in December 2001, Roche and
Chugai entered into certain arrangements covering the future operation and governance of Chugai. Amongst
other matters these cover the following areas:
• The structuring of the alliance.
• Roche’s rights as a shareholder.
• Roche’s rights to nominate members of Chugai’s Board of Directors.
• Certain limitations to Roche’s ability to buy or sell Chugai’s common stock.
50 Finance Report 2007Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Chugai issues additional shares of common stock in connection with its convertible debt and equity
compensation plans, and may issue additional shares for other purposes, which affects Roche’s percentage
ownership interest. The Basic Alliance Agreement provides, amongst other matters, that Chugai will guarantee
Roche’s right to maintain its shareholding percentage in Chugai at not less than 50.1%.
Licensing Agreements: Under the Japan Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in December 2001, Chugai has
exclusive rights to market Roche’s pharmaceutical products in Japan. Chugai also has first right of refusal on the
development and marketing in Japan of all development compounds advanced by Roche.
Under the Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in May 2002, Roche has the right of first refusal
on the development and marketing of Chugai’s development compounds in markets outside Japan, excluding
South Korea, if Chugai decides that it requires a partner for such activities.
Further to these agreements, Roche and Chugai have signed a series of separate agreements for certain specific
products. Depending on the specific circumstances and the terms of the agreement, this may result in payments
on an arm’s-length basis between Roche and Chugai, for any or all of the following matters:
• Upfront payments, if a right of first refusal to license a product is exercised.
• Milestone payments, dependent upon the achievement of agreed performance targets.
• Royalties on future product sales.
These specific product agreements may also cover the manufacture and supply of the respective products to meet
the other party’s clinical and/or commercial requirements on an arm’s-length basis.
Research Collaboration Agreements:Roche and Chugai have entered into research collaboration agreements
in the areas of small molecule synthetic drug research and biotechnology based drug discovery.
Differences between IFRS and JGAAP
Due to certain consolidation entries and differences in the requirements of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and JGAAP, there are differences between Chugai’s stand-alone financial results on a JGAAP
basis and the financial results of Chugai as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS.
The acquisition by Roche of a 50.1% interest in Chugai is treated as a business combination for IFRS. For JGAAP
the alliance is treated as a merger between Chugai and Nippon Roche. Therefore the JGAAP results of Chugai
do not include the goodwill and fair value adjustments that are recorded in Roche’s results, and which are
quantified in the table below. Moreover the acquisition accounting only includes Roche’s 50.1% of these fair
value adjustments and therefore the impact of these on net income needs to be added back in the minority
interest calculations in Roche’s IFRS results.
In Roche’s IFRS results, depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line
method. In Chugai’s JGAAP results the reducing balance method is used. Additionally certain income and
expenses, notably some restructuring costs, are required by JGAAP to be reported as extraordinary items.
InChugai’s JGAAP results extraordinary items are reported below the operating profit line. In Roche’s IFRS results
such items are normally included as part of operating profit and are not treated as extraordinary or exceptional
items. Restructuring costs were 12 million Swiss francs (2006: 4 million Swiss francs). There are other differences
between IFRS and JGAAP, but these have a relatively minor impact.

Dividends
The dividends distributed to third parties holding Chugai shares during 2007 totalled 91 million Swiss francs
(2006: 100 million Swiss francs) and have been recorded against minority interests (see Note 30). Dividends paid
by Chugai to Roche are eliminated on consolidation as inter-company items.
Chugai share repurchases
During 2007 Chugai repurchased 9.5 million of its common shares for a total consideration of 27.6 billion
Japanese yen (282 million Swiss francs). As a result the Group’s ownership in Chugai increased to 51.5%. There
were no share repurchases in 2006.

Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Net gains (losses) on financial liabilities at fair-value-through-profit-or-loss includes the change in the fair value
that is attributable to changes in the liabilities’ credit risk component. This is calculated by comparing the
difference between the present value of the future cash flows on the bonds, discounted by using a swap yield
curve based on LIBOR, and the market prices of the bonds. Due to a widening of the credit spread during 2007
relative to the swap yield curve, the change in fair value that is attributable to changes in the liabilities’ credit risk
component was a gain of 4 million Swiss francs (2006: zero). The cumulative change in fair value that is
attributable to the change in credit risk since the issuance of the instruments was a gain of 21 million Swiss francs
(2006: gain of 17 million Swiss francs). Interest expense on liabilities at fair-value-through-profit-or-loss was
106million Swiss francs (2006: 106 million Swiss francs).

Since the Group operates internationally, it is subject to income taxes in many different tax jurisdictions. The
Group calculates its average expected tax rate as a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in
which the Group operates. This rate changes from year to year due to changes in the mix of the Group’s taxable
income and changes in local tax rates. In 2007 the rate reduced by 2.7 percentage points compared to 2006.
This reduction is mainly the result of a relatively lower proportion of the Group’s pre-tax income arising in
tax jurisdictions with higher tax rates, together with the Group’s ongoing efforts to optimise its tax structure.
TheGroup’s effective tax rate can be reconciled to the Group’s average expected tax rate as follows:

Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry forwards only to the extent that realisation of the
related tax benefit is probable. The Group has unrecognised tax losses, including valuation allowances, as follows:

Deferred income tax liabilities have not been established for the withholding tax and other taxes that would
be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, as such amounts are currently regarded
as permanently reinvested. These unremitted earnings totalled 38.8 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2007
(2006:33.6 billion Swiss francs).

Future acquisitions
Ventana: On 22 January 2008 the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire a 100%
controlling interest in Ventana Medical Systems, Inc. (‘Ventana’), a publicly owned US company listed on the
NASDAQ under the symbol ‘VMSI’. Ventana develops, manufactures and markets instrument/reagent systems
that automate slide preparation and staining in clinical histology and drug discovery laboratories. Ventana’s
clinical systems are used in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and infectious diseases and their drug
discovery systems are used by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to accelerate the discovery of new
drug targets and to evaluate the safety of new drug compounds. Ventana is based in Tucson, Arizona. If the
transaction is completed Ventana will be reported as part of the Diagnostics operating segment. The tender offer
is for USD 89.50 per share expiring on 7 February 2008, and which is subject to, amongst other matters, the
conditions that there are validly tendered and not withdrawn, a number of common shares that, together with
the shares owned by the Group, represents a majority of the total number of common shares outstanding on a
fully-diluted basis. If completed the overall purchase consideration, excluding transaction costs, would be
approximately 3.4 billion US dollars in cash. This would be provided from the Group’s cash on hand at the time
ofclosing. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2008.
Acquisitions – 2006
There were no acquisitions of subsidiaries or associated companies during 2006.
8. Discontinued businesses
The Group completed the sale of its Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business (‘the VFC business’) to the Dutch
company DSM in 2003 and the sale of Roche Consumer Health, its global OTC (over-the-counter medicines)
business to the Bayer Group in 2004–2005. As at 31 December 2006, all business transfers had been made,
allpurchase consideration had been received and the calculations of the final amounts arising from the agreed
purchase price mechanisms had been completed and the resulting cash transfers had been made.
58 Finance Report 2007Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Accordingly, effective from 1 January 2007, the Group’s management has concluded that the remaining residual
balances from both transactions should be considered as part of the Group’s continuing businesses and should
be reported in the ‘Corporate’ segment. As at 1 January 2007 these balances consisted of provisions and other
non-current liabilities totalling 183 million Swiss francs, which primarily relate to indemnities and guarantees
in respect of litigation and environmental matters. The impact on the result of the ‘Corporate’ segment in 2007
was an income of 14 million Swiss francs relating to the release of certain accruals that were no longer required.
The 2006 results include 20 million Swiss francs of profit from discontinued businesses. This consisted of income
of 28 million Swiss francs relating to the release of certain accruals and provisions that were no longer required
less 5 million Swiss francs of expenses for the unwinding of the discounted provisions and 3 million Swiss francs
of income tax expenses. This had an impact of 0.02 CHF on earnings per share and non-voting equity security
(basic and diluted).

Other employee benefits consist mainly of life insurance schemes and certain other insurance schemes providing
medical coverage and other long-term and short-term disability benefits. The charges for employee benefits in
the operating results are included in the relevant expenditure line by function. The expected return on plan assets
and interest costs from defined benefit plans are included as part of financial income and financing costs,
respectively (see Note 5).
10. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group’s objective is to provide attractive and competitive post-employment benefits to employees, while
atthe same time ensuring that the various plans are appropriately financed and managing any potential impacts
on the Group’s long-term financial position. Most employees are covered by pension plans sponsored by Group
companies. The nature of such plans varies according to legal regulations, fiscal requirements and economic
conditions of the countries in which the employees are employed. Other post-employment benefits consist mostly
of post-retirement healthcare and life insurance schemes, principally in the United States. Post-employment
benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions into
a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation
topay further contributions. All other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’, even if the Group’s potential
obligation is relatively minor or has a relatively remote possibility of arising. Consequently most of the Group’s
post-employment benefit plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’ for the purpose of these financial
statements.
Finance Report 2007 59Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans typically consist of payments by employees and by the Group to funds administered
by third parties. Payments by the Group were 259 million Swiss francs (2006: 214 million Swiss francs). No assets
or liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet in respect of such plans, apart from regular prepayments
and accruals of the contributions withheld from employees’ wages and salaries and of the Group’s contributions.
Defined benefit plans
The Group’s major defined benefit plans are located in Switzerland, the United States, Germany, the United
Kingdom and Japan. Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by
payments from the Group and by employees. In some cases, notably for the major defined benefit plans in
Germany, the plan is unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial
resources.
Current and past service costs are charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating
results. Pension plan administration and funding is overseen at a corporate level, and any settlement gains
and losses resulting from changes in funding arrangements are reported as general and administration
expenseswithin the Corporate segment. The expected returns on plan assets and interest costs are charged to
financial income and financing costs, respectively. Actuarial gains and losses are recorded directly in equity.
The recognition of pension assets is limited to the total of the present value of any future refunds from the
plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans and any cumulative unrecognised past service costs.
Adjustments arising from the limit on the recognition of assets for defined benefit plans are recorded directly
inequity.

The funding of the Group’s various defined benefit plans is overseen at a corporate level. Qualified independent
actuaries carry out valuations on a regular basis and for major plans annually as at the balance sheet date. For
funded plans, which are usually trusts independent of the Group’s finances, the net asset/liability recognised on
the Group’s balance sheet corresponds to the over/under funding of the plan, adjusted for unrecognised past
service costs. For unfunded plans, where the Group meets the pension obligations directly from its own financial
resources, a liability for the defined benefit obligation is recorded in the Group’s balance sheet. Pension assets
and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to
use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan. Amounts recognised in the balance sheet for
post-employment benefits are predominantly non-current and are reported in non-current assets and liabilities.

Actuarial assumptions
Actuarial assumptions are unbiased and mutually compatible estimates of variables that determine the ultimate
cost of providing post-employment benefits. They are set on an annual basis by local management and actuaries
and are subject to approval by corporate management and the Group’s actuaries. Actuarial assumptions consist
of demographic assumptions on matters such as mortality and employee turnover, and financial assumptions
onmatters such as salary and benefit levels, interest rates, return on investments and costs of medical benefits.
The Group operates defined benefit plans in many countries and the actuarial assumptions vary based upon local
economic and social conditions.
Demographic assumptions: The most significant demographic assumptions relate to mortality rates. The
Group’s actuaries use mortality tables which take into account historic patterns and expected changes, such
asfurther increases in longevity. The mortality tables used for the major schemes are:
• Germany: Heubeck tables 2005G.
• Japan: National Census (No.19 Life Table).
• Switzerland: BVG 2005.
• United Kingdom: non-pensioners – PA92C25 rated down one year.
• United Kingdom: pensioners – PA92C10 rated down one year.
• United States: RP2000 projected to 2010.
Rates of employee turnover, disability and early retirement are based on historical behaviour within Group
companies.
Financial assumptions: These are based on market expectations for the period over which the obligations
aretobe settled. The ranges of assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the most significant plans, which
are in countries with stable currencies and interest rates, are shown below.

Expected rates of salary increases 3.59% 0%–7% 3.60% 2%–6%
Medical cost trend rate 9.39% 8%–10% 8.16% 7%–9%
Discount rates, which are used to calculate the discounted present value of the defined benefit obligation, are
determined with reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds, or government bonds in countries
where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. The currency and term of the bonds is consistent with
theobligation being discounted. The interest cost included in the income statement is calculated by multiplying
the discount rate by the defined benefit obligation.
Expected returns on plan assets are based on market expectations of expected returns on the assets in funded
plans over the duration of the related obligation. This takes into account the split of the plan assets between
equities, bonds, property and other investments. The calculation includes assumptions concerning expected
dividend and interest income, realised and unrealised gains on plan assets and taxes and administration costs
borne by the plan. These are based on long-term market expectations and the actual performance is continually
monitored by corporate management. Due to the long-term nature of the obligations, the assumptions used for
matters such as returns on investments may not necessarily be consistent with recent historical patterns. The
expected return on plan assets included in the income statement is calculated by multiplying the expected rate
of return by the fair value of plan assets. The difference between the expected return and the actual return in any
twelve month period is an actuarial gain/loss and is recorded directly to equity. The actual return on plan assets
was 703 million Swiss francs (2006: 1,262 million Swiss francs).
Expected rates of salary increases, which are used to calculate the defined benefit obligation and the current
service cost included in the income statement, are based on the latest expectation and historical behaviour within
Group companies.
Medical cost trend rates are used to calculate the defined benefit obligation and the current service cost included
in the income statement of post-employment medical plans. These take into account the benefits set out in the
plan terms and expected future changes in medical costs. Since the Group’s major post-employment medical
plans are for US employees, these rates are driven by developments in the United States. The effect of one
percentage point increase or decrease in the medical cost trend rate is shown below.

Based on the most recent actuarial valuations, the Group expects that employer contributions for funded plans in
2008 will be approximately 190 million Swiss francs and benefits paid for unfunded plans will be approximately
142 million Swiss francs.
Amounts recorded in equity
The actuarial gains and losses recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense were gains of
1,178million Swiss francs (2006: gains of 761 million Swiss francs). The total amount at 31 December 2007 was
accumulated gains of 1,387 million Swiss francs (2006: gains of 209 million Swiss francs).
In addition the recognition of pension assets is limited to the total of the present value of any future refunds from
the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans and the cumulative unrecognised past service costs.
Adjustments arising from this limit on asset recognition are recorded directly in equity. In 2007 this adjustment
was 422 million Swiss francs (2006: 396 million Swiss francs).
11. Employee stock options and other equity compensation benefits
The Group operates several equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Genentech and Chugai.
Effective 1 January 2005 the Group adopted IFRS 2: ‘Share-based Payment’. Amongst other matters, the standard
requires that the fair value of all equity compensation plan awards granted to employees be estimated at grant
date and recorded as an expense over the vesting period. The expense is charged against the appropriate income
statement heading.

Roche Long-Term: During 2005 the Group implemented a new global long-term incentive programme which
is available to certain directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The
programme consists of Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs), with the Group having the alternative
of granting awards under the existing Roche Option Plan.

Share option plans
Roche Option Plan:Awards under this plan give employees the right to purchase non-voting equity securities
at an exercise price specified at the grant date. The options, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have
a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years, subject to continued employment. The Group
covers such obligations by purchasing non-voting equity securities or derivatives thereon (see Note 28). With
the introduction of Roche Long-Term in 2005, the number of options granted under the Roche Option Plan was
significantly reduced, as most eligible employees now receive Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights
instead.

In April 2004 Genentech’s shareholders approved an equity incentive plan. The plans allow for the granting of
various stock options, incentive stock options and stock purchase rights to employees, directors and consultants
of Genentech. No incentive stock options and stock purchase rights have been granted under this plan to date.
The options granted, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a ten-year duration and vest on a
phased basis over four years, subject to continued employment.

– expected exit rate 12.82% 8.59% 0%
Volatility for Roche and Chugai options was determined primarily by reference to historically observed prices of
the underlying equity. Volatility for Genentech options was determined primarily by reference to the implied
volatility of Genentech’s traded options. Risk-free interest rates are derived from zero coupon swap rates at the
grant date taken from Datastream. The early exercise factor describes the ratio between the expected market
price at the exercise date and the exercise price at which early exercises can be expected, based on historically
observed behaviour. For the Chugai grants in 2007 it was assumed that all awards would be held for the full term
length, since there was insufficient historically observed early exercise behaviour.
Other equity compensation plans
Roche Connect: This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the United States and
certain other countries, to make regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting equity securities.
It is administered by independent third parties. The Group contributes to the programme, which allows the
employees to purchase non-voting equity securities at a discount (usually 20%). The administrator purchases
thenecessary non-voting equity securities directly from the market. At 31 December 2007 the administrator held
1,104 thousand non-voting equity securities (2006: 911 thousand). The programme has been operational since
1October 2002. During the year the cost of the plan was 13 million Swiss francs (2006: 11 million Swiss francs),
which was reported within the relevant expenditure line by function.
Genentech Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP): Genentech has an employee stock purchase
programme that allows employees to purchase Genentech’s common stock at 85% of the lower of market value
at the grant date or purchase date. In 2007 a total of 1.7 million shares of Genentech common stock were
purchased (2006: 1.9 million shares) resulting in a cash inflow of 134 million Swiss francs (2006: 121 million Swiss
francs). During the year the cost of the plan was 32 million Swiss francs (2006: 42 million Swiss francs), which
was reported within the relevant expenditure line by function.
Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights:With the introduction of Roche Long-Term in 2005, the Group
offers Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) to certain directors, management and employees
selected at the discretion of the Group. The S-SARs give employees the right to receive non-voting equity
securities reflecting the value of any appreciation in the market price of the non-voting equity securities between
the grant date and the exercise date. The options, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a seven-
year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years, subject to continued employment. The Group covers
such obligations by purchasing non-voting equity securities, or derivatives thereon (see Note 28).

The weighted average fair value of the options granted in 2007 was calculated using a binomial model. The inputs
to the model were consistent with those used for the Roche Option Plan 2007 awards given previously. The
resulting weighted average fair value per right is CHF 37.97, giving a total fair value of 115 million Swiss francs
which is charged over the vesting period of three years.
Roche Performance Share Plan: The Group offers future non-voting equity security awards (or, at the
discretion of the Board of Directors, their cash equivalent) to certain directors and key senior managers. The
programme was established at the beginning of 2002 and was in effect for three years. During 2004 the Board
of Directors approved a new three-year cycle of the Roche Performance Share Plan (PSP) to operate during
2005–2007. The amount of non-voting equity securities allocated will depend upon the individual’s salary level,
the achievement of performance targets linked to the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (shares and non-voting
equity securities combined) relative to the Group’s peers during the three-year period from the date of the grant,
and the discretion of the Board of Directors. These are non-tradable equity-settled awards. Each award will result
in between zero and two non-voting equity securities, depending upon the achievement of the performance
targets. Additional cycles of the PSP with similar conditions were approved to operate during 2006–2008 and
2007–2009. The terms of these awards are set out in the table below.

The weighted average fair value of the awards granted in 2007 was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation.
The input parameters to the model were the covariance matrix between Roche and the other individual companies
of the peer group based on a three-year history and a risk-free rate of 2.671%. The valuation also takes into
account the defined rank and performance structure which determines the payout of the PSP.

Roche Stock Appreciation Rights: Some employees of certain North American subsidiaries of the Group
receive Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) as part of their compensation. The SARs, which are non-tradable cash-
settled awards, may be exercised after a vesting period of between one and three years for a cash payment, based
upon the amount by which the market price of the Group’s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) at the point
ofexercise exceeds the strike price (grant price at issuance). Following the implementation of Roche Long-Term
(see above), the Group does not plan to award any further cash-settled SARs and no awards have been made
since 2004.

Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the
use of the asset and its eventual disposal. Factors such as changes in the planned use of buildings, machinery
orequipment, or closure of facilities, the presence or absence of competition and technical obsolescence could
result in shortened useful lives or impairment. Impairment charges of 5 million Swiss francs (2006: 71 million
Swiss francs) are reported as part of ‘Cost of sales’.
Leasing arrangements where the Group is the lessee
Finance leases: As at 31 December 2007 the capitalised cost of property, plant and equipment under finance
leases was 188 million Swiss francs (2006: 182 million Swiss francs) and the net book value of these assets
was66million Swiss francs (2006: 79 million Swiss francs).

There are no accumulated impairment losses in goodwill. The goodwill arising from investments in associated

Goodwill impairment testing
Pharmaceuticals Division:The division’s reportable operating segments are the cash-generating units used for
the testing of goodwill. For Genentech and Chugai, the recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs to
sell, determined with reference to the publicly quoted share prices of Genentech and Chugai shares. The goodwill
in Roche Pharmaceuticals is not significant in comparison with the Group’s total carrying amount of goodwill.
Diagnostics Division: The division’s business areas are the cash-generating units used for the testing of
goodwill. The goodwill arising from the Corange/Boehringer Mannheim acquisition is recorded and monitored
at a divisional level as it cannot be meaningfully allocated to the division’s business areas. Therefore the cash-
generating unit for this goodwill is the entire division. The recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is
based on value in use. The cash flow projections used are based on the most recent business plans approved by
management. These assume no significant changes in the organisation of the division and include management’s
latest estimates on sales volume and pricing, and production and other operating costs. These reflect past
experience and are projected over five years. The discount rate used is based on a rate of 8.9%, which is derived
from a capital asset pricing model using data from Swiss capital markets, including Swiss Federal Government
ten-year bonds and the Swiss Market Index. This is then adjusted to a pre-tax rate of 13.6%. Management believes
that any reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would not cause the carrying value of goodwill
to exceed the recoverable amount.

Internally generated intangible assets
The Group currently has no internally generated intangible assets from development as the criteria for the
recognition as an asset are not met.
Impairment of intangible assets
Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the
use of the asset and its eventual disposal. Factors such as the presence or absence of competition, technical
obsolescence or lower than anticipated sales for products with capitalised rights could result in shortened useful
lives or impairment.
2007:In the Genentech operating segment an impairment charge of 42 million Swiss francs was recorded in the
second half of 2007, which relates to a decision to terminate development of compounds with two alliance partners.
In the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment an impairment charge of 16 million Swiss francs was recorded
in the first half of 2007, which relates to a decision to terminate development of one compound with analliance
partner. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully written-down by these charges.
2006:In the second half of 2006 the Group recorded impairment charges of 184 million Swiss francs relating to
intangible assets in the Diagnostics Division. These followed the regular updating of the division’s business plans
and technology assessments in the second half of 2006, which indicated anticipated recoverable amounts that
were below the current carrying values for certain assets. These mainly concern certain of the intangible assets
recorded following the Disetronic acquisition in 2003. These assets were written down to their recoverable
amount, based on a value in use calculation using a discount rate of 10.0%. Additionally the remaining useful life
of these assets was reassessed and has been reduced from 6.3 years to 3 years, effective 31 December 2006.
Consequent to these matters, the 2007 amortisation charge for intangible assets in the Diagnostics Division was
approximately 20 million Swiss francs lower than it would otherwise have been. In the Roche Pharmaceuticals
operating segment an impairment charge of 13 million Swiss francs was recorded in the second half of 2006,
which relates to a decision to terminate development of one compound with an alliance partner. The asset
concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written-down by this charge.
Intangible assets that are not yet available for use mostly represent in-process research and development assets
in the Pharmaceuticals Division acquired either through in-licensing arrangements, business combinations or
separate purchases. As at 31 December 2007 the carrying value of such assets in the Pharmaceuticals Division
is1,501 million Swiss francs. Of this amount approximately 40% represents projects that have potential decision
Finance Report 2007 75Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
points within the next twelve months which in certain circumstances could lead to impairment. Due to the
inherent uncertainties in the research and development process, such assets are particularly at risk of impairment
if the project in question does not result in a commercialised product.
Potential commitments from alliance collaborations
The Group is party to in-licensing and similar arrangements with its alliance partners. These arrangements may
require the Group to make certain milestone or other similar payments dependent upon the achievement of
agreed objectives or performance targets as defined in the collaboration agreements.
The Group’s current estimate of future third-party commitments for such payments is set out in the table below.
These figures are not risk adjusted, meaning that they include all such potential payments that can arise assuming
all projects currently in development are successful. The timing is based on the Group’s current best estimate.
These figures do not include any potential commitments within the Group, such as may arise between the Roche
Pharmaceuticals, Genentech and Chugai businesses.

Hedge accounting
The Group’s accounting policy on hedge accounting, which is described in Note1, requires that to qualify for
hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability
ofoccurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
As described in Note 32, the Group has financial risk management policies for foreign exchange risk, interest rate
risk, market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. When deemed appropriate, certain of the above risks are managed
through the use of derivatives. While many of these transactions can be considered as hedges in economic terms,
if the required conditions are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case
the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship,
which means that any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial
income.
Finance Report 2007 79Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The Group generally limits the use of hedge accounting to certain significant transactions. Consequently as at
31December 2007 the Group has no fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investment in a foreign
entity that meet the strict requirements to qualify for hedge accounting, apart from those described below.
Genentech has hedged some of its fixed-term debt instruments with interest rate swaps. As at 31 December 2007
such instruments, which have been designated and qualify as fair value hedges, are recorded in the balance sheet
as an asset with a fair value of 7 million Swiss francs (2006: liability of 13 million Swiss francs).
Genentech has non-US dollar cash flows from future royalty income and development expenses expected over
the next one to five years. To hedge part of this foreign exchange risk Genentech enters into derivative financial
instruments such as options and forward contracts. Genentech has equity investments in various biotechnology
companies that are subject to a greater risk of market fluctuation than the stock market in general. To manage
part of this exposure Genentech enters into derivative financial instruments such as zero cost collars and forward
contracts. As at 31 December 2007 such instruments, which are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, are
recorded as assets with a fair value of 27 million Swiss francs (2006: assets of 64 million Swiss francs and liabilities
of 4 million Swiss francs). These matters are also described in Genentech’s annual report and quarterly SEC
filings.
Movements on the fair value reserve for designated cash flow hedges are included in Note 28.

Total provisions 985 203 193 824 2,205
Legal provisions
Legal provisions relate mainly to a number of major legal cases that are described below. The amounts, timing
and uncertainties of any outflows are discussed below, as are the discount rates used. The remaining legal
provisions, which account for less than 15% of the balance, consist of a number of other separate legal matters
in various Group companies. The majority of any cash outflows for these other matters are expected to occur
within the next one to three years, although these are dependent on the development of the various litigations.
These provisions are not discounted as the time value of money is not material in these matters.
Environmental provisions
Provisions for environmental matters include various separate environmental issues in a number of countries.
By their nature the amounts and timing of any outflows are difficult to predict. The estimated timings of these
cash outflows are shown in the table above. Significant provisions are discounted by between 6% and 7% where
the time value of money is material.
Restructuring provisions
These arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of business undertaken by the Group
or the manner in which business is conducted. Such provisions include only the costs necessarily entailed by
the restructuring which are not associated with the recurring activities of the Group. The timings of these cash
outflows are reasonably certain on a global basis and are shown in the table above. Significant provisions are
discounted by 3% where the time value of money is material.
Other provisions
Other provisions consist mostly of claims arising from trade, sales returns, certain employee benefit obligations
and various other provisions from Group companies that do not fit into the above categories. The timings of cash
outflows are by their nature uncertain and the best estimates are shown in the table above. Significant provisions
are discounted by between 4% and 6% where the time value of money is material.
Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees, to be affected
bypolitical, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating to environmental protection,
in the countries in which it operates. The industries in which the Group operates are also subject to other risks
of various kinds. The nature and frequency of these developments and events, not all of which are covered
byinsurance, as well as their effect on future operations and earnings, are not predictable.
The Group has entered into strategic alliances with various companies in order to gain access to potential new
products or to utilise other companies to help develop the Group’s own potential new products. Potential future
payments may become due to certain collaboration partners achieving certain milestones as defined in the
collaboration agreements. The Group’s best estimates of future commitments for such payments are given in
Note14.
Finance Report 2007 81Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Roche Pharmaceuticals legal cases
Roche Diagnostics GmbH (‘RDG’) and SmithKline Beecham (Cork) Ltd (‘SB’) were party to arbitration concerning
RDG’s termination in 1998 of the Carvedilol License Agreement of 1987, as amended in 1995, relating to the
licensing and co-marketing of carvedilol. RDG had submitted two claims for damages to two Arbitration Tribunals
in Zurich and SB had submitted a counterclaim asserting the invalidity of RDG’s termination and claiming
damages. Based on the development of the arbitration and settlement negotiations at the time, the Group
increased its existing provisions by 210 million Swiss francs in 2005. On 20 February 2007 the Group announced
that a settlement agreement had been reached with GlaxoSmithKline (‘GSK’) to settle all arbitration procedures
between the two companies relating to the licensing and co-marketing of carvedilol. As part of this agreement
the Group made a payment to GSK. The settlement had no impact on the Group’s net income as the payment
wascovered by previously recorded provisions and there were no surplus provisions released as income.
Genentech legal cases
On 10 June 2002 Genentech announced that a Los Angeles County Superior Court jury voted to award City of
Hope Medical Center (‘City of Hope’) approximately 300 million US dollars in compensatory damages based on a
finding of a breach of a 1976 agreement between Genentech and the City of Hope. On 24 June 2002 the jury voted
to award City of Hope 200 million US dollars in punitive damages in the same case. On 13 September 2002
Genentech filed a notice of appeal of the jury verdict and damages awards with the California Court of Appeal.
On 21 October 2004 the Court of Appeal affirmed the verdict and damages awards in all respects. Also, on
21 October 2004 Genentech announced that it would seek review by the California Supreme Court, which has
discretion over which cases it will review. On 24 November 2004 Genentech filed its petition for review by the
California Supreme Court and on 2 February 2005 the California Supreme Court granted this petition. The appeal
to the California Supreme Court has been fully briefed and the hearing has been set for 5 February 2008. The
amount of cash paid, if any, or the timing of such payment will depend on the decision of the California Supreme
Court, which is expected to be issued within ninety days of the hearing. A full provision, totalling 875 million Swiss
francs, has been recorded for these awards, which is reported as a current liability as resolution is expected within
one year. During the appeals process interest accrues on the total amount of the damages at a simple annual rate
of 10%. During 2007 interest of 60 million Swiss francs (2006: 63 million Swiss francs) was recorded as the time
cost of provisions within interest expenses.
On 3 October 2002 Genentech entered into an arrangement with third-party insurance companies to post a surety
bond in connection with this judgment. As part of this arrangement Genentech has pledged 788 million US dollars
in cash and investments to secure this bond. This amount, which is equivalent to 889 million Swiss francs at
31December 2007, is recorded as restricted cash within other current assets (see Note 19).
On 4 October 2004 Genentech received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice, requesting
documents related to the promotion of Rituxan. Genentech is co-operating with the associated investigation,
which, Genentech has been advised, is both civil and criminal in nature. The government has called, and may
continue to call, former and current Genentech employees to appear before a grand jury in connection with this
investigation. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
On 11 April 2003 MedImmune, Inc. (‘MedImmune’) filed a lawsuit against Genentech, the City of Hope National
Medical Center, and Celltech R&D Ltd., in the US District Court for the Central District of California, Los Angeles.
The lawsuit relates to US Patent No. 6,331,415 (‘the Cabilly patent’) that is co-owned by Genentech and the City
of Hope National Medical Center and under which MedImmune and other companies have been licensed and
are paying royalties. The lawsuit includes claims for violation of antitrust, patent and unfair competition laws.
On14January 2004 the US District Court granted summary judgement against all of MedImmune’s antitrust and
unfair competition claims. On 23 April 2004 the District Court granted a motion to dismiss all remaining claims
inthis case. On 18 October 2005 the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the judgement of the
District Court in all respects. On 9 January 2007 the US Supreme Court issued a decision reversing the Federal
Circuit’s decision and remanding the case to the lower courts for further proceedings in connection with the
patent and contract claims. On 16 August 2007 the US District Court entered a Claim Construction Order defining
several terms used in the Cabilly patent. Discovery and motion practice are ongoing and the trial of this matter
has been scheduled for 23 June 2008. No provisions have been recorded in respect of this litigation as the
outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
82 Finance Report 2007Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
On 13 May 2005 a request was filed by a third party for re-examination of the Cabilly patent. On 7 July 2005 the
US Patent and Trademark Office ordered a re-examination of this patent. On 13 September 2005 the Patent Office
issued an initial non-final Office action rejecting the claims of the patent. Genentech filed a response on
25 November 2005. A second re-examination request for this same patent was filed on 23 December 2005 by
another third party and on 23 January 2006 the Patent Office granted that re-examination request. On 6 June 2006
the two re-examinations were combined by the Patent Office into a single re-examination. On 16 August 2006 the
Patent Office issued a non-final Office action in the merged proceeding, rejecting the claims of the Cabilly patent
based on the issues raised in the two re-examination requests. Genentech filed its response on 30 October 2006.
On 16 February 2007 the Patent Office mailed a final Office action rejecting all thirty six claims of the Cabilly
patent. On 21 May 2007 Genentech responded to the final Office action and petitioned for continued
re-examination. On 31 May 2007 the Patent Office granted Genentech’s petition, withdrew the finality of the
February 2007 Office action and agreed to treat Genentech’s 21 May 2007 filing as a response to a first Office
action. The Cabilly patent, which expires in 2018, relates to methods used by Genentech and others to make
certain antibodies or antibody fragments, as well as cells and DNA used in these methods. Genentech has
licensed the Cabilly patent to other companies and derives significant royalties from these licences. The claims
of the Cabilly patent remain valid and enforceable throughout the re-examination process. No provisions have
been recorded in respect of this litigation as the outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
On 29 July 2005 a former Genentech employee, whose employment ended in April 2005, filed a non-public (Qui
Tam) complaint under seal in the United States District Court for the District of Maine against Genentech and
Biogen Idec, alleging violations of the False Claims Act and retaliatory discharge of employment. On 20 December
2005 the United States filed notice of its election to decline intervention in the lawsuit. The complaint was
subsequently unsealed and Genentech was served on 5 January 2006. Genentech filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint and on 14 December 2006 the Magistrate Judge issued a Recommended Decision on this motion,
which is subject to review by the District Court Judge. The Magistrate Judge recommended that the False Claims
Act portion of the complaint be dismissed, leaving as the only remaining claim against Genentech the plaintiff’s
retaliatory discharge claim. The plaintiff, Genentech and Biogen Idec each subsequently filed objections with the
District Court Judge concerning certain aspects of the Magistrate Judge’s Recommended Decision. On 24 July
2007 the District Court Judge affirmed the dismissal of both claims related to the False Claims Act but denied
Genentech’s motion to dismiss the plaintiff’s federal retaliatory discharge claim and granted the plaintiff’s motion
for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint asserting an additional state law employment claim. No provisions
have been recorded in respect of this litigation as the outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
On 24 March 2004 Mr Kourosh Dastgheib filed a lawsuit against Genentech in the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The lawsuit relates to Dastgheib’s claim that, based on a relationship with
Genentech in the mid-1990s, he is entitled to profits or proceeds from Genentech’s Lucentis product. On
8 November 2006 a unanimous jury ruled against Dastgheib and in favour of Genentech on all claims and final
judgement was entered in Genentech’s favour. On 30 January 2007 Dastgheib’s motion for a new trial was denied
in its entirety. Dastgheib did not appeal the judgement to the Court of Appeals and accordingly the case is closed.
Genentech’s annual report and quarterly SEC filings contain the detailed disclosures of litigation matters that are
required by US GAAP. These include further details on the above matters as well as including information on other
litigation that is not currently as significant as the matters referred to above.

market prices of the debt instruments or the present value of the future cash flows on the instrument, discounted
at a market rate of interest for instruments with similar credit status, cash flows and maturity periods.
There are no pledges on the Group’s assets in connection with debt.
Amounts due to banks and other financial institutions
These amounts are denominated in various currencies, notably in euros, and the average interest rate was 5.8%.
The average interest rate in 2006 was 6.1%, when the balance was primarily denominated in Canadian dollars,
Swiss francs, South African rand and Brazilian real. Repayment dates are up to five years and 105 million Swiss
francs (2006: 442 million Swiss francs) are due within one year.

In 2005 the Group applied the Fair Value Option on three of its outstanding debt instruments on which the Group
had been applying fair value hedge accounting in the past. These debt instruments are the ‘European Medium
Term Note programme’ Euro bonds, the ‘Chameleon’ US dollar bonds and the ‘Rodeo’ Swiss franc bonds. The
FairValue Option treatment is based on the elimination of an accounting mismatch which had been recognised
between the hedging swaps (reported at fair value) and the hedged bonds (reported at amortised cost). The
difference between the carrying value and the principal amount for these debt instruments totals 12 million
Swissfrancs (2006: 14 million Swiss francs).

Issuance of new debt instruments – 2007
Genentech commercial paper program:In October 2007 Genentech established a commercial paper program
under which it can issue up to 1 billion US dollars of unsecured commercial paper notes. Maturities under
theprogram generally vary from overnight to five weeks and cannot exceed 397 days. As at 31 December 2007
unsecured commercial paper notes with a principal amount of 600 million US dollars and an interest rate of 4.46%
were outstanding. The cash proceeds on issue were equivalent to 719 million Swiss francs. Genentech intends
touse the proceeds for general corporate purposes.
Repayments, redemptions and conversions of debt instruments – 2007
Conversion and redemption of ‘LYONs V’ US dollar exchangeable notes: On 22 June 2007 the Group
announced that it would exercise its option to call these notes for redemption on 25 July 2007 at the original issue
amount plus accrued original issue discount (‘OID’). In the period to 24 July 2007 notes with a principal amount
of 848 million US dollars were converted into 4.5 million non-voting equity securities and the remaining notes
were redeemed for cash on 25 July 2007. A total of 324 million Swiss francs were recorded to equity, which
consists of the 1,008 million Swiss francs of cash used to purchase the non-voting equity securities used in the
conversion and redemption, less the 622 million Swiss francs carrying value of the converted bonds and the
related tax effects of 62 million Swiss francs. There was no gain or loss recorded in the income statement upon
the conversion and redemption.
Redemption of European Medium Term Note programme US dollar bonds: On the due date of 2 October
2007 the Group redeemed these bonds with a principal value of 750 million US dollars at the original issue amount
plus accrued original issue discount (‘OID’). The cash outflow was 900 million Swiss francs. There was no gain or
loss recorded in the income statement upon the redemption.
Partial conversion of ‘Series 6 Chugai Pharmaceutical Unsecured Convertible Bonds’: During 2007 bonds
with a face value of 0.1 billion Japanese yen (1 million Swiss francs) were converted to shares of Chugai. The
Group’s percentage ownership of Chugai was unaffected by this conversion, as the Group has bonds convertible
into Chugai shares that mirror those that Chugai has outstanding with third parties. There was no gain or loss
recorded in the income statement upon the partial conversion.
Repayments, redemptions and conversions of debt instruments – 2006
Partial conversion of ‘LYONs V’ US dollar exchangeable notes: During 2006 notes with a carrying value of
680 million US dollars (853 million Swiss francs) were converted into 6.3 million non-voting equity securities. The
notes called for conversion during 2006 represented 58% of the number of notes outstanding at the start of the
year. A total of 354 million Swiss francs were recorded to equity, which consisted of the 1,264 million Swiss francs
of cash used to purchase the non-voting equity securities used in the conversion, less the 853 million Swiss francs
carrying value of the converted bonds and the related tax effects of 57 million Swiss francs. There was no gain
orloss recorded in the income statement upon the partial conversion.
Partial conversion of ‘Series 6 Chugai Pharmaceutical Unsecured Convertible Bonds’:During 2006 bonds
with a face value of 0.3 billion Japanese yen (3 million Swiss francs) were converted to shares of Chugai. The
Group’s percentage ownership of Chugai was unaffected by this conversion, as the Group has bonds convertible
into Chugai shares that mirror those that Chugai has outstanding with third parties. There was no gain or loss
recorded in the income statement upon the partial conversion.

Terms of outstanding convertible debt instruments
‘Series 6 Chugai Pharmaceutical Unsecured Convertible Bonds’: Each bond of JPY 1,000,000 par value
isconvertible into 1,311 shares of Chugai. Conversion is at the option of the bondholder and may be made at any
time up to 29 September 2008. The bonds will be redeemable at maturity on 30 September 2008 at the issue price.
If the bonds outstanding at 31 December 2007 were all converted it would require 55 thousand Chugai shares
to meet the obligation. The Group’s percentage ownership in Chugai would not be affected by any conversion,
asthe Group has bonds convertible into Chugai shares that mirror those that Chugai has outstanding with third
parties.

Non-voting equity securities(Genussscheine)
As of 31 December 2007, 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities have been authorised and were in issue as
in the preceding year. Under Swiss company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value, are
not part of the share capital and cannot be issued against a contribution which would be shown as an asset
in the balance sheet of Roche Holding Ltd. Each non-voting equity security confers the same rights as any of
the shares to participate in the net profit and any remaining proceeds from liquidation following repayment
of the nominal value of the shares and, if any, participation certificates. In accordance with the law and the
Articles of Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd, the Company is entitled at all times to exchange all or some of
thenon-voting equity securities into shares or participation certificates.
Dividends
On 5 March 2007 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of CHF 3.40 per share and non-voting
equity security (2006: CHF 2.50) in respect of the 2006 business year. The distribution to holders of outstanding
shares and non-voting equity securities totalled 2,930 million Swiss francs (2006: 2,152 million Swiss francs)
and has been recorded against retained earnings in 2007. The Board of Directors has proposed dividends for
the2007 business year of 4.60 Swiss francs per share and non-voting equity security. This is subject to approval
attheAnnual General Meeting on 4 March 2008.

Non-voting equity securities and Low Exercise Price Options have been mainly held for the potential conversion
obligations that may arise from the Group’s convertible debt instruments. Following from the conversion and
redemption of the ‘LYONs V’ US dollar exchangeable notes in 2007 (see Note 27), the Group reduced its holdings
in own equity instruments during the year. The Group’s potential obligations to employees for the Roche Option
Plan and Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (see Note 11) are covered by the remaining own equity
instruments, which mainly consist of call options that are exercisable at any time up to their maturity.
The net cash inflow from transactions in own equity instruments was 1,085 million Swiss francs (2006: net cash
inflow of 1,367 million Swiss francs). These mainly arose from a reduction in own equity instrument holdings
following the conversion and redemption of the ‘LYONs V’ notes.
The Group holds none of its own shares.

29. Earnings per share and non-voting equity security
Basic earnings per share and non-voting equity security
For the calculation of basic earnings per share and non-voting equity security, the number of shares and non-
voting equity securities is reduced by the weighted average number of its own non-voting equity securities held
by the Group during the period.

Diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security, the net income and weighted
average number of shares and non-voting equity securities outstanding are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive
potential shares and non-voting equity securities.
Potential dilutive effects arise from the convertible debt instruments and the employee stock option plans. If the
outstanding convertible debt instruments were to be converted then this would lead to a reduction in interest
expense and an increase in the number of shares which may have a net dilutive effect on the earnings per
share. The exercise of outstanding vested employee stock options would have a dilutive effect. The exercise
of the outstanding vested Genentech employee stock options would have a dilutive effect if the net income
of Genentech is positive. The diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security reflects the potential
impacts of these dilutive effects on the earnings per share figures.

31. Cash flow statement
Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities arise from the Group’s primary activities in the Pharmaceuticals and
Diagnostics businesses. These are calculated by the indirect method by adjusting the Group’s operating profit
for any operating income and expenses that are not cash flows (for example depreciation, amortisation and
impairment) in order to derive the cash generated from operations. This and other operating cash flows are
shown in the cash flow statement. Operating cash flows also include income taxes paid on all activities,
including,forexample, the taxes paid on the income from bond conversion and redemption.

Cash flows from investing activities
Cash flows from investing activities are principally those arising from the Group’s investments in property, plant
and equipment and intangible assets, and from the acquisition and divestment of subsidiaries, associated
companies and businesses. Cash flows connected with the Group’s portfolio of marketable securities and other
investments are also included, as are any interest and dividend payments received in respect of these securities
and investments. These cash flows indicate the Group’s net reinvestment in its operating assets and the cash
flow effects of business combinations and divestments, as well as the cash generated by the Group’s other
investments.

Cash flows from financing activities
Cash flows from financing activities are primarily the proceeds from the issue and repayment of the Group’s equity
and debt instruments. They also include interest payments and dividend payments on these instruments.
Cashflows from short-term financing, including finance leases, are also included. These cash flows indicate the
Group’s transactions with the providers of its equity and debt financing. Cash flows from short-term borrowings
are shown as a net movement, as these consist of a large number of transactions with short maturity.

recorded from Genentech leasing arrangements (see Note 3) and there was a corresponding increase in long-
term debt.
32. Risk management
Group risk management
Risk management is a fundamental element of the Group’s business practice on all levels and encompasses
different types of risks. At a group level risk management is an integral part of the business planning and
controlling processes. Material risks are monitored and regularly discussed with the Corporate Executive
Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. This overall Group risk management process
includes the performance of a risk assessment that is described in more detail in the Business Report on page66.
Financial risk management specifically is described in further detail below.
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising from its underlying operations and corporate finance
activities. The Group’s financial risk exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange rates,
interest rates and equity prices as well as the creditworthiness and the solvency of the Group’s counterparties.
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies reviewed by the boards of directors of Roche,
Genentech or Chugai as appropriate to their areas of statutory responsibility. These policies cover credit risk,
liquidity risk and market risk. The policies provide guidance on risk limits, type of authorised financial instruments
and monitoring procedures. As a general principle, the policies prohibit the use of derivative financial instruments
for speculative trading purposes. Policy implementation and day-to-day risk management are carried out by the
relevant treasury functions and regular reporting on these risks is performed by the relevant accounting and
controlling functions within Roche, Genentech and Chugai.

Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations, causing
financial losses for the Group. The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses of liquid
funds deposited with or invested in such counterparties.
The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering netting agreements
and without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements, is equal to the carrying amount
of the Group’s financial assets.
Finance Report 2007 95Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Trade receivables: These are subject to a policy of active credit risk management which focuses on the
assessment of country risk, credit availability, ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures.
The objective of the management of trade receivables is to sustain the growth and profitability of the Group
by optimising asset utilisation whilst maintaining risks at an acceptable level. Except as noted below, there
is no significant concentration of counterparty credit risk due to the Group’s large number of customers and
their wide geographical spread. Risk limits and exposures are continuously monitored by country and by the
nature of counterparties. Additionally, the Group obtains credit insurance and similar enhancements when
appropriate to protect the collection of trade receivables. As at 31 December 2007 no collateral was held for
loansand receivables (2006: none).
At 31 December 2007 the Group’s combined trade accounts receivable balance with three US national wholesale
distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corp., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp., was equivalent to 1.5 billion
Swiss francs representing 16% of the Group’s consolidated trade accounts receivable (2006: 1.5 billion Swiss
francs representing 17%).

with regard to liquidity, quality and maximum amount. As a general rule, the Group invests only in high quality
securities with adequate liquidity. Cash and short-term time deposits are subject to rules which limit the Group’s
exposure to individual financial institutions. The Group signs netting agreements under an ISDA (International
Swaps and Derivatives Association) master agreement with the respective counterparties in order to control
exposures on derivative positions.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in
time. The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its
liquidity requirements at any point in time. Group liquidity is reported to senior management on a monthly basis.
All members of the Group enjoy strong credit quality and are rated by at least one major credit rating agency. The
ratings will permit Roche, Genentech and Chugai efficient access to the international capital markets in the event
of major financing requirements. In addition, the Group has unused committed credit lines with various financial
institutions totalling 5.7 billion Swiss francs (2006: unused committed credit lines of 4.3 billion Swiss francs).

Market risk
Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities. Market risk
may affect the Group financial result and the value of Group equity.
The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to measure the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. Roche has
defined VaR limits to manage market risk. VaR data are reported on a monthly basis and indicate the value range
within which a given financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in
market prices. VaR is a statistical measure which implicitly assumes that value changes of the recent past are
indicative of value changes in the future. VaR figures do not represent actual or expected losses, or possible
worst-case losses over the stated period. Also, VaR does not consider any effects of favourable market
movements.
VaR figures are calculated using a historical simulation approach. For each scenario, all financial instruments
are fully valued and the total change in value and earnings is determined. All VaR calculations are based on
a 95% confidence level and a holding period of 20 trading days over the past 10 years. This holding period
reflectsthe time required to change the corresponding risk exposure, should this be deemed appropriate. Longer
holding periods increase the probability of higher value changes and lead to increased VaR figures.
Finance Report 2007 97Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Market risk of financial instruments in millions of CHF
31 December 2007 31 December 2006
VaR – foreign exchange component 75 35
VaR – interest rate component 40 69
VaR – other price component 93 101
Diversification (65) (44)
VaR – total market risk 143 161
At the end of 2007, the total VaR of the financial assets and liabilities was 143 million Swiss francs (2006:
161 million Swiss francs). The foreign exchange VaR increased mainly due to higher hedging levels of non-US
dollar cash flows from future royalty income over the next five years at Genentech. The lower contribution from
the interest rate component was caused by the ageing of fixed-term liabilities. Other price risk arises mainly
from movements in the prices of equity securities. In 2007, the Group held equity securities with a market
valueof1.1billion Swiss Francs (2006: 1.7 billion Swiss francs). This number includes holdings in biotechnology
companies, which were acquired in the context of licensing transactions or scientific collaborations. The lower
holdings in equity securities resulted in a lower VaR for other price risk.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates across the world and is exposed to movements in foreign currencies affecting the Group
financial result and the value of Group’s equity. Foreign exchange risk arises because the amount of local
currency paid or received for transactions denominated in foreign currencies may vary due to changes in
exchange rates (‘transaction exposures’) and because the foreign currency denominated financial statements of
the Group’s foreign subsidiaries may vary upon consolidation into the Swiss franc denominated Group Financial
Statements (‘translation exposures’).
The objective of the Group’s foreign exchange risk management activities is to preserve the economic value of its
current and future assets and to minimise the volatility of the Group’s financial result. The primary focus of the
Group’s foreign exchange risk management activities is on hedging transaction exposures arising through foreign
currency flows or monetary positions held in foreign currencies. The Group does not currently hedge translation
exposures using financial instruments.
The Group monitors transaction exposures on a daily basis. The net foreign exchange result and the
corresponding VaR parameters are reported on a monthly basis. The Group uses forward contracts, foreign
exchange options and cross-currency swaps to hedge transaction exposures. Application of these instruments
intends to continuously lock in favourable developments of foreign exchange rates, thereby reducing the
exposure to potential future movements in such rates.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could affect the Group financial result or the value
of Group equity. Changes in interest rates may cause variations in interest income and expense. In addition, they
may affect the market value of certain financial assets, liabilities and hedging instruments. The primary objective
of the Group’s interest rate management is to protect the net interest result.
Interest rate exposures and the corresponding VaR parameters are reported on a monthly basis. The Group uses
forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge its interest rate exposures. Depending on the interest rate
environment of major currencies, the Group will use these instruments to generate the appropriate mix of fixed
and floating rate exposures.
98 Finance Report 2007Roche Group
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Other price risk
Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities held by Roche, Genentech or
Chugai. In 2007, the Group held equity securities with a market value of 1.1 billion Swiss francs (2006: 1.7 billion
Swiss francs). This amount includes holdings in biotechnology companies, which were acquired in the context of
licensing transactions or scientific collaborations. Due to the nature of their business, biotechnology companies
are exposed to greater equity volatilities than general stock market fluctuations.
The Group manages the price risk through placing limits on individual and total equity investments. These
limits are defined both as a percentage of total liquid funds and as an absolute number for individual equity
investments. Equity price risk is reported as a VaR figure on a monthly basis to senior management.
Impairment of financial assets
During 2007 impairments of shares were triggered by a significant or prolonged price decline below cost value.
Impairments of debt securities were recorded due to significant financial difficulties of the issuers.

Capital
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total equity, including minority interests. The Group’s
objectives when managing capital are:
• To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide benefits
for patients and returns to investors.
• To provide an adequate return to investors based on the level of risk undertaken.
• To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver
future benefits for patients and returns to investors.
• To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
Capital is monitored on the basis of the equity ratio, which is calculated as being equity (including minority
interests) as a percentage of total assets. This is reported to senior management as part of the Group’s regular
internal management reporting. The Group’s capital and equity ratio are shown in the table below.

The Group is not subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements as known in the financial services industry.
The Group has majority shareholdings in Genentech (see Note 3) and Chugai (see Note 4). Genentech and
Chugai are both public companies and their objectives, policies and processes for managing their own capital
aredetermined by local management.

104 Finance Report 2007Report of Roche Management
Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate control over financial reporting. The internal control system was designed to provide reasonable
assurance over the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting as of
31December 2007 based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described inInternal
Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway

Finance Report 2007 105Report of the Group Auditors
Report of the Group Auditors to the Annual General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
As group auditors, we have audited the consolidated financial statements (income statement, balance sheet,
cashflow statement, statement of recognised income and expense, statement of changes in equity and notes on
pages 24 to104) of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended 31 December 2007.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Board of Directors. Our responsibility is
toexpress an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We confirm that we meet
the legal requirements concerning professional qualification and independence.
Our audit was conducted in accordance with Swiss auditing standards and with the International Standards on
Auditing (ISA), which require that an audit be planned and performed to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. We have examined on a test
basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. We have also
assessed the accounting principles used, significant estimates made and the overall consolidated financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position, the results
of operations and the cash flows in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and
comply with Swiss law.
We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

106 Finance Report 2007Report of the Group Auditors on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of the Group Auditors to the Annual General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
We have examined the Roche Group’s system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2007,
based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting as included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our examination. An entity’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process effected by the entity’s board of directors, management, and other
personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial statements prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the applicable
financial reporting framework; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection
of the unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a material effect on the
entity’s financial statements.
We conducted our examination in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000
(ISAE 3000). This standard requires that we plan and perform our examination to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material aspects. Our examination
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of
management override of controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also,
projections of any evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk
that internal control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Roche Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control, over financial
reporting as of 31 December 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Frameworkissued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with Swiss auditing standards and International Standards on Auditing (ISA),
the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended 31 December 2007 and our report
dated 24 January 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion.

The financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel, are prepared in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law.
Participations
The major participations of the company are listed in Note 35 to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Valuation methods and translation of foreign currencies
Marketable securities are reported at the lower of cost or market value. All other assets, including participations,

bearer shares with a nominal value of 1 Swiss franc each. Included in equity are 702,562,700 non-voting equity
securities (Genussscheine). They are not part of the share capital and confer no voting rights. However each non-
voting equity security (Genussschein)confers the same rights as any of the shares to participate in the available

Total 53,158 22,379
Annual Salary:The annual salary amount for Dr Humer includes the 300,000 Swiss francs that he receives in his
capacity as a member of the Board of Directors as described above.
Employer contribution to social security schemes and pension plans: The Group pays social insurance
contributions in respect of the above remuneration and pays contributions to pension and other post-employment
benefits plans for members of the Corporate Executive Committee. Owing to amendments to Switzerland’s Federal
Occupational Old Age, Survivors’ and Disability Pension Act (BVG), contributions on behalf of Dr Humer were
limited to 1,377,284 Swiss francs. Due to the existing contractual obligations with Dr Humer an additional
provision of 1,530,884 Swiss francs was recognised by the Group, which is included in the amounts shown in the
table above.
Equity Compensation Plans:Members of the Corporate Executive Committee also participate in certain equity
compensation plans as described below. The terms and vesting conditions of these awards are disclosed in
Note11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair values used in the Consolidated Financial Statements
represent the cost to the company at grant date and reflect amongst other matters the observed exercise
behaviour and exit rate for the whole population that receive them and initial simulations of any performance
conditions. For the purposes of these remuneration disclosures the fair values are calculated based on the fair
value that the employee receives taking into account the preliminary assessment of any completed performance
conditions.
During 2007 members of the Corporate Executive Committee were granted 223,797 Stock-settled Stock
Appreciation Rights (S-SARs). The individual awards relating to 2007 are shown in the table below. The fair value
of these awards for the employee is CHF 36.59 francs, which is calculated using the Black-Scholes formula,
assuming holding until maturity, and deducting 11% for the average 2 year vesting period.
Members of the Corporate Executive Committee and other members of senior management participate in the
Roche Performance Share Plan (PSP). The Group has three overlapping three-year PSPs. The target awards for
the three-year cycle are defined at the beginning of the cycle and the awards are considered to form part of the
employee’s remuneration in three equal annual amounts over the three-year cycle. Each award will result in
between zero and two non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine), depending upon the achievement of the
performance targets, and the discretion of the Board of Directors. The individual awards relating to 2007 are
shown in the table below. The number of the awards is calculated as follows:
• PSP 2005–2007: A preliminary allocation based on the actual performance for the period 2005 to 2007,
which shows two non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)per award.
• PSP 2006–2008 and PSP 2007–2009: One non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)per award.
The resulting allocations are multiplied by the non-voting equity security (Genussscheine)price at 31 December
2007 of CHF 195.60 to give the fair value for the remuneration received by the employee.

stepped down from the Corporate Executive Committee on 31 December 2005. During 2006 he assisted with
the transition to his successor and he resigned from Roche effective 31 December 2006. In 2007 he received
abonus of 390 thousand Swiss francs in respect of services rendered in 2006 and additionally received a total of
12,212 non-voting equity securities based on pro-rated Roche Performance Share Plan awards. Pensions totalling

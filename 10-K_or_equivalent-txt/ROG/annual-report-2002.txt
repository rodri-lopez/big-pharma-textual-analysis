Results on an adjusted basisLetter from the Chairman
Two very different sets of developments had a major impact
on the Group’s financial results for 2002.On the one hand,
our core Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics Divisions per-
formed strongly,posting above-market growth rates and
further increases in profitability.Gross cash flow reached a
new record high.On the other,vigorous action to address
significant unresolved issues from the past resulted in the
Group’s reporting a substantial net loss.Roche’s financial
condition nevertheless remains solid.At the Annual General
Meeting the Board of Directors will propose that the divi-
dend be increased by 12% to 1.45 Swiss francs per share and
non-voting equity security (Genussschein).

Sales and operating profitability improved significantly in the Pharmaceuticals
Division in 2002. Our oncology portfolio again showed excellent sales growth, as
did other leading Roche prescription products. Five licensing agreements were
signed in 2002 to augment the results of our own oncology programmes and will
help us to expand our global leadership in this therapeutic area in the long term.
Major milestones in 2002 were worldwide approval of Pegasys for the treatment
of hepatitis C,our regulatory filings for the HIV/AIDS drug Fuzeon and the merger
of Nippon Roche and Chugai, which substantially strengthens our position in
Japan.
Thanks to increased R&D productivity and a series of new licensing agreements,
the division was able to further expand and improve its product portfolio during
the year.

an anticoagulant, whose effects have to be monitored reg-
ularly with blood tests. Roche’s CoaguChek S, a device that
enables patients to monitor their own coagulation status,
suits Christian’s active lifestyle perfectly. It is small enough
for Christian to take it with him everywhere, and it provides
him with the reliable information that is vital to his health.

In 2002 the Diagnostics Division further extended its global market leadership.
Sales by all business areas grew ahead of the market in each of the division’s
five geographic regions.As well as gaining market share, we also increased prof-
itability.
In addition to systematic customer focus and market development, a number
of strategic initiatives to reshape and expand the division, making it not only
a supplier of diagnostic tests and systems but also a provider of actionable health
information, helped us to deliver this strong performance. Research and devel-
opment, alliances, licensing and internal venture projects are the key components
that are helping to drive this process forward.

Vitamins and Fine Chemicals
In February 2002 Roche announced its intention to divest its Vitamins and Fine
Chemicals Division in order to concentrate fully on its core pharmaceuticals and
diagnostics businesses. Six months later the Group disclosed its plans to sell the
division to DSM in the Netherlands. The contract was finalised in February 2003.
The actual closing date will then depend on how soon the authorities approve
the sale.
Although economic conditions remained difficult in 2002, the Vitamins and
Fine Chemicals Division held its market share and posted substantial volume gains.
Vitamins and Fine Chemicals 43currencies increased in the second half
of2002.Operating profit – before

and EBITDA margins were thus 6.6%
and 13.6%,respectively.Among the
factors contributing to this weaker
performance were the unfavourable
exchange rate ofthe US dollar relative
to the Swiss franc,restructuring and
other one-time costs and lower prices
for some products.
The volume ofproducts sold by the
division rose by a substantial 7%,with

Vitamins and Fine Chemicals 45Since 1994 Roche has supported the Phelophepa Health
Train, a clinic on rails that brings affordable primary health
services to people living in rural areas of South Africa.
Roche provides all operating funding for the Roche Health
Clinic, whose staff also visit area schools at each train stop
to educate people on health issues and raise public aware-
ness about specific problems.
Every year more than 40,000 people are treated on the Phelophepa
Health Train. Besides providing general medical services, dental and
eye care and psychological counselling, the Phelophepa project also
aims to help people help themselves. Volunteers from every commu-
nity visited by the train attend a basic health education course and
then act as ‘multipliers’ by passing on what they have learned to
othersin their communities.People and the Environment
Human resources, safety and environmental protection and social involvement.
Three distinct areas with a common concern: people.
Last year we introduced Roche Connect to give everyone who works at Roche
a chance to share financially in the company’s success.And we continued to
promote a corporate culture that rewards performance.
Ongoing efforts to enhance safety and environmental protection resulted in
further reductions in energy consumption and emissions of harmful pollutants,
benefiting our employees and the communities where Roche facilities are
located.
And we remained actively involved in efforts to overcome the critical lack of
healthcare that affects so many people in developing countries.

2002 has been a year of great change for the Roche Group.Significant steps
havebeen taken towards the strategic objective of creating a unique healthcare
company focused on the two high-tech pillars Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics.
The Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division is no longer considered a core activity
and is consequently being divested to the Dutch Group DSM.In October 2002
the alliance with Chugai was completed,improving Roche’s presence in the
world’s second largest pharmaceuticals market by a quantum leap.
While the underlying core businesses Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics continue
to achieve improved operating results and strong cash generation,these positive
developments have been overshadowed by three factors:an impairment charge
caused by the divestiture of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business,signifi-
cant litigation expenses and the impact of setting a new basis for the manage-
ment of the equity portfolio.For many years the active management of Roche’s
liquid funds with a long-term investor’s perspective has made a major contri-
bution to net income.Since the downturn of world equity markets in 2001
Roche has incurred substantial unrealised losses onits financial assets.These
unrealised losses have been consistently reported in Roche’s balance sheet.
Byproactively revising its accounting policies in line with expected developments
in IFRS,Roche has created renewed financial flexibility:the related one-time
impairment opens the way to manage all our liquid assets with the objective
of generating financial income,reducing debt or investing for the strategic
development of our two core businesses.
The impact of these three factors results in a reported net loss of 4.0billion
Swiss francs.Going forward Roche will be solely focused on its two successful,
profitable and cash-generating core businesses,which during 2002 generated
anet income of 3.8 billion Swiss francs.

The core pharmaceuticals and diagnostics businesses delivered good results for 2002, as is
shown in the adjusted results. Pharmaceuticals delivered particularly strong results in the oncology
and transplantation areas and in addition generic competition to Roaccutane/Accutane in
theUnited States came later than expected. The 2002 results also include three months worth of
results from Chugai. Diagnostics once again showed continued growth in all business areas,
especially diabetes care.
The financial impacts of the repositioning of the Roche Group as well as certain litigation matters
have had a huge impact on the reported results. Litigation costs for the vitamin case and Genentech
legal cases totalled 2.5 billion Swiss francs. The book value of the net assets of the Vitamins and Fine
Chemicals Division has been written-down by 1.65 billion Swiss francs based on the sales price
agreed with DSM, although this is partly offset by a book gain of 0.6 billion Swiss francs on the part
disposal of Nippon Roche. The single largest impact has been in respect of the financial assets.
Here the falls in world markets over the last two years, and particularly in the last six months of 2002,
resulted in net unrealised losses of over 5 billion Swiss francs on the Group’s equity portfolio. Con-
sistent with the on-going restructuring of the Group’s financing and treasury operations, the Group
has decided to proactively revise its accounting policy in line with US healthcare peers and expected
developments in IFRS to give a more appropriate presentation in the financial statements. Following
this accounting policy revision, the major part of previously unrealised losses that had been deferred
in equity were written-off. This resulted in a one-time expense of 5.2 billion Swiss francs.
During 2002 we have made positive and sometimes
painful progress towards repositioning the Roche
Group.We are exiting non-core activities and are
now fully focused on our successful pharmaceuticals
and diagnostics businesses. Roche Finance is now
providing a solid platform for value creation and an
entrepreneurial development of our Group.

Financial Review 57Roche Group repositioning in millions of CHF
Chugai
The alliance with Chugai has been completed during 2002, and the Group is now well positioned
to move forward with its strategic objectives in Japan. The final purchase consideration in the
acquisition accounting was 2.7 billion Swiss francs, although the overall consolidated net cash
outflow was only 0.5 billion Swiss francs as the cash contributions made to Chugai remain on the
Group’s consolidated balance sheet. The annual on-going effects of the acquisition accounting
include 80 million Swiss francs of amortisation and 10 million Swiss francs of depreciation.
The acquisition accounting also resulted in a one-time net gain of 586 million Swiss francs from
effectively selling 49.9% of Nippon Roche to the minority shareholders of Chugai and a fair value
write-up of 136 million Swiss francs on inventories held by Chugai at the date of acquisition. This
will be written-off over the inventory turn of 4.8 months from October 2002, resulting in additional
expenses of 87 million Swiss francs in 2002 and 49 million Swiss francs in the first half of 2003.
Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring
The fundamental restructuring programme announced on 30 May 2001 has been largely com-
pleted. Additional costs during 2002 were 154 million Swiss francs. No future costs are
anticipated. The restructuring has lead to a more optimal cost structure and more focussed sales
spend.
Divestment of Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business
The sale of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business has now been completed, subject to regu-
latory approval, and is expected to close by the first half of 2003. Based on the signed agreement
with DSM, an impairment of the net assets of the division totalling 1,650 million Swiss francs
hasbeen recorded. Reduced profitability in the business since the initial announcement of the
preliminary agreement with DSM and the reductions in the market valuations of businesses
worldwide have led to the agreed sales price of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business being
significantly lower than its previous book value. This reduction drives the impairment charge.
As part of the sale agreement, the liabilities in respect of the vitamin case remain with the Roche
Group. Additional expenses were recorded in 2002 of 1,770 million Swiss francs, which represents
the resolution of all major litigation currently outstanding from US customers and an estimate of
the remaining likely litigation costs worldwide.
Genentech legal cases
Following a court judgement, the Group’s US subsidiary Genentech recorded a provision of
778million Swiss francs. The main litigation concerned relates to an alleged breach of a 1976
agreement between Genentech and the City of Hope Medical Center. Genentech is appealing
thejudgement. However, as was already announced in the Group’s half-year results, a full
provision has been recorded in the financial statements.
58 Financial ReviewTreasury and Financing
During 2002 the Group took further steps to restructure its treasury and financing operations.
Thestrategic objective is to move from high risk taking to having financial investments in line
with the Group’s healthcare peers. At the same time, the Group is evaluating options to restruc-
ture its debt financing with the aim of further reducing debt levels, simplifying the funding
structure and better aligning funding levels with operating needs.
Developments in world markets have reduced the fair value of the Group’s equity portfolio and
have resulted in large unrealised losses deferred in equity. Consistent with the strategic objec-
tives, Roche decided to proactively revise its accounting policy for available-for-sale financial
assets. In future any investments that have a market value of more than 25% below their original
cost for a sustained six-month period will be considered as impaired and the loss will automati-
cally be recorded in the income statement rather than being deferred in equity. The one-time
impact of this revision of the accounting policy is to recognise unrealised losses of 5.2 billion Swiss
francs as at 31 December 2002 as an impairment charge. In effect these amounts are reclassified
from fair value reserves in equity to retained earnings via the income statement. There is no
impact on the balance sheet value of the financial assets, as these have already been recorded
atmarket value since 1 January 2001.

2002 increased adjusted Group sales by 9% in local currencies to 26,545 million Swiss francs.
Chugai contributed slightly less than 3 percentage points to the Group’s growth and 4 percentage
points to the growth of Pharmaceuticals and of the total prescription business. This significant
sales increase was achieved in spite of the adverse impacts of generics on Roaccutane/Accutane,
in particular in the second half of 2002.

Operating profit increased by 22% in local currencies (12% in Swiss francs) to almost 5 billion
Swiss francs on an adjusted basis, which excludes the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business and
other special items in both 2002 and 2001. The increase was primarily driven by the sales growth,
an improved cost structure as a result of the Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring and gains of
approximately 250 million Swiss francs from continuing product portfolio and asset realignments.
Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics both increased their operating profit margin to 21.1% and 15.6%
respectively. The Group operating profit margin was 18.7% of sales, an increase of 1.5 percentage
points over the previous year.
Gross profit: Increase of 10% (3% in Swiss francs) to 20.4 billion Swiss francs, with the gross
profit margin improved by 0.3 percentage points to 77.0%. This reflects particularly strong growth
in high-margin Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics products and the effects of continuing produc-
tivity improvements.
Marketing and distribution: Increase of 8% (1% in Swiss francs) to 8.1 billion Swiss francs,
which was under-proportional to sales growth. Cost increases for the Pegasys and Fuzeon
product launches in 2003 were partially offset by a more focused spend on growth areas resulting
from the restructuring. Marketing and distribution as a percentage of sales fell by 0.5 percentage
points.
Research and development: Increase of 15% (10% in Swiss francs) to 4.1 billion Swiss francs to
support the strong research and development pipelines of the core businesses and intensified
in-licensing arrangements. Research and development costs as a percentage of sales on Group
level reached 15.6% in 2002, an increase of 1 percentage point over 2001. For Pharmaceuticals,
which accounts for more than 80% of the Group’s research and development expenses, they
increased from 16.5% to 17.9%.
Administration: Increase of 12% (7% in Swiss francs) to 1.2 billion Swiss francs, mainly due to
the integration of Chugai and other corporate projects.
Financial Review 61Amortisation of intangible assets: Increase of 5% (decrease of 2% in Swiss francs) to 1.5 bil-
lion Swiss francs. In local currencies the amortisation charge increased by 5% mainly due to the
acquisition of Chugai on 1 October 2002. The fall in Swiss francs is mainly driven by foreign
exchange movements as a significant part of the Group’s intangible assets are denominated in
US dollars, euros and Japanese Yen. Roche’s amortisation charge, currently almost 6% of sales,
continues to be significantly higher than the industry average. Following the implementation
ofrecent changes companies using United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(USGAAP) are no longer required to amortise goodwill and instead must carry out a regular
impairment review. Roche is continuing to amortise goodwill, including that held by Genentech,
as required by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), with a goodwill amortisation
expense of501 million Swiss francs.
Other operating income (expense), net: Decrease of 36% (40% in Swiss francs) to net
expense of 514 million Swiss francs, after 852 million Swiss francs in 2001. This reduction in the
net expense is mainly driven by gains of approximately 250 million Swiss francs from continuing
product portfolio and asset realignments, in particular by the gain from the disposal of Neupogen
of 217million Swiss francs in the second half of 2002.

62 Financial ReviewPharmaceuticals: Operating profit and EBITDA margins improved further
Operating profit increased by 11% to 4.1 billion Swiss francs, representing 21.1% of sales in 2002
after 19.5% in 2001. EBITDA totalled 6.0 billion Swiss francs, up by 7%, and the EBITDA margin
increased from 29.7% to 31.0%. This strong result is driven by the prescription business while the
OTC results weakened compared to the previous year.
Total prescription sales increased by 10% in local currencies primarily driven by the strong
performance of the oncology franchise and other key products such as CellCept and NeoRecormon,
partly offset by the impact of generics on Roaccutane/Accutane. The consolidation of Chugai
from 1 October 2002 contributed 4 percentage points to the growth of the prescription business.
Marketing and distribution costs increased in line with sales. Increased costs for the launch of
new products such as Pegasys and Fuzeon were partially offset by a more focused spend on
growth areas resulting from the Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring. The research and devel-
opment pipeline was complemented by a number of in-licensing deals, which increased R&D
costs substantially due to upfront and milestone payments. The result also includes the gain on
the disposal of Neupogen of 217 million Swiss francs.
Due to the acquisition of Chugai and in order to improve comparability, the Japan prescription
business is now reported separately. It consists of the Nippon Roche prescription business until
30 September 2002 and Chugai from 1 October 2002. Consequently the Roche prescription
business as shown in this report excludes the business in Japan for both years. The profitability
of the Roche prescription business was improved further and the operating profit margin is now
at 25.0%. The Genentech prescription business achieved another very strong sales and profit
growth. The EBITDA margin of 37.0% represents Genentech’s strong contribution to the Group’s
operating cash generation. The 2002 operating profit of Genentech includes 603 million Swiss
francs of amortisation mainly arising from the acquisition of Genentech by Roche. The Japan
prescription business grew by 63% as a result of the acquisition of Chugai. The operating profit
margin decreased to 14.4% due to the strength of the Swiss franc relative to the Japanese yen,
higher launch costsfor new products and the recurring acquisition accounting charges. On an
annualised basis these acquisition accounting impacts amount to approximately 90 million Swiss
francs.
OTC sales fell by 2% in local currencies. The main factors were weak sales of Aleve and the eco-
nomic difficulties in Latin America. Operating profit decreased by 14% to 244 million Swiss francs,
primarily due to the decline in sales, start-up costs for a new production facility, the absence of
second half 2001 gains on product disposals as part of the ongoing product portfolio streamlining
and intensified marketing efforts for product roll-outs in the second half of 2002. The operating
profit margin was 15.7% compared to 17.2% in 2001.
Diagnostics: another strong result
The sales development again significantly outperformed the market with an overall growth rate
of11% in local currencies. Sales growth in the high margin business areas Molecular Diagnostics
and Diabetes Care was particularly strong. Operating profit increased by 14% to 1,131 million
Swiss francs and EBITDA by 8% to 1,984 million Swiss francs. Profitability again improved with the
operating profit margin up by 1.2 percentage points to 15.6% and the EBITDA margin up by
0.8percentage points to 27.4%. Increased operating costs, in particular for research and develop-
ment and licensing activities, were more than offset by the strong sales growth.
Other
The result of ‘Other’ consists of the costs of Corporate Headquarters. In 2002, costs increased
compared to 2001 mainly due to the launch of corporate initiatives.
Financial Review 63Financial income (expense), net in millions of CHF
Impairment of financial assets
The impairment charge of 5,192 million Swiss francs has a very major impact on the Group’s
results. This charge arises from the accumulated effects on the Group’s equity portfolio of the
falls in world markets over the last two years, and especially in the last six months. The Group’s
revised accounting policy means that further significant falls would automatically be recognised
as expenses, and not accumulate as deferrals in equity.
Underlying net financial income
Net financial income on an adjusted basis decreased by 52% to 736 million Swiss francs. This
excludes net financial expenses of 73 million Swiss francs attributable to the Vitamins and Fine
Chemicals business. The most significant item is a further gain of 1,032 million Swiss francs on
disposal of LabCorp shares. Gains on equity derivatives include a further 167 million Swiss francs
in respect of locking in part of the LabCorp gains using derivatives.
Excluding LabCorp, adjusted financial income is a net expense of 463 million Swiss francs, which
is broadly as expected. Net income from equity investments excluding LabCorp was 314 million
Swiss francs. The difficult market environment has limited the possibilities to realise other gains.
Interest income was 487 million Swiss francs, a decrease of 26% relative to the prior year caused
by falls in interest rates. Interest expense fell by 10% to 1,355 million Swiss francs. The fall in
interest rates had less impact here, as the amortisation rates on the discount on debt instruments
are fixed. A full breakdown of net financial income is given in Note 12 to the financial statements.
Income taxesin millions of CHF
The major events in 2002 have uneven tax impacts, which result in a tax expense of 839 million
Swiss francs on a pre-tax loss of 3,194 million Swiss francs. These impacts are shown in the table
in Note 13. The most significant is the impairment of financial assets, which causes a pre-tax
lossof 5.2 billion Swiss francs with little tax impact, as most of the investments are held in low-tax
jurisdictions.
On an adjusted basis the effective tax rate has increased to 29% from 23% in 2001. This is mainly
due to operating income making up an increasingly higher proportion of pre-tax income than has
previously been the case. Also the increasingly positive impact of Genentech and Chugai on
pre-tax profits results in an increasing tax rate. Consequently, although adjusted pre-tax income
in2002 is 4% lower than in 2001, the tax expense is 21% higher.
Associated companies and minority interests in millions of CHF
In the reported results, part of the costs of the Genentech legal cases is attributable to the
minorities. The underlying expense from minority interest continues to increase, as the overall
contribution of Genentech to net income increases. In the comparative results, income from asso-
ciated companies consists mainly of the income from LabCorp for the period prior to June 2001,
during which time it was accounted for as an associated company. The remaining associated
companies, notably Basilea Pharmaceutica, are currently generating a net expense.

On a reported basis the various major events in 2002 result in a net loss of 4,026 million Swiss
francs. On an adjusted basis net income is 17% lower at 3,808 million Swiss francs, with the 12%
increase in operating profit being offset by lower financial income and a proportionately higher
tax charge.

Increase (decrease) in cash 294 574
The Group’s operations continued to show strong growing operating cash generation of 8.6 billion
Swiss francs, driven by continued growth in EBITDA. The operating cash surplus was largely
absorbed by payments totalling 4.3 billion Swiss francs in respect of major legal cases. These
payments were as follows:
– Vitamin case – EU fine (778 million Swiss francs)
– Vitamin case – various settlement payments made to direct and indirect vitamins customers in
the United States and elsewhere (2,488 million Swiss francs)
– Igen litigation – payment of 1,018 million Swiss francs into a collateral deposit account pending
the resolution of the litigation.
Other operating cash flows have increased due to the additional contribution of 530 million Swiss
francs paid into one of the Group’s US pension plans. The increase in taxes paid reflects settle-
ment of the increased tax expenses noted during 2001, and includes taxes paid on the LabCorp
gains.
The most significant financing cash flows were the payment of the dividend to shareholders
(1.1billion Swiss francs) and the repayment on its due date of the 100 billion yen ‘Samurai’ bonds
with a cash outflow of 1.3 billion Swiss francs. The outflows also include 1.1 billion Swiss francs
cash paid by Genentech to repurchase their own shares from third parties.
Investing cash flows include the impacts of the Chugai and Antisoma alliances as well as 1.3 bil-
lion Swiss franc proceeds from the sale of LabCorp shares in March and July. Capital expenditure
was slightly increased and there were no other major acquisitions or divestments. Funds for
themajor cash outflows described above were taken from the Group’s marketable securities
portfolio, which accounts for the remainder of the inflow during the year.
The demerger of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division will not be completed until the first
half of 2003, and therefore the division’s cash flows are still included in the above figures.

Net liquidity 600 5,878
Net liquidity has decreased by 5.3 billion Swiss francs to give 600 million Swiss francs. Significant
outflows were as follows:
– The vitamin case payments – 3.3 billion Swiss francs
– The dividend payment – 1.1 billion Swiss francs
– Falls in fair value of marketable securities – 3.2 billion Swiss francs.
The large outflows were partly off-set by cash generated from operations, where EBITDA totalled
6.0 billion Swiss francs. Three of the Group’s debt instruments, the ‘LYONs II’, ‘Helveticus’ and
‘Bullet’ bonds, totalling 3.3 billion Swiss francs, are now classified as repayable within one year.
The sale of LabCorp shares has no effect on net liquidity, as in simple terms, it is a transfer
frommarketable securities to cash. Similarly the repayment of the ‘Samurai’ bonds is, in effect,
areduction of both short-term debt and cash by 1.3 billion Swiss francs.
For 2003, certain major items are foreseeable, including the proceeds from the demerger of the
Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division, settlement of remaining vitamin case provisions and the
proposed dividend payment. The repayment of the ‘LYONs II’, ‘Helveticus’ and ‘Bullet’ debt instru-
ments will reduce cash, but will not affect net liquidity as debt is also reduced.

66 Financial ReviewForeign currency translation effects: The fall in the value of the US dollar relative to the Swiss
franc had a significant impact on certain balance sheet headings, particularly intangible assets,
long-term debt and minority interests, which all have a relatively high proportion of US dollar
denominated items. The effects from the movements in the euro and Japanese yen relative to
theSwiss franc had a less significant impact.
Chugai: The completion of the alliance with Chugai on 1 October 2002 has a significant impact
on the balance sheet. Net acquired assets, including fair value adjustments, were 3.6 billion Swiss
francs, of which 1.4 billion Swiss francs is attributable to minorities. The part disposal of Nippon
Roche further increased minority interests by 149 million Swiss francs.
Provisions and litigation: The vitamin case related payments totalled 3.3 billion Swiss francs,
which reduces current liabilities. This was partly offset by the 1.8 billion Swiss franc increase in
the provision booked in the second half of 2002. All remaining provisions in respect of the vitamin
case are now classified as short-term. The Igen litigation related payment of 1,018 million Swiss
francs into a collateral deposit account reduces current assets and increases long-term assets.
The provision for Genentech legal cases of 778 million Swiss francs is included in non-current lia-
bilities. Long-term assets are increased and current assets decreased by 874 million Swiss francs
following the reclassification of certain of Genentech’s investments as long-term (see Note 9).
Equity and financing: The repayment of the ‘Samurai’ bonds reduced current liabilities by
1.3billion Swiss francs. The ‘LYONs II’, ‘Helveticus’ and ‘Bullet’ bonds, with a book value of 3.3 bil-
lion Swiss francs, are now shown as current liabilities. The payment of the dividend reduced
equity by 1.1 billion Swiss francs and the net loss for the period further decreases equity. The sale
of the LabCorp shares means that the unrealised gain that had been held within equity was
takenout of equity and recognised in the income statement. The impairment on financial assets
has no overall impact on total equity, in effect it has been transferred from the fair value reserves
to retained earnings via the income statement. The Group’s obligation to repurchase own equity
instruments in connection with the ‘Sumo’ and ‘LYONs V’ has been reclassified from equity to
long-term debt at its discounted value of 2.4 billion Swiss francs. The effects of currency trans-
lation reduced net assets and equity by 1.7 billion Swiss francs.
Other movements: Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets decreased by 3.7 billion
Swiss francs, due to the 1,650 million Swiss franc impairment charge for the Vitamins and Fine
Chemicals Division, and due to depreciation and amortisation and the fall in the US dollar. Minor-
ity interests were stable as the increase in respect of Chugai largely offsets the decreases result-
ing from the share repurchases by Genentech and the fall in the US dollar.
Strong financial condition: The Group remains solidly financed, however recent events have
had a significant impact, with equity (including minority interests) representing 40% of total
assets compared to 45% at the end of 2001. In spite of this, 76% of total assets are still financed
long-term. Net liquidity has reduced by 5.3 billion Swiss francs during 2002.
Financial Review 67Subsequent events
On 10 February 2003 Roche and Disetronic announced plans under which the Group would
acquire the Infusion Systems division of Disetronic. Disetronic is a world leader in the research
and development of insulin pumps for the treatment of diabetes. The proposed acquisition is
subject to approval from the competition authorities and by Disetronic’s shareholders. The total
net cost of the acquisition is expected to be approximately 1.2 billion Swiss francs.

68 Financial ReviewThe adjusted basis
The concept of the adjusted basis: management’s view of the Group’s on-going operations
presented on a consistent and comparable basis
The consolidated results of the Roche Group are significantly influenced by various special items
and also by changes in International Financial Reporting Standards over the years. To improve
thevisibility of the underlying business the adjusted results are also presented. These adjusted
results, which are used in the internal management of the business, represent the results of
theGroup’s underlying on-going operations. The principles used to compile the adjusted results
are applied on a consistent basis. The major concepts are as follows:
The adjusted results include:
– Gains or losses on continuing product portfolio and asset realignments
– Sales and income from newly acquired products
– Impacts on sales and income of patent expiry, withdrawal or disposal of existing products
– Impairments of long-term assets (other than as part of a major restructuring)
– Costs of normal ongoing restructuring
– Gains or losses on sales of marketable securities
The adjusted results exclude:
– Gains or losses arising on disposal of fully consolidated subsidiaries or associated companies
– Discontinuing operations, such as the sale or spin-off of a whole business
– One-time costs of major restructuring and fundamental reorganisations
– Charges for exceptional legal cases
– Transition effects of changes and revisions to accounting policies
Specific items excluded from the adjusted results in 2002 and 2001
The 2002 adjusted results exclude:
– The gain on the part disposal of Nippon Roche and non-recurring charges relating to the
Chugai transaction
– The results of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division, including the impairment of net assets
and additional charges relating to the vitamin case
– The non-recurring costs of the Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring
– Additional charges in respect of major legal cases
– The impairment of financial assets
The 2001 adjusted results exclude:
– The results of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division, including the impairment of net assets
and additional charges relating to the vitamin case
– The non-recurring costs of the Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring

1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of the Roche Group have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards, including standards and interpretations issued
by the International Accounting Standards Board. They have been prepared using the historical
cost convention except that as disclosed in the accounting policies below certain items, including
derivatives and available-for-sale investments, are shown at fair value. They were approved
forissue by the Board of Directors on 24 February 2003.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities,
and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. If in the future
such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best judgement at the
dateof the financial statements, deviate from the actual circumstances, the original estimates and
assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the year in which the circumstances change.
Where necessary, the comparatives have been reclassified or extended from the previously
reported results to take into account presentational changes.
Consolidation policy
These financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd,
acompany registered in Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (hereafter ‘the Group’).
The subsidiaries are those companies controlled, directly or indirectly, by Roche Holding Ltd,
where control is defined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an enter-
prise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. This control is normally evidenced when Roche
Holding Ltd owns, either directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights of a company’s
share capital. Companies acquired during the year are consolidated from the date on which
operating control is transferred to the Group, and subsidiaries to be divested are included up to
the date of divestment. Companies acquired to be resold are not consolidated but are classified
as assets held for sale and carried at fair value. Assets identified for divestment in the following
year are reclassified as assets held for sale within other current assets. These assets normally
consist mainly of inventories, property, plant and equipment, and other long-term assets.
Investments in associated companies are accounted for by the equity method. These are com-
panies over which the Group exercises significant influence, but which it does not control. This
isnormally evidenced when the Group owns 20% or more of the voting rights of the company.
Interests in joint ventures are reported using the line-by-line proportionate consolidation method.
76 Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsForeign currency translation
Most Group companies use their local currency as their measurement currency. Certain Group
companies use other currencies (namely US dollars, Swiss francs or euros) as their measurement
currencies where this most usefully represents the results and financial positions of these com-
panies, given local economic conditions and circumstances. Local transactions in other curren-
cies are initially reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses
from the settlement of such transactions, as well as gains and losses on monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in other currencies are included in income, except when they are deferred
into equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using measurement currencies
other than Swiss francs (foreign entities) are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of
exchange. Sales, costs, expenses, net income and cash flows are translated at the average rates
of exchange for the year. Translation differences due to the changes in exchange rates between
the beginning and the end of the year and the difference between net income translated at the
average and year-end exchange rates are taken directly to equity. On the divestment of a foreign
entity, the identified cumulative currency translation differences relating to that foreign entity
arerecognised in income as part of the gain or loss on divestment.
Revenues and cost of sales
Sales represent amounts received and receivable for goods supplied and services rendered
tocustomers after deducting trade discounts and volume rebates and excluding sales and value
added taxes. Cash discounts are recorded as marketing and distribution expenses. Revenues
fromthe sale of products are recognised upon transfer to the customer of significant risks and
rewards, usually upon shipment. Royalty income is recognised on an accrual basis in accordance
with the economic substance of the agreement. Other revenues are recorded as earned or as
theservices are performed. Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and
related production overhead of goods manufactured and services rendered.
Research and development
Research costs are charged against income as incurred, with the exception of buildings and
major items of equipment, which are capitalised and depreciated. Development costs are
capitalised as intangible assets when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to
theGroup. Such intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the
expected benefit, and are reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date. Other develop-
ment costs are charged against income as incurred since the criteria for their recognition as
anasset are not met.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 77In-licensing, milestone and other up-front receipts and payments
Certain Group companies, notably Genentech, receive from third-parties up-front, milestone and
other similar non-refundable payments relating to the sale or licensing of products or technology.
Revenue associated with performance milestones is recognised based on achievement of the
milestones, as defined in the respective agreements. Revenue from non-refundable up-front
payments and licence fees is initially reported as deferred income and is recognised in income
asearned over the period of the development collaboration or the manufacturing obligation.
Payments made by Group companies to third parties and associated companies for such items
are charged against income as research and development costs unless it is probable that future
economic benefits will flow to the Group, which is normally evidenced by regulatory approval. In
this case they are capitalised as development costs and amortised as described above. In practice
this means that most in-licensing and milestone payments for pharmaceutical products are
expensed as incurred, as in most cases they have not yet gained regulatory approval. Receipts
and payments between consolidated subsidiaries, such as between Genentech and other Roche
Group subsidiaries, are eliminated on consolidation.
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and
non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by
employees of the Group. Where the Group provides long-term employee benefits, the cost is
accrued to match the rendering of the services by the employees concerned.
The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans throughout the
world. The cost for the year for defined benefit plans is determined using the projected unit credit
method. This reflects service rendered by employees to the dates of valuation and incorporates
actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of
benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth, and long-term expected rates of return for
planassets. Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds in the
country concerned. Differences between assumptions and actual experiences, and effects of
changes in actuarial assumptions are allocated over the estimated average remaining working
lives of employees, where these differences exceed a defined corridor. Past service costs are
allocated over the average period until the benefits become vested. Pension assets and liabilities
in different defined benefit schemes are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable
right to use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan. Pension assets are only
recognised to the extent that the Group is able to derive future economic benefits in the way of
refunds from the plan or reductions of future contributions.
The Group’s contributions to the defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement
in the year to which they relate.
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding
taxes payable on the distribution of retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based
onincome, such as property and capital taxes, are included within operating expenses or financial
expenses according to their nature.
Provision for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of
retained earnings, principally relating to subsidiaries, is only made where there is a current inten-
tion to remit such earnings.
78 Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsDeferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences between the
tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred
income tax assets relating to the carry-forward of unused tax losses are recognised to the extent
that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses
can be utilised.
Current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are
leviedby the same taxation authority and when there is a legally enforceable right to offset them.
Deferred income taxes are determined based on the currently enacted tax rates applicable in
each tax jurisdiction where the Group operates.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction and are
depreciated on a straight-line basis, except for land, which is not depreciated. Estimated useful
lives of major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
Buildings and land improvements 40 years
Machinery and equipment 5–15 years
Office equipment 3 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Investment grants or similar assistance for projects are initially recorded as deferred income
(inother non-current liabilities) and are subsequently recognised as income over the useful lives
of the related assets. Repairs and maintenance costs are recognised as expenses as incurred.
Borrowing costs are not capitalised. Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated over
their estimated useful lives. Payments made under operating leases are charged against income
on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Intangible assets and Business combinations
Goodwill is recorded as an intangible asset and is the surplus of the cost of acquisition over the
fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill and fair value adjustments are treated
as assets and liabilities of the acquired company and are recorded in the local currency of that
company.
Patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value.
Where these assets have been acquired through a business combination, this will be the fair
value allocated in the acquisition accounting. Where these have been acquired other than
through a business combination, the initial fair value will be cost.
All intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis. Estimated useful
lives of major classes of intangible assets are as follows:
Goodwill 5–20 years
Patents, licences, trademarks Lower of legal duration and
and other intangible assets economic useful life, up to a maximum of 20 years
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 79Impairment of long-term assets
When the recoverable amount of an asset, being the higher of its net selling price and its value
inuse, is less than its carrying amount, then the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable
value. This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. Value in use is
calculated using estimated cash flows, generally over a five-year period, with extrapolating
projections for subsequent years. These are discounted using an appropriate long-term pre-tax
interest rate. When an impairment arises the useful life of the asset in question is reviewed and,
ifnecessary, the future depreciation/amortisation charge is accelerated.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined by the first-
in first-out method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash on hand and time, call and current balances with
banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which
are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. This definition is also used for the cash flow
statement.
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The
original cost of acquisition, consideration received for subsequent resale of these equity instru-
ments and other movements are reported as changes in equity. These instruments have been
acquired primarily to meet the obligations that may arise in respect of certain of the Group’s debt
instruments.
As at 31 December 2002 the Group revised its accounting policy for the classification of obliga-
tions to repurchase own equity instruments. These are now shown as a liability and are measured
at their present value, which is the final obligation discounted using an appropriate long-term
pre-tax interest rate. This discount will in future be amortised over the duration of the obligation,
and will be recognised as part of interest expense in the income statement.
Debt instruments
Debt instruments are initially reported at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction
costs. Subsequently they are reported at amortised cost using the effective interest method. To
the extent that debt instruments are hedged under qualifying fair value hedges, the hedged item
is recorded at fair value. Any discount between the net proceeds received and the principal value
due on redemption is amortised over the duration of the debt instrument, and is recognised as
part of interest expense in the income statement.
On issue of convertible debt instruments, the cost of the liability portion is initially calculated
using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible instrument. The remainder of
thenet proceeds is allocated to the equity conversion option, which is reported in equity, and to
deferred income tax liabilities. Where the equity conversion option is on shares of a consolidated
subsidiary, the portion of net proceeds attributable to that option is recorded within minority
interest. The liability element is subsequently reported at amortised cost. Amortisation of the debt
discount and release of the deferred tax liabilities are recognised in the income statement over
the duration of the debt instrument. The value of the equity conversion option is not changed in
future periods.
The limited conversion preferred stock is in substance a financial liability rather than an equity
instrument, and therefore it is classified as long-term debt in the balance sheet and the related
dividend payments are treated as interest expense.
80 Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsProvisions
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will
probably lead to an outflow of resources that can be reasonably estimated. Provisions are
recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise, taking into account foreign
currency effects and the time value of money. A contingent liability is disclosed where the
existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events, or where the amount of the
obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.
Fair values
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged
between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by
reference to quoted market prices adjusted for estimated transaction costs that would be
incurred in an actual transaction, or by the use of established estimation techniques such as
option pricing models and estimated discounted values of cash flows. The fair values at the
balance sheet date are approximately in line with their reported carrying values unless specifically
mentioned in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Financial assets
Financial assets, principally investments, including marketable securities, are classified as either
‘Held-for-trading’, ‘Available-for-sale’, ‘Held-to-maturity’ or ‘Originated by the Group’. Held-for-
trading financial assets are acquired principally to generate profit from short-term fluctuations
inprice. Held-to-maturity financial assets are securities with a fixed maturity that the Group has
the intent and ability to hold until maturity. Financial assets originated by the Group are loans
andother long-term financial assets created by the Group or acquired from the issuer in a primary
market. All other financial assets are considered as available-for-sale.
All financial assets are initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs. All purchases and
sales are recognised on the settlement date. Held-for-trading financial assets are subsequently
carried at fair value, with all changes in fair value recorded as financial income (expense) in the
period in which they arise. Held-to-maturity financial assets are subsequently carried at amor-
tised cost using the effective interest rate method. Available-for-sale financial assets are subse-
quently carried at fair value, with all unrealised changes in fair value recorded in equity. When the
available-for-sale financial assets are sold, impaired or otherwise disposed of, the cumulative
gains and losses previously recognised in equity are included in financial income (expense) for
the current period. Financial assets originated by the Group are subsequently carried at amortised
cost.
Financial assets are assessed for possible impairment at each balance sheet date. An impairment
charge is recorded where there is objective evidence of impairment, such as where the issuer is
in bankruptcy, default or other significant financial difficulty.
As at 31 December 2002 the Group revised its accounting policy for impairment of financial
assets. In addition to the above impairment triggers, any available-for-sale financial assets that
have a market value of more than 25% below their original cost for a sustained six-month period
will be considered as impaired. Any falls in the market price of less than 25% of original cost
orfor less than a sustained six-month period are not by themselves considered as objective
evidence of impairment, and such movements in fair value are recorded in equity until there
isobjective evidence of impairment or until the asset is sold or otherwise disposed of.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 81Derivatives
All derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs.
Derivatives are subsequently carried at fair value. Apart from those derivatives designated as
qualifying cash flow hedging instruments (see below), all changes in fair value arerecorded as
financial income (expense) in the period in which they arise.
Hedging
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types. Fair value
hedges are hedges of particular risks that may change the fair value of a recognised asset or
liability. Cash flow hedges are hedges of particular risks that may change the amount or timing
offuture cash flows. Hedges of net investment in a foreign entity are hedges of particular risks
that may change the carrying value of the net assets of a foreign entity.
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions
ondocumentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
If these conditions are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting.
Inthis case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there
were no hedging relationship. In particular any derivatives are reported at fair value, with
changes in fair value included in financial income (expense).
For qualifying fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged
item is recorded at its previous carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair value that are
attributable to the hedged risk. Any changes in the fair values are reported in financial income
(expense).
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of
any change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity, and any remaining inef-
fective portion is reported in financial income (expense). If the hedging relationship is the hedge
of a firm commitment or highly probable forecasted transaction, the cumulative changes of fair
value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in the initial car-
rying value of the asset or liability at the time it is recognised. For all other qualifying cash flow
hedges, the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded
in equity are included in financial income (expense) at the time when the forecasted transaction
affects net income.
For qualifying hedges of net investment in a foreign entity, the hedging instrument is recorded at
fair value. The portion of any change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity.
Any remaining ineffective portion is recorded in financial income (expense) where the hedging
instrument is a derivative and in equity in other cases. If the entity is disposed of, then the cumu-
lative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are
included in financial income (expense) at the time of the disposal.
International Financial Reporting Standards
There were no revised or new standards or interpretations that became effective from 1 January
2002 that had a significant effect on the Group’s financial statements.
82 Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsChanges effective 1 January 2001
Several revised or new standards and interpretations became effective from 1 January 2001.
Theprincipal item affecting the Group was the Standard on ‘Financial instruments: recognition
and measurement’. Implementing these changes resulted in an increase in equity of 382 million
Swiss francs effective 1 January 2001, which has been included in the comparative opening
balances in these consolidated financial statements. These changes are fully described in the
2001 consolidated financial statements.
Future developments in International Financial Reporting Standards
International Financial Reporting Standards will continue to develop over the coming years.
TheInternational Accounting Standards Board has published several exposure drafts, however
atthe time ofpublication of these financial statements no new standards had been adopted
thatwould need to be applied in 2003.
2. Financial risk management
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies and guidelines approved by
senior management. These policies and guidelines cover foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk,
market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Group policies and guidelines also cover areas such as
cash management, investment of excess funds and the raising of short- and long-term debt.
Group companies report details of the financial instruments outstanding and financial liquidity to
Group Treasury on at least a monthly basis. During 2001 a new post of Financial Risk Manager
was created to oversee compliance with the Group’s financial risk management policies and
guidelines and policies.
The Group, in accordance with its risk management guidelines, continues to monitor these risks,
and when deemed appropriate, certain of the above risks are significantly altered through the use
of financial instruments, such as derivatives. Group management believes that, in order to create
the optimum value for the Group, it is not desirable to eliminate or mitigate all possible market
fluctuations.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates across the world and is exposed to movements in foreign currencies affecting
its net income and financial position, as expressed in Swiss francs. The Group continues to
monitor its currency exposures, and when appropriate, enters into transactions with the aim of
preserving the value of assets, commitments and anticipated transactions. The Group uses
forward contracts and foreign currency options to optimise certain anticipated foreign exchange
revenues, cash flows and financing transactions.
Transaction exposure arises because the amount of local currency paid or received for trans-
actions denominated in foreign currencies may vary due to changes in exchange rates. For many
Group companies income will be primarily in the local currency. A significant amount of expendi-
ture, especially for purchase of goods for resale and interest on and repayment of loans will be in
foreign currencies. Similarly, transaction exposure arises on net balances of monetary assets held
in foreign currencies. Group companies manage this exposure at a local level, if necessary by
means of financial instruments such as options and forward contracts. In addition, Group Treasury
monitors total worldwide exposure with the help of comprehensive data received on a monthly
basis.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 83Translation exposure arises from the consolidation of the foreign currency denominated finan-
cial statements of the Group’s foreign subsidiaries. The effect on the Group’s consolidated equity
is shown as a currency translation movement. The Group hedges significant net investments in
foreign currencies by taking foreign currency loans or issuing foreign currency denominated debt
instruments. Major translation exposures are monitored on a regular basis.
A significant part of the Group’s cash outflows for research, development, production and admin-
istration is denominated in Swiss francs, while a much smaller proportion of the Group’s cash
inflows are Swiss franc denominated. As a result, an increase in the value of the Swiss franc rela-
tive to other currencies has an adverse impact on consolidated net income. Similarly, a relative
fall in the value of the Swiss franc has a favourable effect on results published in Swiss francs.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could have adverse effects on
theGroup’s net income or financial position. Changes in interest rates cause variations in interest
income and expenses on interest-bearing assets and liabilities. In addition, they can affect the
market value of certain financial assets, liabilities and instruments as described in the following
section on market risk. The interest rates on the Group’s major debt instruments are fixed,
asdescribed in Note 29, which reduces the Group’s exposure to changes in interest rates. Group
companies manage their short-term interest rate risk at a local level, if necessary using financial
instruments such as interest rate forward contracts, swaps and options.
Market risk
Changes in the market value of certain financial assets, liabilities and instruments can affect the
net income or financial position of the Group. Long-term investments are held for strategic pur-
poses and marketable securities are held for fund management purposes. The risk of loss in value
is reduced by reviews prior to investing, concentration of investments and continuous monitoring
of the performance of investments and changes in their risk configuration. Investments in equity
and fixed income instruments are entered into on the basis of approved guidelines with regard to
liquidity and credit rating.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counter-party to a transaction may be unable or
unwilling to meet their obligations causing a financial loss to the Group. Trade receivables are
subject to a policy of active risk management focussing on the assessment of country risk, credit
availability, ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures. There are no signifi-
cant concentrations within trade receivables of counter-party credit risk, due to the Group’s large
number of customers and their wide geographical spread. Country risk limits and exposures are
continuously monitored. The exposure of other financial assets to credit risk is controlled by set-
ting a policy for limiting credit exposure to high-quality counter-parties, on-going reviews of
credit ratings, and limiting individual aggregate credit exposure accordingly.
84 Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsLiquidity risk
Group companies need to have sufficient availability of cash to meet their obligations. Individual
companies are responsible for their own cash management, including the short-term investment
of cash surpluses and the raising of loans to cover cash deficits, subject to guidance by the
Group and, in certain cases, to approval at Group level. The Group maintains sufficient reserves
of cash and readily realisable marketable securities to meet its liquidity requirements at all times.
In addition, the strong international creditworthiness of the Group allows it to make efficient use
of international capital markets for financing purposes.

The Group has three divisions: Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics and Vitamins and Fine Chemicals. The disclosure on the Pharmaceuticals Division
includes four reportable segments: Roche prescription, Genentech prescription, Japan prescription and OTC.
• The ‘Japan prescription’ business segment includes the results of the newly merged Chugai company (which includes the former Nippon Roche
business) from 1 October 2002, and also includes the results of Nippon Roche for the periods until 30 September 2002. Nippon Roche’s results for
2001 have been reclassified from the segment ‘Roche prescription’ to the segment ‘Japan prescription’ (see Note 6). The results of Chugai’s OTC
business are included in the ‘Japan prescription’ business segment.
• The Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division is in the process of being demerged and is considered a non-core business (see Note 8).
• The segment ‘Others’ consists of the costs of Corporate Headquarters and other costs that cannot be reasonably attributed to the other reported
segments.

ties consist of trade accounts payable. Other segment assets and liabilities consist of assets and liabilities which can be reasonably attributed to
the reported business segments. These include pension assets and liabilities and provisions.
• Non-segment assets and liabilities mainly include current and deferred income tax balances, and financial assets and liabilities, principally cash,
marketable securities, investments in associated companies, other investments and debt.
• Capital expenditure comprises additions to intangible assets (including goodwill) and additions to property, plant and equipment, including those
arising from acquisitions.

5. Genentech
Effective 7 September 1990 the Group acquired a majority interest of approximately 60% of
Genentech, Inc., a biotechnology company in the United States. On 13 June 1999 the Group exer-
cised its option to acquire the remaining shares of Genentech on 30 June 1999, at which point
Genentech became a 100% owned subsidiary of the Group. On 23 July 1999, 26 October 1999 and
29 March 2000 the Group completed public offerings of Genentech’s Common Stock, as a result
88 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statementsof which the Group’s majority interest was 60%. Genentech issues additional shares of common
stock in connection with its equity compensation plans, and also may issue additional shares for
other purposes. The affiliation agreement between the Group and Genentech provides, amongst
other things, that Genentech establish a stock repurchase programme to maintain the Group’s
percentage ownership interest in Genentech. At 31 December 2002 the Group’s interest in
Genentech was 59.8% (2001: 58.0%).
The common stock of Genentech is publicly traded and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
under the symbol DNA. Genentech is incorporated in Delaware, and its principal executive offices
are in South San Francisco, California. Its market capitalisation as at 31 December 2002 was
17.0billion US dollars (23.6 billion Swiss francs). Genentech prepares financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP). These
are filed on a quarterly basis with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Due to certain
consolidation entries and differences in the requirements of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and US GAAP, there are differences between Genentech’s stand-alone results
on a US GAAP basis and the results of Genentech as consolidated by the Roche Group in
accordance with IFRS. These are reconciled in the table below:

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 89Differences between IFRS and US GAAP
Following the acquisition by the Group of 100% interest in Genentech on 30 June 1999, the analy-
sis carried out for the acquisition accounting identified a total of 1,253 million US dollars that was
attributable to in-process research and development (IPR&D). In Genentech’s US GAAP financial
statements these items have been recorded in 1999 as either an adjustment to equity or as a
one-time expense. Under IFRS these items cannot be classified as separate assets at the date of
acquisition and therefore form part of goodwill. Therefore in the years subsequent to 1999 there
is a goodwill amortisation expense in respect of this IPR&D in the Group’s results under IFRS.
Genentech adopted US accounting standards FAS 141 and FAS 142 effective 1 January 2002,
under which goodwill is no longer amortised, but is subject to an impairment test at least annually.
Under IFRS goodwill continues to be amortised, while also being subject to testing for impairment.
Genentech stock repurchases and stock options
On 31 October 2001 Genentech’s Board of Directors authorised a stock repurchase programme
torepurchase up to 625 million US dollars of Genentech’s common stock. On 15 August 2002
Genentech’s Board authorised an extension to repurchase up to an additional 375 million of com-
mon stock. During 2002 Genentech has repurchased 693 million US dollars (1,079 million Swiss
francs) of their own common stock. In 2001 common stock worth 40 million US dollars (67 million
Swiss francs) was repurchased, which includes 34 million US dollars (57 million Swiss francs)
thatwas repurchased prior to 31 October 2001.
Genentech has a stock option plan adopted in 1999 and amended in 2000. The plan allows for
thegranting of various stock options, stock awards and stock appreciation rights to employees,
directors and consultants of Genentech.
Movements in the number of options held by Genentech employees are as follows:
2002 2001
Outstanding at 1 January 46,639,970 40,944,862
Issued 12,655,875 10,740,689
Exercised (1,672,772) (2,899,135)
Cancellations (2,203,658) (2,146,446)
Outstanding at end of period 55,419,415 46,639,970
– of which exercisable 30,322,658 21,454,862
Options issued during the year had an average exercise price of USD 28.98 (2001: 42.58).
Optionsexercised during the year were exercised at an average price of USD 23.43 (2001: 24.69).
The cash inflow from Genentech’ stock option and employee stock plans was 74 million US dol-
lars, or 116 million Swiss francs (2001: 107 million US dollars, or 180 million Swiss francs). Using
the Black-Scholes option valuation model, the fair value of options issued in 2002 was 159 million
US dollars, or 247 million Swiss francs (2001: 258 million US dollars, or 435 million Swiss francs).
The net accounting effect of stock repurchases and stock options is recorded to minority interests
(see Note 28).
Other matters
As discussed in Note 9, the Group has recorded a provision of 518 million US dollars (778 million
Swiss francs) in respect of certain litigation matters, including litigation involving the City of Hope.
On 19 January 2000 the Group issued ‘LYONs IV’ zero coupon US dollar notes that are exchange-
able into Genentech shares. If all of these notes were converted the Group’s percentage owner-
ship in Genentech would decrease by approximately 2.5%. See also Note 29.
90 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements6. Chugai
On 10 December 2001, Roche and Chugai announced that they would enter into an alliance to
create a leading research-driven Japanese pharmaceutical company, which would be formed by
the merger of Chugai (excluding Gen-Probe) and Roche’s Japanese pharmaceuticals subsidiary,
Nippon Roche. Under the terms of the alliance, both Chugai and Nippon Roche were inde-
pendently valued. Roche agreed to make additional cash contributions in order to bring Roche’s
participation to 50.1% of the agreed combined value. The alliance was approved by the share-
holders of Chugai at their Annual General Meeting on 27 June 2002.
The newly merged company, known as Chugai, is a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group.
Roche is the majority shareholder with 50.1% ownership and there is a 49.9% minority interest.
Chugai is domiciled in Tokyo and listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The market capitalisation
at31 December 2002 was 622.2 billion Japanese yen (7.3 billion Swiss francs).
Transaction process
In late-September 2002, Roche acquired through a public tender offer approximately 10% (30 mil-
lion shares) of Chugai’s outstanding shares at the price of JPY 2,800 per share. The total cash
outflow from the Group as a result of this tender offer was 84.0 billion Japanese yen (1,027 million
Swiss francs). Immediately after the tender offer, Roche subscribed to an issue by Chugai of
21.1million new shares at a price of JPY 1,780 per share, which resulted in a cash contribution
toChugai of 37.6 billion Japanese yen (459 million Swiss francs). On 16 September 2002, before
closing the tender offer by Roche, Chugai completed the spin-off of its 100% shareholdings
inGen-Probe, its California-based diagnostics subsidiary, to its registered shareholders as of
31July 2002.
On 1 October 2002, Chugai merged with Nippon Roche. Prior to the merger Nippon Roche issued
convertible bonds to the Roche Group (Roche CB), the obligation to which succeeded to Chugai.
On 1 October Roche acquired additional shares of Chugai by the conversion of such bonds in pro-
portion to the shares issued by Chugai from the conversion of the convertible bonds previously
issued by Chugai to third parties (Chugai CB), such that Roche’s ownership reached 50.1%. This
resulted in a cash contribution of 37.7 billion Japanese yen (460 million Swiss francs). On an
on-going basis Roche will convert the remaining Roche CB into Chugai shares corresponding to
the conversion of the remaining Chugai CB such that Roche maintains a 50.1% ownership in
Chugai.
Purchase consideration
The closing of the transaction was on 1 October 2002. The transaction is accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting. The consideration paid by Roche for 50.1% of Chugai consists of
firstly the public tender offer, secondly the 49.9% of the subscription to new Chugai shares and con-
version of the Roche CB that relates to minority shareholders and thirdly the 49.9% of the net assets
of Nippon Roche that are now attributable to minority shareholders. As Nippon Roche was not a
public company, the 49.9% of the net assets of Nippon Roche were valued with reference to the fair
value of the Chugai shares acquired in exchange. This allocation is shown in the table below.
JPY billions CHF millions
Public tender offer 84.0 1,027
Subscription (49.9% of 37.6 billion JPY) 18.7 229
Convertible bonds (49.9% of 37.7 billion JPY) 18.8 230

Transaction costs 1.7 21
Purchase consideration for 50.1% of Chugai 224.3 2,743
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 91Acquisition accounting
The market value of the Chugai shares acquired was 182.9 billion Japanese yen (2,237 million
Swiss francs), which corresponds to 50.1% of the market capitalisation of Chugai prior to the
transaction. The purchase consideration of 224.3 billion Japanese yen (2,743 million Swiss francs)
therefore represents a surplus of 41.4 billion Japanese yen (506 million Swiss francs) over the
market value of the Chugai shares acquired. This surplus was written-off, so that the recorded net
assets of Chugai do not exceed the market capitalisation. As a result of the transaction a gain of
89.3 billion Japanese yen (1,092 million Swiss francs) arises on the part disposal of Nippon
Roche. Accordingly net income of 47.9 billion Yen (586 million Swiss francs) wasrecognised in
theincome statement for these two amounts.
The acquired net assets of Chugai are shown in the table below. The amount allocated to good-
will includes 10.2 billion Japanese yen (125 million Swiss francs) that is attributable to in-process
research and development. Under International Financial Reporting Standards these items cannot
be classified as separate assets at the date of acquisition and therefore form part of goodwill.

Ongoing impacts of purchase accounting
From 1 October 2002, Chugai’s results are included in the Group’s consolidated financial state-
ments. ‘Japan prescription’ is shown as a separate business segment in the segment information.
The ‘Japan prescription’ business segment includes the results of the newly merged Chugai
company (which includes the former Nippon Roche business) from 1 October 2002, and also
includes the results of Nippon Roche for the periods until 30 September 2002. For comparability,
Nippon Roche’s results for 2001 have been reclassified from the segment ‘Roche prescription’
tothe segment ‘Japan prescription’. The results of Chugai’s OTC business are included in the ‘Japan
prescription’ business segment. Segment information is given in Note 4.

amortised on a straight-line basis over 15 years and between 10 and 18 years respectively.
7. Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring in millions of CHF
On 30 May 2001 the Group announced the ‘Re-shaping for Future Growth’ initiative, a restructur-
ing of its Pharmaceuticals Division, with the objective of improving the long-term profitability of
the division by increasing sales and reducing the division’s cost structure. Activity during the year
is shown in the table below. No significant additional costs are expected in 2003.

8. Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division in millions of CHF
In early 2002 the Group announced plans to demerge the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division.
On 3 September 2002, the Group announced that it had reached an agreement, subject to the
execution of a final definitive purchase agreement and the necessary regulatory approvals, to sell
its global Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business to the Dutch company DSM. A final purchase
agreement was signed on 10 February 2003 and the sale is expected to close in the first half of
2003. The expected transaction price is 1.95 billion euros, which will consist of 1.85 billion euros
in cash, and 2.24 million shares in DSM with a value of approximately 100 million euros. At
31December 2002 exchange rates, 1.95 billion euros is equivalent to 2.8 billion Swiss francs.
The Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division is now treated as a discontinuing operation, however
until the sale is closed it will continue to be included in the consolidated figures. The sales,
results, assets, liabilities and net cash flows of the division as part of the Roche Group are shown
as discontinuing operations in the following table:

Impairment of net assets
Based on the final agreement, Group management estimates that the current carrying value of
the net assets of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business is in excess of the expected net
proceeds from the sale. Accordingly, an impairment of 1,650 million Swiss francs has been recorded
against the assets of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division. In addition, tax expenses of
200 million Swiss francs have been recorded, based upon the preliminary estimate of the tax
liability that will arise on disposal.
As the sale will not close until the first half of 2003, the final amount of the gain or loss on
thedisposal ofthe net assets of Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business, including the tax effects,
maybe different from the amounts currently recorded.
94 Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsVitamin case
Following the settlement agreement with the US Department of Justice on 20 May 1999 regarding
pricing practices in the vitamin market and the overall settlement agreement to a class action
suitbrought by the US buyers of bulk vitamins, the Group recorded provisions in respect of the
vitamin case in 1999. These provisions were the Group’s best estimate at that time of the total
liability that may arise, taking into account currency movements and the time value of money.
Provisions for legal fees were recorded separately. At 31 December 2001, based on the development
of the litigation and recent settlement negotiations, the Group recorded additional provisions of
760 million Swiss francs.
At 31 December 2002 the Group reassessed the adequacy of its remaining provisions for the
vitamin case. Based on the development of the litigation and recent settlement negotiations,
mainly in the United States with direct customers who had previously opted out of the class
action settlement, the Group has recorded additional provisions of 1,770 million Swiss francs.
Total payments during the year were 3,266 million Swiss francs (2001: 330 million Swiss francs).
Payments made in 2002 include fines imposed by the European Union totalling 525 million euros
(778 million Swiss francs) and settlements with direct and indirect customers in the United States
totalling 1,707 million US dollars (2,455 million Swiss francs).
The Group is seeking to resolve the remaining outstanding issues, however the timing and the
final amounts involved are uncertain. The provisions recorded are based on current litigation and
recent settlement agreements. As the litigation and negotiations progress, it is possible that the
ultimate liability may be different from the amount of provisions currently recorded.
On 17 January 2003 the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that non-US plaintiffs
may bring claims in US courts under US anti-trust laws for alleged damages suffered from
transactions outside the United States in connection with the vitamin case. The defendants,
including Roche, will appeal against this decision. No provisions have been recorded in respect
ofthis litigation as the eventual outcome is uncertain at this stage.
As part of the demerger process, the liabilities in respect of the vitamin case will remain with
theRoche Group. Roche and DSM have signed an Indemnity and Co-operation Agreement under
which Roche may provide DSM with certain indemnities and guarantees in connection with the
vitamin case.
9. Major legal cases
Developments during the year for major legal cases are discussed below, including their impact
on the Group’s results, possible future development and contingent liabilities, if any. Total
expenses during the year were 778 million Swiss francs in respect of Genentech legal cases.
Igen litigation
On 15 February 2002 the United States District Court of Maryland entered judgement in the civil
litigation between Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany (RDG) and Igen International, Inc. (Igen)
over claims related to the licensing of Igen’s electrochemiluminescence (ECL) to RDG. The court
concluded that several breaches of the licence agreement were material so that Igen has the right
to terminate the licence agreement, and awarded Igen 105.4 million US dollars in compensatory
damages and 400 million US dollars in punitive damages. RDG has appealed against this judge-
ment and a final resolution is not expected until the second half of 2003. An existing order of the
court bars any licence termination until all appeal proceedings are completed. Whileany appeal is
in progress, RDG will continue to provide its customers with the products andservices and will
continue all planned innovations based on the ECL technology.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 95RDG and previously Boehringer Mannheim have been in litigation since 1997 over these matters.
When acquiring Boehringer Mannheim, RDG assessed the Igen litigation and the adequacy of the
provision already recorded by Boehringer Mannheim. RDG has reassessed the adequacy of these
provisions and has concluded that, based on currently available information, it is not appropriate
to record additional provisions at this point. The total amount of the provisions is the liability that
RDG expects to pay, adjusted for foreign currency translation effects and the time value of
money. As litigation is in process it is possible that the final obligation may be different from this.
The total amount of the provisions is not disclosed as this may prejudice the RDG position in
current litigation, however the provisions are significantly less than the amounts awarded by the
court.
In March 2002 Roche Diagnostics GmbH (RDG) paid 606 million US dollars (1,018 million Swiss
francs) into a collateral deposit account in respect of the Igen litigation. This is reported as
restricted cash within financial long-term assets (see Note 17). No additional provisions have
been recorded during the year.
Genentech legal cases
The Group has recorded a provision of 518 million US dollars (778 million Swiss francs) in respect
of certain litigation matters, including litigation involving the City of Hope.
On 10 June 2002 Genentech announced that a Los Angeles County Superior Court jury voted to
award City of Hope Medical Center approximately 300 million US dollars in compensatory dam-
ages based on a finding of a breach of a 1976 agreement between Genentech and the City of
Hope. On 24 June 2002 the jury voted to award City of Hope 200 million US dollars in punitive
damages in the same case. On 13 September 2002 Genentech filed a notice of appeal of the jury
verdict and damages awards with the California Court of Appeal. The appeals process will take
from one to four years depending on the scope of the review. A full provision has been recorded
for these awards. During the appeals process interest accrues on the total amount of the
damages at a simple annual rate of 10%. Following the judgment interest of 26 million US dollars
(40 million Swiss francs) was recorded as the time cost of provisions, within interest expenses
(see Note 12). On 3 October 2002 Genentech entered into an arrangement with third party
insurance companies to post a surety bond of 600 million US dollars in connection with this
judgement. As part of this arrangement Genentech pledged 630 million US dollars in cash
andinvestments to secure this bond. These amounts, which are equivalent to 874 million Swiss
francs, are reported as restricted cash within financial long-term assets (see Note 17).
In addition, Genentech is party to a patent infringement suit filed by Chiron Corporation on
7June2000 in the US District Court in the Eastern District of California (Sacramento) in respect
of Herceptin. On 25 June 2002 the court issued several decisions regarding summary judgement
motions that had been filed. The jury trial of this suit began on 6 August 2002. Following the first
phase of the trial, based on the findings by the jury, the Court entered judgement in favour of
Genentech. On 20 November 2002 Chiron filed notice of appeal with the US Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit. On 4 December 2002 Genentech filed notice of cross-appeal with the same
court. On 12 August 2002 the United States Patent and Trademark Office declared an interference
between the Chiron patent involved in this lawsuit and a patent application exclusively licensed
toGenentech from the University of Pennsylvania relating to anti-HER2 antibodies. In declaring
the interference, the Patent Office has determined that there is substantial question as to whether
the inventors of the Chiron patent were the first to invent the technology involved and are entitled
to the patent. In connection with a second patent infringement lawsuit filed on 13 March 2001
against Genentech by Chiron, discovery in this case is currently stayed.
96 Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsIn connection with a patent infringement lawsuit filed against Genentech by GlaxoSmithKline
(Glaxo) on 14 September 2000, in September 2002 Genentech and Glaxo agreed to a settlement
pursuant to which Genentech and Glaxo dismissed with prejudice all the claims and/or counter-
claims made by each of them in this lawsuit (and in a previous patent infringement lawsuit filed
against Genentech by Glaxo on 28 May 1999, involving other patents). The settlement resolves
and ends all the patent infringement claims that Glaxo made against Genentech.
Genentech is party to other litigation, as described in Genentech’s annual report and quarterly
SEC filings, however these other matters are not as far advanced as the matters referred to above.

Post-employment benefits: defined contribution plans 146 99
Other employee benefits 331 308
Total employees’ remuneration 7,528 7,416
The charges for employee benefits are included in the relevant expenditure line by function. The
number of employees at the year-end was 69,659 (2001: 63,717). Other employee benefits consist
mainly of life insurance schemes and certain other insurance schemes providing medical and
dental cover.
Post-employment benefits
Most employees are covered by retirement benefit plans sponsored by Group companies. The
nature of such plans varies according to legal regulations, fiscal requirements and economic con-
ditions of the countries in which the employees are employed. Other post-employment benefits
consist mostly of post-retirement healthcare and life insurance schemes, principally in the United
States. Plans are usually funded by payments from the Group and by employees to trusts inde-
pendent of the Group’s finances. Where a plan is unfunded, a liability for the whole obligation is
recorded in the Group’s balance sheet.
The amounts recognised in arriving at operating profit for post-employment defined benefit plans
are as follows:
2002 2001
Current service cost 314 362
Interest cost 627 685
Expected return on plan assets (688) (761)
Net actuarial (gains) losses recognised 22 (12)
Past service cost 4 5
(Gains) losses on curtailment – (15)
Total included in employees’ remuneration 279 264
The actual return on plan assets was a negative return of 1,022 million Swiss francs (2001: negative
return of 1,334 million Swiss francs).
In September 2002 the Group paid an additional contribution of 340 million US dollars (530 mil-
lion Swiss francs) into a post-employment defined benefit plan of one of its US subsidiaries, due
to falls in the market value of this plan’s assets during 2002. This payment is included in ‘contri-
butions paid’ in the table below and is accounted for as part of the recognised surplus on funded
pension plans (see also Note 18) in the Group’s consolidated financial statements in 2002. There-
after it will beincluded in the actuarial calculation of the Group’s pension expenses and balances.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 97The movements in the net asset (liability) recognised in the balance sheet for post-employment
defined benefit plans are as follows:

Plan assets held in trusts at fair value 387 530
Plan assets in excess of actuarial present value of funded obligations (419) (207)
– less unrecognised actuarial (gains) losses 206 (50)
Net recognised asset (liability) (213) (257)
Amounts recognised in the balance sheet for post-employment defined benefit plans are pre-
dominantly non-current and are reported as long-term assets and non-current liabilities.
Included within the fair value of the assets of the funded plans are 900,000 (2001: 650,000) of the
Group’s non-voting equity securities with a fair value of 87 million Swiss francs (2001: 77 million
Swiss francs).
98 Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsThe Group operates defined benefit schemes in many countries and the actuarial assumptions
vary based upon local economic and social conditions. The range of assumptions used in
theactuarial valuations of the most significant defined benefit plans, which are in countries
withstable currencies and interest rates, is as follows:
Discount rates 2 to 7% (2001: 3 to 8%)
Projected rates of remuneration growth 2 to 9% (2001: 2 to 9%)
Expected rates of return on plan assets 2 to 9% (2001: 3 to 10%)
Healthcare cost trend rate 4 to 12% (2001: 5 to 10%)
Stock Appreciation Rights
Some employees of certain US subsidiaries of the Group receive Stock Appreciation Rights
(SARs) as part of their compensation. The SARs may be exercised after a vesting period of two
tothree years for a cash payment, based upon the amount that the market price of the Group’s
American Depositary Shares (ADSs) at the point of exercise exceeds the strike price (grant
priceat issuance). The Group accrues for the expected cash outflow from the outstanding SARs.
As at 31 December 2002 no accrual was required.
Equity compensation benefits
During 2002 the Group has launched three equity compensation plans, as described below.
TheGenentech stock option plan is discussed in Note 5.
Roche Option Plan: The Group offers non-voting equity security options to certain directors and
management. The exercise price is the market price of the non-voting equity securities at the date
of issue. The options, which are non-tradable, have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased
basis over three years. The Group covers such obligations by purchasing non-voting equity secu-
rities, or derivatives thereon. The cost of these instruments is reported in own equity instruments,
within equity on the balance sheet. When the options are exercised the cash received is credited
to own equity instruments. There are no impacts on the income statement, other than employer
social insurance costs and the administrative costs of the plan. The previous option compensation
plan, whereby the Group purchased options directly from third party financial institutions and
granted them to certain employees, is closed; existing option grants under the old plan continue
but no further such options are being granted.
Movements in the number of options held by employees are as follows:
2002 2001
Outstanding at 1 January – –
Issued 562,259 –
Exercised – –
Cancellations – –
Outstanding at 31 December 562,259 –
Details of options granted during the period are as follows:
2002 2001
Issue date 26 February 2002 –
Expiry date 26 February 2009 –
Exercise price in CHF 115.50 –
Proceeds if all options are exercised in millions of CHF 65 –
Using the Black-Scholes option valuation model, the fair value of options issued in 2002 was
13million Swiss francs.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 99Roche Performance Share Plan: The Group offers future non-voting equity security grants to
certain directors and key senior management. The amount of non-voting equity securities granted
depends upon the individual’s salary level and the achievement of performance targets linked to
total shareholders’ return relative to the Group’s peers during the three-year period from the date
of the grant. If the targets are not met, then no grants are made. The grants vest after three years.
The cost of the plan is accrued over the vesting period of each grant, based on the final cash
outflow estimated at each balance sheet date. During the year the cost of the plan was 15 million
Swiss francs, which was reported within the relevant operating expense categories. The Group
covers such obligations by purchasing non-voting equity securities, or derivatives thereon. The
cost of purchasing these instruments is reported in own equity instruments, within equity on the
balance sheet.
Roche Connect: This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the
United States and certain other countries, to make regular deductions from their salaries to
purchase non-voting equity securities. It is administered by independent third parties. The Group
makes a contribution to the programme, which allows the employees to purchase non-voting
equity securities at a discount (usually 20%). The administrator purchases the necessary non-
voting equity securities directly from the market. 28,843 non-voting equity securities were held at
31 December 2002. The programme has been operational since 1 October 2002. During the year
the cost of the plan was 1 million Swiss francs, which was reported within the relevant operating
expense categories.

On 6 June 2001 the Group sold 6,000,000 shares of LabCorp, resulting in a pre-tax gain after
incidental costs of 1,160 million Swiss francs which was recorded as part of financial income
(expense), net. The net pre-tax cash inflow was 1,420 million Swiss francs. As of the date of this
sale the Group’s remaining investment in LabCorp was accounted for as available-for-sale
marketable securities. In March and July 2002 the Group sold its remaining shares of LabCorp.
These transactions resulted in a pre-tax gain after incidental costs of 1,032 million Swiss francs.
These amounts were recorded as part of financial income (expense), net. The net pre-tax cash
inflow was 1,246 million Swiss francs. In addition, the Group realised a gain of 167 million Swiss
francs on equity derivatives that were entered into in connection with the disposal of LabCorp
shares. As at 31December 2002 the Group has no remaining ownership interest in LabCorp and
no outstanding derivative positions in LabCorp equities.
Impairment of financial assets
As at 31 December 2002 the Group revised its accounting policy for impairment of financial
assets. In addition to the existing impairment triggers (as described in Note 1), any available-for-
sale financial assets that have a market value of more than 25% below their original cost for a
sustained six month period will be considered as impaired. Any falls in the market price of less
than 25% of original cost or for less than a sustained six-month period are not by themselves
considered as objective evidence of impairment, and such movements in fair value are recorded
in equity until there is objective evidence of impairment or until the asset is sold or otherwise
disposed of.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 101As a result of this revision in accounting policy, the Group recorded an impairment charge of
5,192million Swiss francs effective 31 December 2002.
13. Income taxes in millions of CHF
Income tax expenses
The amounts charged in the income statement are as follows:
2002 2001
Current income taxes 446 1,335
Deferred income taxes 393 (297)
Total charge for income taxes 839 1,038
Since the Group operates across the world, it is subject to income taxes in many different tax juris-
dictions. The Group calculates its average expected tax rate as a weighted average of the tax rates
in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates. This rate increased during 2002 as operating
income now makes up a considerably higher proportion of pre-tax income than has been the case
in previous years. This leads to an increase in the Group’s effective tax rate, as operating income
typically occurs in jurisdictions with higher tax rates when compared to financial income. Within the
Group’s average expected tax rate, the increasing significance of Genentech and Chugai accounts
for 1% of the increase in the rate. Deferred tax assets were not recorded for the local statutory
losses incurred in Argentina during 2002, as it is not clear when these may be utilised against
future local taxable income.
The Group’s effective tax rate can be reconciled to the Group’s average expected tax rate as
follows:
2002 2001
Group’s average expected tax rate 24% 22%
Tax effect of
– Argentina +1% –
– Amortisation of goodwill15 +3% +2%
– Gain from sale of LabCorp shares12 +1% +2%
– non-taxable income/non-deductible expenses +1% –
– other differences –1% –3%
Core businesses’ effective tax rate 29% 23%
Tax effect of
– Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring7 – –
– Major legal cases9 –2% –
– Discontinuing operation: Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division8 – –
– Vitamin case8 –4% –1%
– Chugai transaction: part disposal of Nippon Roche6 –4% –
– Chugai transaction: write-off of fair value adjustments to inventories6 –1% –
– Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division: impairment of net assets8 +26% –
– Impairment of financial assets12 –70% –
Group’s effective tax rate –26% 22%
The impairment of net assets of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division and the impairment
offinancial assets have a very significant impact on the effective tax rate for 2002, as they have
alarge impact on profit before tax whilst having a relatively minor impact on the tax charge.
102 Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsIncome tax assets and liabilities
Amounts recognised in the balance sheet for income taxes are as follows:
2002 2001
Current income taxes
Current income tax assets 1,028 244
Current income tax liabilities (849) (716)
Net current income tax asset (liability) in the balance sheet 179 (472)
Deferred income taxes
Deferred income tax assets 784 1,410
Deferred income tax liabilities (3,551) (4,162)
Net deferred income tax asset (liability) in the balance sheet (2,767) (2,752)
The increase of the current income tax assets is related to payments in the vitamin case and
Swiss withholding taxes which have subsequently been reimbursed in 2003. Deferred income tax
assets are recognised for tax loss carry forwards only to the extent that realisation of the related
tax benefit is probable. The Group has unrecognised tax losses of 205 million Swiss francs.
Deferred income tax liabilities have not been established for the withholding tax and other taxes
that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, as such
amounts are currently regarded as permanently reinvested. These unremitted earnings totalled
21.3 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2002 (2001: 27.1 billion Swiss francs).
The deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the deferred income tax charges (credits) are
attributable to the following items:

The Group’s subsidiary Genentech has synthetic leases on certain of its facilities in California,
which under the Group’s accounting policy are consolidated. As discussed in the 2001 financial
statements, these were recorded effective 1 January 2001, and at this date property, plant and
equipment increased by 1,113 million Swiss francs, with a similar increase in long-term debt
(seeNote 29). Excluding the Genentech synthetic leases, at 31 December 2002 the capitalised
cost of machinery and equipment under finance leases amounts to 341 million Swiss francs
(2001: 581 million Swiss francs) and the net book value of these assets amounts to 198 million
Swiss francs (2001: 221 million Swiss francs).
Operating lease commitments
At 31 December the future minimum annual payments under non-cancellable operating leases,
including the Genentech synthetic leases, were as follows:
2002 2001
Within one year 118 100
Between one and five years 205 140
Thereafter 13 12
Total minimum annual payments 336 252
Total rental expense in 2002 for all operating leases, including the Genentech synthetic leases,
was 239 million Swiss francs (2001: 299 million Swiss francs).
The Group has capital commitments for the purchase or construction of property, plant and
equipment totalling 1.1 billion Swiss francs (2001: 1.8 billion Swiss francs).

are traded on the London Stock Exchange and on NASDAQ Europe. The market capitalisation
asat 31 December 2002 was 59.6 million pounds (133 million Swiss francs). Following the acqui-
sition the Group will have material transactions with Antisoma for access, development, and
milestone payments with respect to its oncology product portfolio and accordingly Antisoma is
reported as an associated company. 7 million Swiss francs of goodwill arose on the acquisition,
with the balance of the acquisition price reported as an investment in associated companies.

108 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements25. Equity
Share capital
At the Annual General Meeting on 3 April 2001, the shareholders approved a 100 for 1 stock split
of the shares and non-voting equity securities of Roche Holding Ltd. The split took place on
4May 2001. The number of shares and non-voting equity securities in issue is now 160,000,000
and 702,562,700, respectively. The nominal value of the shares is now 1 Swiss franc. The non-
voting equity securities have no nominal value. All 2001 per share information has been restated
for the split as if it took place on 1 January 2001.
Based on information supplied to Roche by a shareholders’ group with pooled voting rights,
comprising Dr L. Hoffmann, Ms V. Michalski-Hoffmann, Ms M.-A. Hoffmann, Mr A. Hoffmann,
MsV. Oeri-Hoffmann, Dr A. Oeri, Ms S. Duschmalé-Oeri, Ms C. Oeri, Ms B. Oeri, Ms M. Oeri and
Dr F. Gerber, that group holds 80,020,000 shares (after the above share split) as in the preceding
year. This figure does not include any shares without pooled voting rights that are held outside
this group by individual members of the group. There were no transactions with these individuals
other than those in the ordinary course of business.
Non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
As of 31 December 2002, 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities had been issued. Under Swiss
company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value, are not part of the share
capital and cannot be issued against a contribution which would be shown as an asset in the
balance sheet of Roche Holding Ltd. Each non-voting equity security confers the same rights as
any of the shares to participate in the net profit and any remaining proceeds from liquidation
following repayment of the nominal value of the shares and, if any, participation certificates. In
accordance with the law and the Articles of Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd, the company
isentitled at all times to exchange all or some of the non-voting equity securities into shares or
participation certificates.
Dividends
On 16 April 2002 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of 1.30 Swiss francs per
share and non-voting equity security (2001: 1.15 Swiss franc) in respect of the 2001 business
year. The distribution to holders of outstanding shares and non-voting equity securities totalled
1,101 million Swiss francs (2001: 981 million Swiss francs) and has been recorded against
retained earnings in 2002.
Own equity instruments
At 31 December 2002 the number of non-voting equity securities held was 23,033,113
(2001:23,669,345). The net cash inflow from transactions in own equity instruments was
39 million Swiss francs (2001: net cash inflow of 706 million Swiss francs).
The Group holds its own equity instruments primarily to meet the obligations that may arise in
respect of certain of the Group’s debt instruments. This may be achieved by holding physical
non-voting equity securities or by holding forward contracts or derivative instruments such as call
options. At 31 December 2002 the Group held forward contracts and derivative instruments
equivalent to 17,123,740 (2001: 19,498,489) non-voting equity securities. If all of these contracts
and instruments were exercised then a total of 40,156,853 (2001: 43,167,834) non-voting equity
securities would be available to the Group.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 109The Group has partially covered its exposure to the conversion of the ‘Sumo’ Japanese yen
exchangeable bonds and fully covered its exposure to the ‘LYONs V’ zero coupon US dollar
exchangeable notes. This has been achieved using written short put options and purchased long
call options at the same strike price, which have the combined effect of a forward purchase with
a commitment of 2,971 million Swiss francs to repurchase non-voting equity securities. This is
reported within debt at its discounted present value of 2,413 million Swiss francs (see Note 29).
These transactions are supported by 673 million Swiss francs of collateral recorded as restricted
cash in financial long-term assets (see Note 17).

The ‘LYONs’ zero coupon US dollar exchangeable notes (see below) are reflected as due the first
year that the holders of the notes can request the Group to purchase the notes.
The fair value of the debt instruments is 12.6 billion Swiss francs (2001: 15.3 billion Swiss francs)
and the fair value of total long-term debt is 18.7 billion Swiss francs (2001: 19.9 billion Swiss
francs). This is calculated based upon the present value of the future cash flows on the instru-
ment, discounted at a market rate of interest for instruments with similar credit status, cash
flowsand maturity periods.
The Group’s debt is unsecured, except as noted below. The obligation arising from the Genentech
synthetic leases is supported by restricted cash of 57 million US dollars (79 million Swiss francs).
In addition, this obligation is secured on property, plant and equipment covered by the synthetic
leases which has a net book value of 860 million Swiss francs as at 31 December 2002. The
obligation to repurchase non-voting equity securities is supported by 673 million Swiss francs
ofcollateral recorded as restricted cash in financial long-term assets (see Note 17).
Amounts due to banks and other financial institutions
Interest rates on these amounts, which are primarily denominated in US dollars and euros,
average approximately 2.8% (2001: 3.7%). Repayment dates vary between 1 and 15 years.

These have been initially allocated as 3,535 million Swiss francs of debt, 1,978 million Swiss francs
of unamortised discount, 86 million Swiss francs of equity (in respect of the conversion option
embedded in the bonds) and 46 million Swiss francs ofdeferred tax liability.

Hedge accounting
The Group’s accounting policy on hedge accounting, which is described in Note 1, requires that
to qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on
documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
As described in Note 2, the Group has financial risk management policies, which cover foreign
exchange risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. When deemed appropri-
ate, certain of the above risks are altered through the use of derivatives. While many of these
transactions can be considered as hedges in economic terms, if the required conditions are not
met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instru-
ment and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship,
which means that any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in
financial income (expense).
Due to the considerable administrative cost of maintaining the necessary documentation and
tracking procedures, the Group generally limits the use of hedge accounting to certain significant
transactions. Consequently as at 31 December 2002 the Group has no fair value hedges, cash
flow hedges or hedges of net investment in a foreign entity that meet the strict requirements to
qualify for hedge accounting, apart from those described below for the Group’s subsidiary,
Genentech. These are also described in Genentech’s annual report and quarterly SEC filings.
Genentech has equity investments in various biotechnology companies that are subject to a
greater risk of market fluctuation than the stock market in general. To manage part of this expo-
sure Genentech enters into derivative financial instruments such as zero cost collars and forward
contracts. Genentech has non-US dollar cash flows from future royalty income and development
expenses expected over the next one to five years. To hedge part of this transaction exposure
Genentech enters into derivative financial instruments such as options and forward contracts.
Genentech also has anticipated cash flows from its interest-bearing investments, which are
exposed to changes in interest rates. To manage part of this risk Genentech enters into interest
rate swap agreements, which effectively convert part of the expected interest income from vari-
able to fixed rate. These swaps were terminated in 2002, when it was determined that the fore-
casted transaction was unlikely to occur, and a gain of 11 million US dollars (17 million Swiss
francs) was recognised in financial income (expense). Movements on the fair value reserve for
designated cash flow hedges are included in Note 27.

Restructuring provisions arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of
business undertaken by the Group or the manner in which business is conducted. Such provisions
include only the costs necessarily entailed by the restructuring which are not associated with
theon-going activities of the Group. The creation of such provisions is recorded as a charge
against other operating income, except where they arise from the restructuring of newly acquired
companies, in which case they are included in the acquisition accounting and hence form part
ofthe goodwill. See also Note 7 regarding the Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring.
Other provisions consist mainly of legal, environmental and similar matters. Other provisions
include provisions in respect of the vitamin case (see Note 8) and major legal cases (see Note 9).
32. Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees,
tobe affected by political, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating
to environmental protection, in the countries in which it operates. The industries in which the
Group is engaged are also subject to physical risks of various kinds. The nature and frequency of
these developments and events, not all of which are covered by insurance, as well as their
effecton future operations and earnings are not predictable.
See also Note 8 in respect of the vitamin case and Note 9 in respect of major legal cases.
116 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements33. Cash flow statement in millions of CHF
Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities are those derived from the Group’s primary activities,
asdescribed in the divisional review. This is calculated by the indirect method, by adjusting the
Group’s operating profit for any operating income and expenses that are not cash flows (for
example depreciation, amortisation and impairment) in order to derive the cash generated from
operations. This and other operating cash flows are shown in the cash flow statement. Operating
cash flows also include income taxes paid on all activities, including, for example, the taxes
paidon the gains from LabCorp share sales.

Acquisition of Disetronic
On 10 February 2003 Roche and Disetronic announced plans under which the Group would
acquire Disetronic. Disetronic is a world leader in the research, development and commercialisa-
tion of insulin pumpsand injection systems for the treatment of diabetes. It is a public company
headquartered in Burgdorf, Switzerland. After the completion of the acquisition Disetronic’s
Infusion Systems division will become part of Roche Diagnostics’ Diabetes Care business area.

and chairman and will continue to operate as an independent company.
The Group will offer shareholders of Disetronic 670 Swiss francs in cash and two Roche non-
voting equity securities for each Disetronic share. The proposed acquisition is subject to approval
from the competition authorities and by Disetronic’s shareholders. The total cost of theacqui-
sition is expected to be approximately 1.6 billion Swiss francs. The expected proceeds from the
resale of the Injection Systems division are in the order of 400 million Swiss francs.

cerning professional qualification and independence.
Our audit was conducted in accordance with auditing standards promulgated by the Swiss

CER (Constant Exchange Rates): The percentage changes at Constant Exchange Rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the 2012 and 2011
results at constant currencies (the average rates for the year ended 31 December 2011).
Core results and Core EPS (earnings per share): These exclude non-core items such as global restructuring charges and amortisation and impairment of goodwill
and intangible assets. This allows a transparent assessment of both the actual results and the underlying performance of the business. A full income statement for
the Group and the operating results of the divisions are shown on both an IFRS and core basis. The core concept is fully described on pages 146–149 and
reconciliations between the IFRS and core results are given there.Finance – 2012 in brief
Roche in 2012 The Roche Group reported strong overall results in a challenging market in 2012. Core operating
profit grew ahead of sales, and Core Earnings per Share increased by 10% at constant exchange
rates (CER). The Swiss franc was weaker at average rates against some major currencies, notably
the US dollar and Japanese yen, which had a positive overall impact on the income statement and
cash flows expressed in Swiss francs.
Sales Group sales increased by 4% (CER) to 45.5 billion Swiss francs (+7% growth in Swiss franc terms).
Pharmaceuticals sales growth was 5% (CER). The strong growth in both established and
new oncology products, Actemra/RoActemra in rheumatoid arthritis and Pegasys in virology,
was partially offset by the continuing impacts of generic competition and continuing pressures
on prices, particularly in Japan and Western Europe.
Diagnostics sales grew by 4% (CER), ahead of the market, with Professional Diagnostics and
Tissue Diagnostics being the major contributors.
Operating results Core operating profit increased by 11% (CER) to 17.2 billion Swiss francs (+13% growth in
Swiss franc terms). The sales growth, productivity improvements and cost savings from various
global restructuring plans offset the higher operating costs from investments in key markets
as well as the impacts from price pressure and increased competition. The core operating margin
increased by 2.1 percentage points to 37.7%.
Research and development expenditure remained broadly stable with a slight increase
of 2% (CER) to 8.5 billion Swiss francs on a core basis, due to strict portfolio prioritisation while
supporting the development of the pipeline. R&D costs are 18.6% of Group sales.
IFRS operating results include non-core items of 3.0 billion Swiss francs. This includes 1.3 billion
for the restructuring of the Pharmaceuticals Division’s Research and Development organisation
and the restructuring of the Diagnostics Division’s Applied Science and Diabetes Care businesses.
Non-operating results Net financial expenses increased by 0.2 billion Swiss francs to 1.8 billion Swiss francs as
lower interest expenses were more than offset by higher net foreign exchange losses and higher
losses on debt redemptions.
Net income IFRS net income increased by 1% at CER to 9.8 billion Swiss francs (+2% in Swiss franc terms),
as the strong core operating results were offset by higher restructuring charges and a higher
effective tax rate.
Core Earnings per Share increased by 10% in constant currencies (+11% in Swiss francs).
Cash flows Operating free cash flow of 15.4 billion Swiss francs, up 10% at CER due to higher operating
profit.
Free cash flow of 4.6 billion Swiss francs, up 15% at CER.
Repayment of debt is ahead of schedule with 52% of the notes and bonds issued in 2009 to
finance the Genentech transaction being repaid by the end of 2012.
Financial position Net working capital increased by 3% (CER), reflecting higher levels of inventories due to
launches and growth of key products, higher safety stock levels and increased demand in key
markets.
Net debt position improved by 5.0 billion Swiss francs to 10.6 billion Swiss francs.
Credit ratings strong: Moody’s at A1 and Standard & Poor’s upgraded to AA.
Shareholder return Dividends are proposed to increase by 8%. This will represent the 26th consecutive year
of dividend growth and will result in a pay-out ratio of 54.0%, subject to AGM approval.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) was 20% representing a combined performance of share
and non-voting equity security.ROCHE GROUP

The Roche Group’s results for 2012 reported growth in its core operating activities, with sales up by 4% and core operating
profit up by 11% at constant exchange rates and core operating margin up by 2.1 percentage points to 37.7%. Sales volume
increases, notably in the US and emerging markets such as China and Latin America, more than offset pricing pressures in
many markets. The cost of sales ratio improved by 0.9 percentage points to 25.2% of sales, driven by continuing productivity
improvements in the Pharmaceuticals Division. Operating costs were held at the necessary levels to support the future
development of the business, notably for research and development which increased slightly by 2% due to portfolio prioritisation
while supporting the development of the pipeline. This strong operating performance, partially offset by a higher tax rate,
was responsible for an increase in Core EPS of 10% at constant exchange rates. Operating free cash flow grew at 10% to
15.4 billion Swiss francs or 33.8% of sales.
In the first half of 2012 the Group initiated a number of major restructuring initiatives to position the business for the future,
notably in the Pharmaceuticals Division’s Research and Development organisation with the announcement of the closure
of the Nutley site in the US. In Diagnostics the division initiated global restructuring programmes in the Applied Science
and Diabetes Care business areas to address long-term profitability by focusing on fewer businesses and products and by
consolidating operations. Net income on an IFRS basis increased by 1% to 9.8 billion Swiss francs (+2% in Swiss francs)
as the strong operating result was offset by the large restructuring costs in 2012.
Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division rose by 5%, led by 9% growth in the oncology portfolio with sales of over 21 billion
Swiss francs. The key growth drivers were Herceptin, MabThera/Rituxan, Avastin, Actemra/RoActemra, Zelboraf and
Pegasys. The E7 key emerging markets showed growth of 14%, led by 27% sales growth in China. Diagnostics sales grew
at 4%, expanding the division’s leading market position. The major growth areas were Professional Diagnostics and Tissue
Diagnostics, while sales in Diabetes Care and Applied Science both declined.
Core operating profit increased by 11%, with the Pharmaceuticals Division growing at 13% while the Diagnostics Division
fell by 2%. Both divisions showed increases in marketing and distribution costs driven by investments in new products and
key markets, notably in the US and China. There were also increased costs for factoring which contributed towards improved
cash collections, especially in Southern Europe. Bad debt expenses decreased compared to 2011 on a Group level. The
profitability in Pharmaceuticals increased by 3.1 percentage points to 44.0% due to the sales growth, a decrease in cost of
sales from productivity improvements and portfolio prioritisation in research and development. In Diagnostics, profitability
in 2012 declined by 1.1 percentage points to 21.3% mainly due to pricing pressures in the Diabetes Care business.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2012Operating free cash flow was 15.4 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 10% compared to 2011. This reflects the continued
strong underlying cash generation of the Group’s operations while making the necessary investments to develop
the business. The increase in free cash flow was 15% to 4.6 billion Swiss francs.
In 2012 on average the Swiss franc was weaker compared to the average 2011 rates for some major currencies, notably the
US dollar and Japanese yen. The overall impact is positive on the income statement and cash flows expressed in Swiss francs
compared to the results at constant exchange rates.

Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewSales
In 2012 sales increased by 4% at constant exchange rates (+7% in Swiss francs; +1% in US dollars) to 45.5 billion Swiss
francs. Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division rose 5% with Herceptin, MabThera/Rituxan, Avastin, Actemra/RoActemra,
Zelboraf and Pegasys growing strongly. Avastin returned to growth with a 6% increase in sales. These positive results were
partially offset by the continued decline in Bonviva/Boniva and CellCept sales from generic erosion following patent expiry
and NeoRecormon/Epogin due to competition from biosimilars. In the E7 key emerging market sales in Pharmaceuticals
grew by 14%, led by 27% growth in China. The Diagnostics Division sales were 10.3 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 4%
at constant exchange rates, expanding its leading market position. The major growth area was Professional Diagnostics,
which represents half of the division’s sales and grew by 8%. Tissue Diagnostics (+12%) also showed strong growth, while
Diabetes Care sales declined by 4% and Applied Science sales by 3%.

Core operating results
Pharmaceuticals Division. The division increased its core operating profit by 13% at constant exchange rates, driven
by growth of the underlying business with a 5% increase in sales, an improved gross profit margin and contained spending.
Core research and development costs remained broadly stable with a slight 2% increase, while there was only a 2%
increase in marketing and distribution and a fall of 3% in general and administration.
Diagnostics Division. Core operating profit was down 2%, with the 4% sales increase more than offset by pricing pressures
in the Diabetes Care business. Cost of sales increased at a higher rate than sales growth due to pricing impacts and
increased placement costs following the expansion of the worldwide installed instrument base. Research and development
and marketing and distribution costs were kept in line with sales growth. There was significant growth in general and
administration costs with a base effect due to the release of a provision in 2011. As described below, the division has initiated
global restructuring plans to address the long-term profitability of the Applied Science and Diabetes Care business areas.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2012Global restructuring plans
In the first half of 2012 the Group initiated several major global restructuring plans, notably for the reorganisation of research
and development in the Pharmaceuticals Division and to address long-term profitability in the Applied Science and Diabetes
Care business areas.

1) Includes closure of the Nutley site and associated infrastructure and environmental remediation costs.
2) Includes restructuring of the Applied Science and Diabetes Care business areas.
3) Includes Operational Excellence (Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics) and dalcetrapib (Pharmaceuticals).
Pharmaceuticals Division – Research and Development reorganisation. On 26 June 2012 the Group announced
a streamlining of the research and development activities within the Pharmaceuticals Division. As part of this plan the US site
in Nutley, New Jersey, will be closed by the end of 2013, with a reduction in the workforce of approximately 1,000 people.
The research and development activities currently undertaken at Nutley will be consolidated at existing sites in Switzerland
and Germany and at the planned Translational Clinical Research Centre at the Alexandria Centre for Life Science in
Manhattan in the US. The resulting savings from the global site consolidation and related infrastructure costs, the bundling
of support functions as well as shifts in the portfolio will allow the reallocation of resources to the growing number of clinical
programmes. During 2012 costs of 885 million Swiss francs were incurred, based on latest estimates of the cost of the
reorganisation. Of this amount, 188 million Swiss francs were provisions for severance payments and other employee-related
costs, net of estimated pension curtailment gains. A charge of 381 million Swiss francs was recorded for impairments of
property, plant and equipment at the Nutley site. In addition to these restructuring costs, environmental remediation costs
of 243 million Swiss francs were booked based on the initial estimates of the additional remediation activities that may be
needed before the Nutley site can be sold. Impairment charges to intangible assets of 46 million Swiss francs were recorded
as a result of portfolio prioritisation decisions linked to this reorganisation.
Diagnostics Division – Applied Science and Diabetes Care restructuring. Initiatives were announced in 2012 for
the Applied Science and Diabetes Care businesses, which include streamlining the product portfolio, consolidating research
and development activities and increasing the efficiency of marketing and distribution operations. Costs of 180 million Swiss
francs were incurred in 2012, which relate to employee termination and site closure costs. In addition goodwill impairment
charges of 187 million Swiss francs were incurred for the full write-off of the goodwill from the 2007 NimbleGen acquisition,
resulting from the decision to exit the Microarray business as part of the reorganisation of the Applied Science business
area, as well as 29 million Swiss francs from the impairment of intangible assets in this business area.
Pharmaceuticals Division – Global Informatics reorganisation. Costs of 49 million Swiss francs were incurred,
which mainly consist of severance payments and other employee-related costs.
6
Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewOther global restructuring plans. In 2012 costs of 484 million Swiss francs were incurred for the previously announced
Operational Excellence programme, mainly for employee-related costs for sales force restructuring initiatives in the
Pharmaceuticals Division and employee-related and site closure costs in the Diagnostics Division for the sites in Burgdorf,
Switzerland and Graz, Austria. In the second quarter of 2012 the Pharmaceuticals Division initiated a detailed review
following the announcement of the results of the second interim analysis of the dalcetrapib dal-OUTCOMES Phase III trial
and the subsequent termination of the dal-OUTCOMES trial and all the studies in the dal-HEART programme. Consequently
restructuring costs of 128 million Swiss francs were incurred, which consisted of the remaining trial costs and write-offs
of inventories and property, plant and equipment. Additionally 112 million Swiss francs were expensed for the write-off of
previously acquired intangible assets.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets were 187 million Swiss francs and 525 million Swiss francs,
respectively, approximately half of which was incurred for the various global restructuring initiatives as described above.
In addition, unrelated to global restructuring plans, further impairment charges of 338 million Swiss francs were recorded.
The major elements of this amount are charges of 103 million Swiss francs following from a portfolio prioritisation decision
by the Pharmaceuticals Division, which relates to a decision to return the global rights to the monoclonal antibody RG
7334 anti-PLGF MAb to the alliance partners, and charges of 162 million Swiss francs follow from the latest clinical data
assessment of a project acquired as part of the Marcadia acquisition.
legal and environmental settlements
In addition to the environmental remediation costs of 243 million Swiss francs for the Nutley site mentioned above,
a further 146 million Swiss francs of legal and environmental costs were recorded, unrelated to global restructuring plans.
These include the estimated additional remediation costs of a landfill site near Grenzach, Germany, that was previously
used by manufacturing operations that were closed some years ago.
Treasury and taxation
Financial income was 0.5 billion Swiss francs, a decrease of 30% mainly due to foreign currency losses whereas in 2011
devaluation-related foreign exchange gains occurred in Venezuela. Financing costs were 2.3 billion Swiss francs, a decrease
of 2%, with interest costs being 8% lower at constant exchange rates as debt was repaid. Core tax expenses increased by
16% to 3.5 billion Swiss francs and the Group’s effective core tax rate increased to 22.7% compared to 21.3% in 2011. This
was mainly as a consequence of the higher percentage of core profit contribution coming from the US, which has a relatively
higher local tax rate than the average Group rate.
Net income and Earnings per share
IFRS net income increased by 2% and diluted EPS by 2% with the strong core operating performance offset by costs of
the various global restructuring plans. On a core basis, which excludes non-core items such as global restructuring costs
and amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, net income and Core EPS were 10% higher, driven by
the strong operating performance partially offset by the higher effective tax rate.
Supplementary net income and EPS information is given on pages 146–149. This includes calculations of Core EPS and
reconciles the Core results to the Group’s published IFRS results.

Compared to the start of 2012 the Swiss franc strengthened against some major currencies by the year-end, most importantly
against the US dollar and the Japanese yen. Following the intervention of the Swiss National Bank starting from the second
half of 2011, the Swiss franc was stable against the euro during 2012.
In the Pharmaceuticals Division net working capital increased by 7% at constant exchange rates. Inventories increased by
18% mainly due to inventory building to support both recent and upcoming product launches, to ensure supply for increased
sales demand and to meet business expansion in emerging markets. Receivables increased by 3%, with the impacts of
continued sales growth in US and emerging markets being partly offset by strong collection of outstanding receivables,
notably in Southern Europe. Payables were 8% higher than the previous year due to increased accrued liabilities for sales
related chargebacks, employee incentives and accrued royalties. Long-term net operating assets decreased by 8% mainly
due to the impact of global restructuring plans and lower intangible assets. In Diagnostics the net working capital decreased
by 3%. The main driver was a decrease in receivables after strong collections and factoring initiatives in Southern European
countries, which more than offset higher inventory levels due to product launches and higher safety stocks due to increasing
market demand in China and a decrease in payables. The long-term net operating assets decreased by 4% as intangible
assets decreased and additional provisions for restructuring costs were created.
The decrease in the net debt position was mainly due to the free cash flow of 4.6 billion Swiss francs. The net pension
liabilities increased by 1.6 billion Swiss francs due to continuing low interest rates increasing the discounted defined benefit
obligation. The net tax assets increased mainly due to the deferred tax effect of this increase in net pension liabilities.
Other non-operating net assets decreased by 19% due to a decrease in interest payables.

Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewThe Group’s operating free cash flow for 2012 was 15.4 billion Swiss francs, with the 11% increase in core operating
profit at constant exchange rates feeding through to a 10% increase in operating free cash flow. Cash generation in the
Pharmaceuticals Division increased by 7% to 14.1 billion Swiss francs as the strong operating results were partially offset
by increases in net working capital from the increased inventory holdings for recently launched products and additional
capital expenditure for property plant and equipment. Diagnostics operating free cash flow increased due to improved
collection of trade receivables and factoring initiatives in Southern European countries. The free cash flow in 2012 shows
an increase of 0.7 billion Swiss francs to 4.6 billion Swiss francs. This was primarily due to the 1.7 billion Swiss francs increase
in operating free cash flow which was partially offset by higher tax payments and an increase in the annual dividend.

Pharmaceuticals Division sales increased by 5% at constant exchange rates mainly due to the continuing strength of the
oncology portfolio, which grew 9%. The division benefited from strong growth in the US (+7%), China (+27%) and Brazil
(+11%). The growth in most key products offset the negative impacts from pricing pressures as well as expected decreases
in sales of some medicines due to loss of patent exclusivity and competition. Sales growth was primarily driven by six
products: Herceptin, MabThera/Rituxan, Avastin, Actemra/RoActemra, Zelboraf and Pegasys. These products represent
60% of the portfolio (2011: 57%) and together generated 2.4 billion Swiss francs of additional sales in 2012. This growth
was partly offset by lower sales of Bonviva/Boniva, NeoRecormon/Epogin, Lucentis and CellCept. Tamiflu sales increased
mainly due to the strong influenza season in the US.
Oncology continued to account for the majority of the division’s sales, with continued growth in Herceptin and MabThera/
Rituxan and a return to growth for Avastin. The recently launched Zelboraf was also a significant growth contributor.
Virology sales grew, benefiting from the continued growth of Pegasys, and higher Tamiflu sales in the US and Japan. Sales
in inflammation/autoimmune/transplantation increased due to the continuing strong uptake of Actemra/RoActemra and
growth of MabThera/Rituxan in rheumatoid arthritis more than compensating for the negative impact of continued generic
erosion of CellCept.

MabThera/Rituxan. For non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and rheumatoid arthritis
(RA). The sales growth in the oncology segment of 9% was driven by the strong uptake of the first-line maintenance
treatment of follicular lymphoma (a type of NHL) as well as first-line and relapsed/refractory CLL in the US and Western
Europe. Sales in the US were 3.1 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 8%, while sales in Western Europe rose by 6%. Sales
growth of 13% in the International region, including key emerging markets such as Russia and China, was also mainly due
to uptake in NHL indications and increased treatment share. Sales grew despite mandatory price cuts in some markets.
Sales in the RA franchise were 1.1 billion Swiss francs in 2012, an increase of 8% in constant currencies, with continued
positive impact from increased use in patients with an inadequate response to treatment with tumour necrosis factor
inhibitors.

Herceptin. For HER2-positive breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic (advanced) stomach cancer. Sales grew in all
regions, particularly in the International region where sales grew by 20% to 1.9 billion Swiss francs. Demand was especially
strong in the CEMAI (Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa, Central Asia, Indian Subcontinent) and Latin America
regions. US sales were 1.7 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 11% largely due to continued uptake for stomach cancer and
an increased availability of patients resulting from the closure of large trials in HER2 positive breast cancer. Some positive
impact from on-going efforts to improve the quality of HER2 testing is believed to have contributed to performance as well.
HER2 testing was also a key growth driver in Western Europe, where Herceptin is the Group’s leading product with sales
of 2 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 3%. Global growth was also due to programmes to help improve access in emerging
markets. Japanese sales were driven by continued uptake in the stomach cancer indication.

Avastin. For advanced colorectal, breast, lung, kidney and ovarian cancer, and for relapsed glioblastoma (a type of brain
tumour). Global sales grew by 6%, mainly due to increased use in established indications (colorectal, lung and breast
cancer) as well as the successful launch in newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer in Western Europe. Avastin received
two new EU approvals in the fourth quarter of 2012: for treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer in combination with standard
chemotherapy and for colorectal cancer treatment, continuing first-line Avastin beyond progression, in combination with
second-line chemotherapy. Overall Avastin sales in the United States were 2.5 billion Swiss francs and in the International
region growth was 16%, led by the CEMAI, Latin America and Asia–Pacific sub regions. Growth in Japan was 16% due to the
use in breast cancer, colorectal cancer and lung cancer and growth was 6% in Western Europe due to use in ovarian cancer.

Pegasys. For hepatitis B and C. Sales increased by 12% to 1.6 billion Swiss francs mainly due to the continued demand
for Pegasys in triple-combination therapy with direct-acting hepatitis C antivirals and ribavirin. In the US sales grew by
49% and in Western Europe by 3%, although sales growth slowed in the second half of the year following an initial surge.
As the leading pegylated interferon, Pegasys has established itself as a key component of the triple-combination treatment
regimen, further expanding its market share. The Pegasys pre-filled pen (ProClick in the US) has been launched in the
US and key EU markets, making administration of the medicine more convenient.

Xeloda. For colorectal, stomach and breast cancer. Sales increased by 9% to 1.5 billion Swiss francs. Growth was driven
primarily by strong demand in the US, China and Japan with increased US sales partly due to shortages of certain alternative
cancer medicines. Sales in Western Europe were impacted by government-mandated price cuts in key markets.

lucentis. For wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion
(CRVO) and diabetic macular edema (DME). Sales declined by 8% to 1.5 billion Swiss francs due to the entry of a competitor
drug to treat wAMD and CRVO. The recent launch of Lucentis to treat DME is on track and the uptake is partly offsetting
the decline in wAMD and CRVO. Roche also filed a supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for 0.5mg pro re nata
(PRN) dosing in wAMD, which, if approved, will allow the promotion of less-than-monthly dosing.

Tarceva. For advanced non-small cell lung (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer. Sales rose by 2%, with growth in US, Brazil,
China and Japan offsetting a decline in Western Europe that can be attributed to shorter treatment durations and a slight
decrease in patient share in second-line NSCLC. Western European sales stabilised in the fourth quarter and regulatory
filings were submitted for the approval of Tarceva in first-line epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive
NSCLC in both the US and China. The US submission has been granted priority review, with an FDA decision expected
in the second quarter of 2013.

CellCept. For the prevention of solid organ transplant rejection. Sales again declined in 2012 due to continued generic
erosion in the US and Western Europe following patent expiry in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Sales in many countries of
the International region were also negatively affected by price pressure and increased use of generics, but sales grew
in China. Continued growth in Japan reflects the position of CellCept as the standard of care in its approved indications.

Actemra/RoActemra. For rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Sales continued to grow
strongly in all approved indications and in all regions except Japan, where volume growth was offset by government price
cuts. Sales increased particularly in the US and Western Europe, where Actemra/RoActemra continues to gain market share.
Marketing and reimbursement approvals in additional countries continue to expand patient access to Actemra/RoActemra.
Physicians increasingly see Actemra/RoActemra as the preferred drug for monotherapy in rheumatoid arthritis following the
positive results of the ADACTA trial that showed superiority against adalimumab in this setting.

NeoRecormon/Epogin. For anemia/renal anemia. In a highly competitive market the Group’s overall market share in
the anemia franchise, including Mircera, was only slightly down for the year. Combined sales of Roche’s NeoRecormon and
Chugai’s Epogin (epoetin beta) declined 26%. In the Western Europe and International regions sales were lower due to
increasing biosimilar competition and a market decline in the cancer–related anemia segment, while competitive pressure
and a lower reimbursement price resulted in reduced sales of Epogin in Japan.
The sustained decline in sales of NeoRecormon and Epogin was partly offset by growth in sales of the longer-acting
erythropoiesis-stimulating agent Mircera, which rose 8% to 384 million Swiss francs. Much of this growth is due to
the increasing number of patients switching to or starting treatment with Mircera in place of NeoRecormon/Epogin.
The strongest contributions to higher Mircera sales came from Japan, where the product was launched in July 2011.

Bonviva/Boniva. For osteoporosis. The significant decrease in the US reflects falling market demand and entry of generics
into the market. Sales in Western Europe were lower due to the continued impact of generics into the market together with
pricing and reimbursement issues. The growth of 58% in the Asia–Pacific sub region was led by South Korea. However, this
was more than offset by lower sales in the rest of the International region as the product was used less in competitor clinical
studies.

Tamiflu. For influenza A and B. Sales increased in 2012 mainly due to US sales for seasonal use in the last quarter of the
year following the strong and widespread influenza season. Sales were also higher in Japan in 2012. This was partly offset by
lower annual sales for pandemic stockpiling, which primarily related to the replacement of expiring pandemic stockpiles.

Zelboraf. For BRAF V600E-mutation-positive metastatic melanoma. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
Zelboraf in August 2011. The FDA simultaneously approved Roche Diagnostics’ cobas BRAF V600 Mutation Test, a companion
diagnostic used to identify patients for whom treatment with Zelboraf is appropriate. Zelboraf is now approved in more than
40 countries. Sales were driven by the continued uptake in the US, reflecting the high unmet medical need in metastatic
melanoma, and also by the strong uptake in Western Europe following approval at the start of 2012.

United States. Sales grew by 7% in US dollar terms. The leading products were the oncology medicines MabThera/Rituxan
(+8%), Avastin (+0%) and Herceptin (+11%), with sales of 3.1 billion Swiss francs, 2.5 billion Swiss francs and 1.7 billion
Swiss francs respectively. Pegasys (+49%), Activase/TNKase (+23%), Actemra/RoActemra (+62%), Zelboraf (+252%) and
Xeloda (+15%) also boosted growth and compensated for the expected declines in Bonviva/Boniva, Lucentis and CellCept.
Sales of Tamiflu increased, with a positive impact on sales growth of approximately 1 percentage point.
Western Europe. Sales decreased by 2% in constant currencies mainly due to generic competition for Bonviva/Boniva and
CellCept as well as price pressure from government austerity measures and budget constraints. There was higher demand
for the oncology products Avastin (+6%), MabThera/Rituxan (+6%) and Herceptin (+3%), which accounted for total sales of
5.1 billion Swiss francs. The launch of Zelboraf was also successful. There was further uptake of Actemra/RoActemra which
was offset by price pressures. Sales of Mircera and NeoRecormon in the highly competitive renal anemia market were also
lower.
Japan. Sales grew by 2% in Japanese yen terms. This was achieved in spite of government price cuts which had a negative
impact on sales of approximately 6 percentage points. The major growth drivers were Mircera (+203%) and Avastin (+16%).
MabThera/Rituxan sales rose by 8% and Tamiflu sales by 38%. Sales of Epogin fell 50% mainly due to patient treatment
switching to Mircera.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2012International. Sales rose 9% driven by strong growth in Latin America, Asia–Pacific and CEMAI. Growth in Latin America
was mainly due to oncology products, in particular Herceptin (+25%), Avastin (+13%) and MabThera/Rituxan (+7%). Sales
growth was particularly strong in Brazil and Argentina. Higher demand for MabThera/Rituxan (+19%), Herceptin (+14%)
and Xeloda (+18%) lifted sales in Asia–Pacific. China remains the main driver in this region, with overall sales growth of 27%.
Sales growth in the CEMAI was mainly due to increased Herceptin, MabThera/Rituxan and Avastin sales, driven in part by
tender sales in Algeria and Russia. Sales in Mexico decreased due to biosimilar competition to MabThera/Rituxan. Total sales
in the E7 key emerging markets grew by 14%.

the disposal income came from the disposal of Rocaltrol ampoules in Japan and the rights for Ostac, Vesanoid and Rohypnol
in certain markets. These increases were partly offset by lower income from out-licensing agreements.

Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewCore costs decreased by 3% at constant exchange rates due to lower manufacturing costs and royalty expenses. As a
percentage of sales, cost of sales declined to 20.1% (2011: 21.5%). The 5% decrease in manufacturing cost of goods sold and
period costs was mainly due to productivity improvements and product mix effects. Royalty expenses were 9% lower, driven
by a decline in royalty expenses related to sales of Bonviva/Boniva and CellCept and the 2011 back royalty expenses related
to the Rituxan arbitration. Expenses from collaboration and profit-sharing agreements increased, mainly driven by higher
co-promotion expenses due to higher sales of MabThera/Rituxan, Tarceva and Xolair in the US. Global restructuring costs
relate mostly to write-offs of property, plant and equipment and other manufacturing costs related to production network
rationalisation and the dalcetrapib trial termination.

Core costs increased at constant exchange rates by 2% and as a percentage of sales, costs fell to 16.6% (2011: 16.9%).
Sales and marketing efforts focussed on driving growth in emerging markets, the oncology portfolio, including the extension
of Avastin in the ovarian cancer indication, the new Pegasys triple-combination therapy and the product launches of Zelboraf,
Perjeta and Erivedge. The increase was also partly due to initiatives assisting patient access to healthcare. Significantly lower
costs were incurred for bad debt expenses compared to 2011. Global restructuring costs primarily related to sales force
restructuring initiatives.

Core costs increased by 2% at constant exchange rates. Research and development costs as a percentage of sales were
lower at 21.4% compared to 21.9% in 2011. There were increased investments in central nervous system, mostly due to the
ramp-up of studies in bitopertin and ocrelizumab MS, and the increasing number of programmes for Alzheimer’s disease.
These were partially offset by lower life cycle investments in inflammation and oncology due to the decision to discontinue
inflammation research in Nutley and the discontinuation of Avastin adjuvant breast cancer studies in 2011. In addition the
Pharmaceuticals Division spent 209 million Swiss francs on the in-licensing of pipeline compounds and technologies, which
are capitalised as intangible assets. In total the division spent 7.7 billion Swiss francs on internal and purchased research and
development from in-licensing and other alliance deals. The 2012 impairments of intangible assets include 112 million Swiss
francs from the decision to stop further development activities on dalcetrapib, 103 million Swiss francs from the returning
of the global rights to the monoclonal antibody RG 7334 anti-PLGF MAb to the alliance partners and also 162 million
Swiss francs from the latest clinical data assessment of a project acquired as part of the Marcadia acquisition. In addition
99 million Swiss francs of impairment charges arose as a result of portfolio prioritisation decisions and following recent clinical
data. Global restructuring costs include 208 million Swiss francs of employee-related costs and 75 million Swiss francs
of property plant and equipment impairments related to the closure of the Nutley site and 91 million Swiss francs following
the dalcetrapib trial termination, which consists of provisions for remaining trial costs and write-offs of inventories. Other
restructuring costs of 115 million Swiss francs mainly relate to site closure and other costs resulting from the Operational
Excellence programme.

Core costs decreased by 3% at constant exchange rates. General and administration expenses as a percentage of sales
decreased by 0.2 percentage points to 3.0%. Administration costs decreased due to strict cost containment and some
organisational shifts to the corporate functions. Business taxes increased mainly driven by favourable tax credits in 2011.
Global restructuring costs relate to the site closure costs for Nutley, mainly impairments of property, plant and equipment,
and the division’s global informatics restructuring programme. The release of the provision for contingent consideration
from the Marcadia acquisition resulted in a net income for alliance and business combination costs.

Pharmaceuticals Division total core operating profit and operating profit both include the elimination of 38 million Swiss francs (2011: 85 million Swiss francs)
of unrealised inter-company profits between Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai.
Sales increased in both sub-divisions. In constant currencies sales and core operating profit of Roche Pharmaceuticals
increased significantly with sales and gross profit growing more than operating expenses. Sales by Chugai also grew, as well
as Chugai core operating profit which increased despite a lower gross margin, due to product mix effects. The growth in
the core operating margin was due to strict cost containment in all operating expenses.

The absolute amount of the movement between the 2012 and 2011 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2012 transactions
(translated at average rates for 2011) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2012 transactions include non-cash movements
and therefore the movements in this table are not the same as amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only includes the cash movements). A full
consolidated balance sheet is given on page 47 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given
above is on page 151.
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of 2012 the Swiss franc strengthened
against some major currencies by the year-end, most importantly against the US dollar and the Japanese yen. Following the
intervention of the Swiss National Bank starting from the second half of 2011, the Swiss franc was stable against the euro
during 2012.
Net working capital. The increase of 7% at constant exchange rates was mainly due to an increase in inventories. The
balance sheet value of inventories increased mainly due to inventory building to support the recent launches and continuing
approvals for new products such as Zelboraf, Perjeta and Erivedge and in preparation for upcoming launches such as T-DM1
and MabThera subcutaneous formulation. Higher inventory levels were also driven by the need to ensure supply for the
increased sales demand and business expansion in emerging markets. Receivables increased with sales growth in the US,
in particular with the timing of strong Tamiflu sales towards year end, and with the continued growth of the business in China,
Latin America and CEMAI. In addition royalty receivables increased due to higher Lucentis and other product royalties.
These effects were partly offset by strong collections of outstanding receivables from some Southern European countries.
Payables increased mainly due to increased accrued liabilities for sales related chargebacks, employee incentives and
accrued royalties.
long-term net operating assets. These decreased by 8% at constant exchange rates mainly due to the impact of the global
restructuring programmes and impairments of intangible assets. The significant majority of these were recorded in the first
half of 2012. Impairments of property, plant and equipment were made in respect of the Nutley site closure and provisions
were made for the employee-related costs of both the Nutley site closure and global informatics reorganisation. Intangibles
decreased mainly due to impairments in respect of dalcetrapib, the portfolio prioritisation decision regarding the monoclonal
antibody RG 7334 anti-PLGF MAb, the impairment of a project acquired as part of the Marcadia acquisition and other
impairment charges related to portfolio prioritisation and clinical data.

1) A detailed breakdown is provided on page 150.
The Pharmaceuticals Division’s operating free cash flow increased to 14.1 billion Swiss francs. The increased cash generation
from the underlying business was partly offset by increases in net working capital and higher investments in property, plant
and equipment. These investments included the continuing site development plans in Switzerland and China, the construction
of new production and research and development facilities by Chugai and the enhancement and expansion of various
production and distribution facilities in the US and Switzerland, including advanced technology quality control laboratories.
Receivables increased but at a lower level than in 2011. Cash invested in inventories increased further due to launch and
pre-launch preparations for new products and ensuring supply for continued sales growth in both the US and key growth
markets, such as Asia–Pacific, especially China and Latin America.
There was an increase in the cash outflow from equity compensation plans in 2012, as the increase in the Roche share price
led to increasing levels of exercising of employee stock options.

Sales
Diagnostics Division sales continued to increase ahead of the in vitro diagnostics (IVD) global market with a growth of
4% at constant exchange rates. Professional Diagnostics, with 8% sales growth, was the main growth contributor led by
its Immunodiagnostics business. Tissue Diagnostics sales grew by 12% driven by the advanced staining business. Both
business areas grew substantially ahead of their respective markets. Diabetes Care sales decreased by 4% mainly due to
reimbursement changes in Europe and difficult market conditions. Sales in Molecular Diagnostics increased by 4% led by
the blood screening business and HCV monitoring. Applied Science sales decreased by 3% due to increasing competition
in sequencing and a slowdown in public research funding.

Professional Diagnostics. Sales grew at about double the rate of the global market. The business area strengthened its
leading position in the professional diagnostics market which includes IVD products for clinical laboratories and near patient
testing. The primary growth driver was again the immunoassay business (+15%). Roche Diagnostics enjoys competitive
advantage from its menu of over 100 different tests, the broadest in the industry for an instrument series. Clinical chemistry
solutions for laboratories, the second largest part of the business, saw continued demand (+5%). Instrument placements
in both areas increased by 13%, due to strong demand in the emerging markets as well as increased supply by our partner
Hitachi High Technology after the effects of the East Japan Earthquake in 2011. In the Point of Care business growth was
driven by coagulation monitoring devices where the 8% sales growth was above the market.
From a regional view, growth mainly came from emerging markets. This was led by the Asia–Pacific region (+22%) and
particularly China (+35%), and the Latin America region (+16%). Professional Diagnostics also grew ahead of the market in
EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and North America, with particularly increased market penetration in North America
supported through a number of key launches.
The business further strengthened its menu of tests, with launches of four immunoassays in various markets including
Vitamin D in the US. The Vitamin D test has seen a strong market uptake worldwide with over 7 million tests in the 19 months
since it was first launched in the EU. Professional Diagnostics also introduced three systems for near patient testing in
the hospital or at the physician’s office. These are the cobas b 123 (blood gas) and Accu-Chek Inform II (blood glucose),
both of which have been launched in the US, and the cobas b 101 (blood lipid/glucose) which has been launched in the EU.
New IT systems and the cobas p 312, a new pre-analytics system automating preparatory steps in the laboratory, were also
launched.

Diabetes Care. Sales declined by 4% due to reimbursement cuts for blood glucose monitoring supplies in major European
markets, including Germany, France and Poland, and intensified pressure on prices. There was also increasing competition
from low-cost providers, particularly in the US, where Roche Diabetes Care launched its new Accu-Chek portfolio in 2012.
Overall sales declined in North America by 4%. In the rest of the world growth was driven by Latin America (+12%). While
the blood glucose monitoring segment declined by 5% over the year, sales of insulin delivery systems were up 8%, mainly due
to the increased market uptake of the FlexLink infusion system.
In 2012 the business introduced two products in the US, which both showed promising market uptake: the blood glucose
monitoring system Accu-Chek Nano SmartView in April and the meter-pump combination Accu-Chek Combo system in
October. Diabetes Care also continued the launch of the next-generation Accu-Chek Mobile system in the EU and Japan.
This is now available in 17 countries and growing by 26%.
24
Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewIn July 2012 the Diabetes Care business unit initiated a restructuring to secure long-term profitability, with measures taken
in research and development, marketing and distribution and manufacturing activities. The business also re-allocated
R&D investments to continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps which are expected to have the best market potential
for differentiated products.

Molecular Diagnostics. Roche Molecular Diagnostics retained its leadership position in the global molecular diagnostics
market holding one third of the global market. Sales growth was driven by the blood screening business (+5%), the HPV
(cervical cancer screening) and Microbiology businesses (+11%) and virology testing (+2%), which was led by demand for
HCV Monitoring.
Regionally, growth was driven by North America (+8%), primarily due to HCV Monitoring and HPV testing. In EMEA,
growth in blood screening particularly in the Middle East was partly offset by lower virology sales due to price pressure.
In the rest of the world, Asia–Pacific (+13%) and particularly China (+49%) performed well.
The cobas HPV test for cervical cancer screening continued its positive uptake in the EU and the US, with 86 new contracts
signed in the US in 2012. The business area also expanded its instrument portfolio in the US with a pre-analytical system
and launched three new or next-generation tests for chlamydia/gonorrhoea, cytomegalovirus and HIV. Five new internal and
two external programmes were started for the development of companion diagnostics, adding to the close to 50 on-going
collaborations.

Total sales 737 740 –3 100 100
Applied Science. Sales declined by 3% primarily affected by subdued public research funding and increasing competition
in gene sequencing. The main sales decline was Genomics sales (sequencing and microarrays) which were 19% lower
than 2011. Partly offsetting this was growth in Applied Science’s two market leading businesses – qPCR&NAP (instruments
and reagents for the detection, quantification and purification of nucleic acids) and Custom Biotech (raw materials, reagents
and analytic systems for the healthcare industry), which increased by 5% and 8% respectively. In the rest of the world the
increases in qPCR&NAP and Custom Biotech led to growth, driven by Latin America (+6%).
From June 2012 onwards, under a restructuring initiative, Applied Science has been consolidating its product segments
to focus on those with the greatest market potential. As a consequence, it has streamlined its cellular analysis portfolio,
exited the NimbleGen microarray business, while keeping NimbleGen’s sequence capture product line, and closed the site
in Reykjavik, Iceland.
25
Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2012Roche Applied Science continued to invest in sequencing as a focus area. In the fourth quarter of 2012 it launched new
software for its GS FLX+ sequencing system for enhanced long-read performance, introduced further sequence capture
products and started a collaboration with PSS for an automated emulsion PCR instrument to improve the sequencing
workflow. The business also expanded its Custom Biotech and qPCR portfolio with a new bioprocess analyser, Cedex Bio HT
for biopharmaceutical manufacturing, and the LightCycler 96 qPCR instrument. The LightCycler 96 saw a very positive uptake
with close to 100 instruments sold within two months.

Tissue Diagnostics. Sales grew substantially ahead of the market at 12%, expanding the business’ market leadership
position in tissue-based cancer diagnostics in all regions. In North America sales were driven by instrument placements,
reagent growth and new instrument launches, which were partially offset by recent changes in reimbursement codes and
College of American Pathologists’ guidelines to reduce the use of negative reagent controls. Roche Tissue Diagnostics’
sales growth in the other regions reflects increasing market penetration and rising demand for automated tissue diagnostics
solutions particularly in emerging markets.
Advanced staining (systems and reagents for pathology labs to detect proteins and genes in tissue samples) remained the
primary growth driver with a sales increase of 13%, due to increasing reagent sales as well as placements of the BenchMark
series of instruments. This was supported by the Companion Diagnostics business which more than doubled its revenues
through research on diagnostic biomarkers and product development work for partners in the pharmaceuticals industry.
In 2012 the business initiated ten new companion diagnostic projects with partners.
In 2012 Roche Tissue Diagnostics launched the BenchMark Special Stains platform and the VENTANA iScan HT scanner,
both with positive market uptake, together accounting for more than 170 placements. The business also expanded its
advanced staining menu with 12 new immunohistochemistry (IHC) reagents, including tests for lung, pancreatic and prostate
cancer. One of these is ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) IHC, a key companion diagnostic which was launched in October
2012 in the EU in parallel with Pfizer’s crizotinib to select patients likely to benefit from this lung cancer drug.

Divisional sales growth was primarily driven by Asia–Pacific and Latin America. In these regions Professional Diagnostics
continued to be the main growth driver, with substantial increases in Diabetes Care in Latin America. North America saw
growth of the clinical laboratory business (Professional, Tissue and Molecular Diagnostics) and the creation of further
growth momentum with the launch of over 40 major products in the US in 2012. In Japan sales grew at three times the rate
of the market, driven by Professional Diagnostics. In the EMEA region austerity measures and price pressure were felt in
major European markets. This particularly impacted the Diabetes Care business, while Professional and Tissue Diagnostics
continued to grow sales and gain market share.

The sales growth in the E7 emerging markets was led by China, with substantial contributions from Brazil, India and Russia.
The 26% growth in China was driven by the government’s continued efforts to improve the healthcare system, along with
the Roche Diagnostics’ investments to strengthen its market presence and expand its customer base beyond very large
cities and hospitals. The growth in Brazil came from continued success with major public and private tenders for laboratory
solutions, and in India from a major public contract in Diabetes Care and growth in the laboratory business.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2012Cost of sales increased by 6% at constant exchange rates on a core basis primarily due to a 5% increase in manufacturing
cost of goods sold and period costs. While previous cost reduction initiatives continued to have a positive impact, this effect
was more than offset by an increase in period costs driven by higher depreciation and placement and installation costs for
new instruments. Manufacturing cost of goods sold increased due to changes in the product mix and an increase in the
overall installed instrument base. Instrument placements were up by 13% in the Clinical Chemistry and Immunology businesses
driven by strong customer demand and partly due to the installation of instruments sourced from Hitachi High Technologies
that had been subject to supply disruptions following the East Japan Earthquake in March 2011. The increase in royalty
expenses was due to higher sales of products with in-licensed intellectual property. Overall the cost growth on a core basis
was above sales growth resulting in a higher cost of sales ratio of 42.3% (2011: 41.7%). Global restructuring costs were
incurred mainly due to costs related to the closure of the Graz and Burgdorf sites and reorganisations in the Applied Science
and Diabetes Care businesses. Amortisation of product intangibles decreased as some intangible assets were fully amortised
during 2011.

The increase of 4% at constant exchange rates on a core basis mainly reflects higher costs in Professional and Molecular
Diagnostics driven by sales force increases in China and factoring costs related to the reduction of outstanding trade
receivables in Southern Europe for the whole division. On a core basis marketing and distribution costs as a percentage
of sales remained at 24.7%. Global restructuring costs were incurred mainly due to the reorganisations in the Applied
Science business.

Core costs increased by 4% at constant exchange rates. This was driven by the development of new immunoassays and tests
in Professional Diagnostics, the cobas 6800/8800 platform in Molecular Diagnostics and instruments in Tissue Diagnostics.
These increases were partially offset by cost savings in Applied Science and Diabetes Care. As a percentage of sales,
research and development costs were stable at 9.2%. Global restructuring costs were mainly due to costs related to the
Operational Excellence programme and the reorganisation in the Diabetes Care business.

Costs increased by 21% at constant exchange rates on a core basis. The 7% cost increase in administration was mainly driven
by investments in various efficiency initiatives, mostly consisting of IT costs, and the formation of new sales and distribution
entities during 2012. Costs in other general items increased compared to 2011 with a base effect due to the income from
the release of a provision for royalties. As a percentage of sales, costs increased by 0.6 percentage points to 3.9%. Global
restructuring costs were mainly due to employee-related costs arising from the Graz transfer and to a smaller extent in the
Applied Science business area. In addition, goodwill impairment charges of 187 million Swiss francs were incurred for the full
write-off of the goodwill from the NimbleGen acquisition, resulting from the decision to exit the Microarrays business as part
of the reorganisation of the Applied Science business area.

The absolute amount of the movement between the 2012 and 2011 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2012 transactions
(translated at average rates for 2011) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2012 transactions include non-cash movements
and therefore the movements in this table are not the same as amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only include the cash movements). A full
consolidated balance sheet is given on page 47 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given
above is on page 151.
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of 2012 the Swiss franc strengthened
against some major currencies by the year-end, most importantly against the US dollar and the Japanese yen. Following the
intervention of the Swiss National Bank starting from the second half of 2011, the Swiss franc was stable against the euro
during 2012.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2012Net working capital. Net working capital decreased by 3% at constant exchange rates as increases in inventories and
decreases in payables have been more than offset by a reduction of receivables. Inventory increases were due to the launch
and growth of key products in Professional Diagnostics and Tissue Diagnostics, higher safety stock levels in Asia Pacific
(mainly South Korea, China and Vietnam) due to increasing market demand and the establishment of a Middle-East Hub. The
main factors for the decreases in receivables are strong collections and factoring initiatives in Southern European countries,
and all regions except North America show a reduction in receivables ratios compared to 2011. Payables decreased by 5%
compared to the end of 2011 due to lower accruals and lower trade payables.
long-term net operating assets. The decrease of 4% at constant exchange rates was due to a decrease in intangible assets
due to the NimbleGen goodwill impairment and increases in provisions, mainly due to global restructuring plans. Property,
plant and equipment increased as additions, especially due to high instrument placements in China, were only partially offset
by depreciation.

The operating free cash flow of the Diagnostics Division increased by 43% at constant exchange rates despite a decline
of the operating profit. This was primarily due to a lower increase in net working capital in 2012 compared to 2011. The strong
collection of trade receivables and cash received from factoring initiatives resulted in a decrease in receivables. The higher
inventory levels resulted from the launch and growth of key products in Professional Diagnostics and Tissue Diagnostics,
higher safety stock levels in Asia Pacific (mainly South Korea, China and Vietnam) due to increasing market demand and the
establishment of a Middle-East Hub. Payables decreased due to lower accruals and lower trade payables. Capital expenditure
for property, plant and equipment increased by 11%, mainly driven by investments in China. In total the operating free cash
flow margin increased by 4.9 percentage points.

General and administration costs increased by 17% at constant exchange rates as a result of the shift of certain functions
from the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics Divisions to Corporate and increased human resources and informatics costs from
various initiatives. Total costs on an IFRS basis grew due to increased environmental provisions of 243 million Swiss francs
as an initial estimate of the costs of the additional remediation activities that may be needed at the Nutley site in the US prior
to it being sold. Further environmental costs were for the estimated additional remediation costs of a landfill site near
Grenzach, Germany, that was previously used by manufacturing operations that were closed some years ago. Further details
of these matters are given in Notes 7 and 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Corporate operating free cash flow showed an increase in the net outflow driven by the higher administration expenses
described above.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2012Foreign exchange impact on operating results
The Group’s exposure to movements in foreign currencies affecting its operating results, as expressed in Swiss francs, is
summarised by the following key figures and comments.

In 2012 on average the Swiss franc was weaker compared to the average 2011 rates for many currencies including the
US dollar and Japanese yen, but stronger against some others, notably the euro and Brazilian real. The overall impact is
positive on the income statement and cash flows expressed in Swiss francs compared to the results at constant exchange
rates. For sales these developments resulted in a positive impact of 3 percentage points, equivalent to 1.1 billion Swiss
francs when translated into Swiss francs. The currency translation exposure for the operating profit is mitigated by the
Group having the majority of its cost base located outside of Switzerland. Core operating profit increased in Swiss francs by
13% compared to an increase of 11% at constant exchange rates. This positive impact of 2 percentage points is equivalent
to 0.4 billion Swiss francs. The sensitivity of Group sales and core operating profit to a 1% movement in average foreign
currency exchange rates against the Swiss franc during 2012 is shown in the table below.

The Group’s revenues are primarily generated from sales of products to customers. Such revenues are mainly received
in the local currency of the customer’s home market, although in certain emerging markets invoicing is made in major
international currencies such as the US dollar and euro. The costs of sales and marketing and also some administration costs
follow the same currency pattern as sales. The majority of research and development activities are incurred at the Group’s
global research facilities, and therefore the costs are more concentrated in US dollars, Swiss francs and euros. General and
administration costs tend to be incurred mainly at central locations in the US, Switzerland and Germany. Obviously the large
majority of Chugai’s costs are denominated in Japanese yen.

Financial income
Financial income was 471 million Swiss francs, a decrease of 30% compared to 2011. Interest income and income from debt
securities were 32 million Swiss francs, a decrease of 55% due to the low prevailing interest rates during 2012. The net foreign
exchange result reflects hedging costs and was a loss of 89 million Swiss francs compared to a gain of 20 million Swiss francs
in 2011. Net income from equity securities was 38 million Swiss francs, down by 44%. Expected returns on pension plan assets
were 514 million Swiss francs, which was broadly in line with 2011. A full analysis of financial income is given in Note 4 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
33
Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2012Financing costs
Financing costs were 2,273 million Swiss francs, a decrease of 2% compared to 2011. The main driver was an 8% decrease in
interest expenses which reflects the continued repayment of the debt incurred to finance the Genentech transaction. Financing
costs also include 259 million Swiss francs for the loss on the combined repurchase of 975 million euros of notes that were due
4 March 2013, 650 million euros of notes that were due 4 March 2016 and the exercise of the Group’s option to call for early
redemption of 1.75 billion US dollars of notes that were due 1 March 2014. The comparative period in 2011 contained 172 million
Swiss francs for the loss on early redemption of debt. The interest cost of pension plans remained largely stable at 576 million
Swiss francs. A full analysis of financing costs is given in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income taxes
The Group’s effective core tax rate increased by 1.4 percentage points to 22.7% in 2012 (2011: 21.3%). The main reason for
the increase of the effective tax rate was the higher percentage core profit contribution from the US, which has a relatively
higher local tax rate than the average Group rate.
A tax benefit of 930 million Swiss francs was recorded for the non-core items described above compared to a tax benefit
of 554 million Swiss francs in 2011. The increase was primarily due to the higher tax benefit resulting from the global
restructuring plans including intangible asset impairments as well as legal and environmental costs as compared to 2011,
partially offset by the tax effects of the costs resulting from the 2011 East Japan Earthquake.
Full details of the Group’s income tax positions are given in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financial position
The decrease in the net debt position was due to the increased operating free cash flow which more than offset the higher
tax payments and the increase in the annual dividend, as is more fully described in the net debt section below. The increase
in net pension liabilities reflects falling interest rates leading to the discounted defined benefit obligation being higher.
The net tax assets increased mainly due to the deferred tax effect of the increased net pension liabilities. The net derivative
position increased to a net asset of 0.3 billion Swiss francs, mainly due to higher valuations on the cross-currency swaps
following a stronger euro compared to the US dollar. Interest payable relates mostly to bonds and notes with coupon
payment dates in March and September, and the decline is mostly due to the on-going debt redemptions. At 31 December
2012 the Group held financial long-term assets with a market value of 0.3 billion Swiss francs, which consist mostly of
holdings in biotechnology companies which were acquired in the context of licensing transactions or scientific
collaborations.
Free cash flow
The cash outflow from treasury activities remained stable at 1.5 billion Swiss francs. Total taxes paid were 3.3 billion Swiss
francs, an increase of 25% at constant exchange rates. This was due to higher tax payments in the United States and at
Chugai and the settlement of certain outstanding tax positions. Total dividends paid were 5.9 billion Swiss francs, an increase
of 0.1 billion Swiss francs compared to 2011, reflecting the 3% increase of the Roche Group dividend.

Operating free cash flow increased by 10% at constant exchange rates to 15.4 billion Swiss francs, mainly due to the continued
growth of the underlying operating business, which showed an 11% increase in core operating profit. In Pharmaceuticals
the strong operating results were partially offset by increases in net working capital and higher investments in property, plant
and equipment. Diagnostics operating free cash flow increased significantly due to improved collection of trade receivables
and factoring initiatives in Southern European countries.
The cash outflow from treasury activities remained stable at 1.5 billion Swiss francs. Total taxes paid were 3.3 billion Swiss
francs, an increase due to higher tax payments in the United States and at Chugai and the settlement of certain outstanding
tax positions. Total dividends paid were also higher due to the 3% increase of the annual Roche Group dividend.
Free cash flow of 4.6 billion Swiss francs is 0.7 billion Swiss francs higher than in 2011. The increase was due to the growth
in the operating free cash flow partly offset by higher tax and dividend payments.

1) US dollar-denominated debt includes those bonds and notes denominated in euros, Swiss francs and pounds sterling that were swapped into US dollars,
and therefore in the financial statements have economic characteristics equivalent to US dollar-denominated bonds and notes.
The net debt position of the Group at 31 December 2012 was 10.6 billion Swiss francs, a decrease of 5.0 billion Swiss francs from
31 December 2011. The decrease in net debt was mainly due to the free cash flow of 4.6 billion Swiss francs described above.
When issuing the debt to finance the Genentech transaction, the Group entered into derivative contracts with third parties to
hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from bonds and notes issued in currencies other than US dollar. The total exposure
hedged at issuance of these bonds and notes was approximately 25 billion Swiss francs. Collateral agreements were entered
with the derivative counterparties to mitigate counterparty risk. During 2012 cash collateral of 0.2 billion Swiss francs was
delivered to Roche. This increased the cash collateral balance of 0.2 billion Swiss francs at the start of the year to 0.4 billion
Swiss francs at 31 December 2012. The collateral balance in relation to the hedges on the non-US dollar-denominated bonds
and notes is mainly sensitive to the foreign exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro, but also to pound sterling.
Currently the collateral balance moves by approximately 90 million US dollars if all of these foreign exchange rates move by 1%
simultaneously. Collateral volatility will decrease to less than 50 million US dollars for each 1% movement in foreign exchange
rates by mid-2013 as a significant portion of the non-US dollar-denominated bonds and notes will have been repaid by this time.
36
Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewThe redemption and repurchase of bonds and notes and also the issuance of new bonds and notes during 2012, as described
in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, had a direct impact on liquid funds. However, this had no material
impact on the net debt position.
Full details of the Group’s marketable securities, cash and debt positions are given in Notes 19, 20 and 26 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefit plans are classified as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate
fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions.
In 2012 expenses for the Group’s defined contribution plans were 313 million Swiss francs (2011: 303 million Swiss francs).
All other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’, even if the Group’s potential obligation is minor or has a relatively
remote possibility of arising. The funding and asset management of the Group’s various defined benefit plans is overseen
at a corporate level. Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by payments from the
Group and by employees, but in some cases the plan is unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly
from its own financial resources.

Funding status. Overall the funding status on an IFRS basis of the Group’s defined benefit plans decreased to 81%
compared to 85% at the start of the year. This decrease came mainly from an increase in the defined benefit obligation arising
from a fall in discount rates in comparison to the end of 2011. Plan assets increased, with company contributions increasing
to 307 million Swiss francs in 2012, compared to 293 million Swiss francs in 2011. The Group continues to closely monitor the
funded status of its major pension funds. In addition to cash injections, the Group has initiated plan changes in several local
pension plans, with, for example, some of the major pension funds removing early retirement incentives. The Group continues
to introduce more flexible retirement models to better accommodate the diverse needs of an ageing workforce.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2012Expenses recorded in income statement. Total pension expenses in 2012 relating to the Group’s defined benefit plans
were 342 million Swiss francs compared to 399 million Swiss francs in 2011. The decrease of 14% is primarily due to higher
curtailment gains of 76 million Swiss francs related to Nutley restructuring compared to 15 million Swiss francs of curtailment
gains in 2011. Based on the revised actuarial assumptions at the end of 2012, total pension expenses for 2013 are expected to
be approximately 240 million Swiss francs higher than 2012. The increase is mainly driven by application of IAS 19 (revised),
which will increase the net interest cost of pensions by approximately 160 million Swiss francs. There will also be an increase
of approximately 75 million Swiss francs in the current service cost driven by a fall in the discount rates during 2012. These
estimates for 2013 pension expenses do not include any curtailment or past service effects that might arise during the year.
Full details of the Group’s pensions and other post-employment benefits are given in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

In 2012 Roche ranked number 5 among a peer group of 16 healthcare companies1) for Total Shareholder Return (TSR),
defined as share price growth plus dividends, measured in Swiss francs at actual exchange rates. At constant exchange
rates Roche ranked number 8, with the year-end return being 17% for Roche shares and 21% for Roche non-voting equity
securities. The combined performance of share and non-voting equity security was 20% compared to a weighted average
return for the peer group of 16% in Swiss franc terms and 18% at constant exchange rates.
Share prices in healthcare outperformed many other sectors in 2012 despite the continuing pressure on healthcare prices
and sovereign debt issues in Europe and the USA. The good Roche news flow was rewarded by a relatively strong share
price performance.

Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewProposed dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing an increase of 8% in the dividend for 2012 to 7.35 Swiss francs per share and non-voting
equity security (2011: 6.80 Swiss francs) for approval at the Annual General Meeting. This is the 26th consecutive increase
in the dividend. If the dividend proposal is approved by shareholders, dividend payments on the total shares and non-voting
equity securities will amount to 6.3 billion Swiss francs (2011: 5.9 billion Swiss francs), resulting in a pay-out ratio (based
on core net income) of 54.0% (2011: 55.3%). Based on the prices at year-end 2012, the dividend yield on the Roche share is
3.9% (2011: 4.1%) and the yield on the non-voting equity security is 4.0% (2011: 4.3%). Further information on the Roche
securities is given on pages 152–153 of the Finance Report.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2012Debt
To finance the Genentech transaction, the Group issued bonds and notes equivalent to 48.2 billion Swiss francs in February
and March 2009. Of the debt raised in early 2009, 52% had already been repaid by 31 December 2012. This includes the
redemption of 2.2 billion Swiss franc-denominated notes on the due date of 23 March 2012, 0.8 billion euros of notes
originally due 4 March 2013 that were repurchased on 23 March 2012 following a tender offer, 0.2 billion euros of notes
originally due 4 March 2013 that were repurchased on 30 November 2012 following a tender offer and 0.65 billion euros of
notes originally due 4 March 2016 that were repurchased on 30 November 2012 following a tender offer. Furthermore on
20 December 2012 the Group exercised its option to call for early redemption of 1.75 billion US dollars of notes that were due
1 March 2014. These notes will be repaid on 21 March 2013.
In 2012 the Group issued a total of 1.5 billion Swiss francs of notes that will be due in 2013, 2018, and 2022 and also
issued 1.0 billion euros of notes due in 2018. These bonds have coupons between 0.3% and 2.0% and were issued to partly
refinance debt redemptions in an attractive market environment.
The maturity schedule of the Group’s bonds and notes outstanding at 31 December 2012 is shown in the table below,
which includes those instruments that were already in issue prior to the Genentech transaction.

3) Of the proceeds from these bonds and notes, 6.25 billion euros have been swapped into US dollars, and therefore in the financial statements these have economic
characteristics equivalent to US dollar-denominated bonds and notes.
4) Of the proceeds from these bonds and notes, 600 million pounds sterling have been swapped into US dollars, and therefore in the financial statements these have
economic characteristics equivalent to US dollar-denominated bonds and notes.
The Group plans to meet its debt obligations using existing liquid funds as well as cash generated from business operations.
In the full year 2012 the free cash flow was 4.6 billion Swiss francs, which included the cash generated from operations,
as well as payment of interest, tax and dividends.
For short-term financing requirements, the Group has a commercial paper programme in the United States under which
it can issue up to 7.5 billion US dollars of unsecured commercial paper notes and committed credit lines of 3.9 billion euros
available as back-stop lines. Commercial paper notes totalling 0.3 billion US dollars were outstanding as of 31 December
2012. For longer-term financing the Group maintains strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of A1 by Moody’s and
AA by Standard & Poor’s which should facilitate efficient access to international capital markets.
Credit ratings for the Roche Group at 31 December 2012
Short-term Long-term Outlook
Moody’s P–1 A1 Stable
Standard & Poor’s A–1+ AA Stable
As described above in the commentary on the net debt position, in 2009 the Group entered into derivative contracts
with third parties to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from bonds and notes issued in currencies other than US dollar.
At the same time collateral agreements were entered with the derivative counterparties to mitigate counterparty risk.

Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewFinancial risks
As at 31 December 2012 the Group has a net debt position of 10.6 billion Swiss francs (31 December 2011: 15.6 billion Swiss
francs). The financial assets of the Group are managed in a conservative way with the objective to meet the Group’s financial
obligations at all times.
Asset allocation. A considerable portion of the cash and marketable securities the Group currently holds is being used
for debt redemptions. Liquid funds are either held as cash or are invested in high-quality, investment-grade fixed income
securities with an investment horizon to meet those liquidity requirements.

Credit risk. Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations causing
financial losses for the Group. The rating profile of the Group’s 13.7 billion Swiss francs cash and fixed income marketable
securities remained strong with more than 99% being invested in the A-AAA range. As noted previously the Group has signed
netting and collateral agreements with the counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty risk on derivative positions.
At 31 December 2012 the Group has trade receivables of 10.1 billion Swiss francs. Since the beginning of 2010 there have
been increasing financial difficulties in certain Southern European countries, notably Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece.
The Group is a leading supplier in these countries and has trade receivables of 1.5 billion Swiss francs with the public
customers in these countries. The Group uses different measures to improve collections in these countries, including intense
communication with customers, negotiations of payment plans, charging of interest for late payments, and legal action.
The Group is also applying new commercial arrangements to some public hospitals in Greece and Portugal.
liquidity risk. Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point
in time. The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity
requirements at any point in time. In addition to the current liquidity position the Group has strong cash generation ability.
Those future cash flows will be used to repay debt instruments in the coming years.
Despite total debt of 24.6 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2012, Roche enjoys strong long-term investment-grade credit
ratings of A1 by Moody’s and AA by Standard & Poor’s. At the same time Roche is rated at the highest available short-term
ratings by those agencies. In the event of financing requirements, the ratings and the strong credit of Roche should permit
efficient access to international capital markets, including the commercial paper market. The Group has committed credit
lines with various financial institutions totalling 5.1 billion Swiss francs of which 4.7 billion Swiss francs serve as back-stop
line for the commercial paper programme. As at 31 December 2012 no debt has been drawn under these credit lines.
Market risk. Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities. The
exposures are predominantly related to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The Group uses
Value-at-Risk (VaR) to assess the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. VaR data indicates the value range within
which a given financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices. The VaR
data in the table below indicates the economic loss level over a period of one month which with 95% probability will not be
exceeded. Actual future economic gains and losses associated with our treasury activities may differ materially from the VaR
analyses performed due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes to interest
rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and equity investment prices, particularly in periods of high market volatilities.
Furthermore, the VaR numbers below do not include a credit risk component.

VaR – Foreign exchange component 50 49
VaR – Other price component 31 35
Diversification (67) (69)
VaR – Total 205 316
The interest rate VaR decreased reflecting the ageing of debt and the repayment of debt during 2012. As all issued debt is
held at amortised cost, the interest rate VaR is a sole metric for economic fair value changes, but there is no impact on the
carrying value or profit and loss of the Group. The foreign exchange VaR remained stable. Other price risk arises mainly
from movements in the prices of equity securities and remained largely stable. At 31 December 2012 the Group held equity
securities with a market value of 0.5 billion Swiss francs. This includes holdings in biotechnology companies which were
acquired in the context of licensing transactions or scientific collaborations.
Further information on financial risk management and financial risks and the VaR methodology is included in Note 31 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewInternational Financial Reporting Standards
The Roche Group has been using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to report its consolidated results
since 1990. In 2012 the Group has implemented various minor amendments to existing standards and interpretations, which
have no material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position. Various new standards have been issued, as
described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which should be implemented at the latest by 2013. Except
as noted below, based on the analysis to date, the Group does not anticipate that these will have a material impact on the
Group’s overall results and financial position.
Amongst other matters the revised version of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ includes the following changes to the existing
standard:
E liminating the option to defer the recognition of actuarial gains and losses from defined benefit post-employment plans,
known as the ‘corridor method’. The Group does not currently apply this option, but rather uses the option to recognise
such gains and losses in other comprehensive income. The option currently applied by the Group will henceforth be a
requirement under the revised standard and therefore this change will have no impact on the Group’s financial statements.
T he current method of including the expected income from plan assets at an estimated asset return would be replaced
by using the discount rate that is used to discount the defined benefit obligation. The Group estimates that, had this
method been applied to the 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements, net financial income would have been approximately
161 million Swiss francs lower than that published. Operating profit would not have been materially affected.

Roche Group – Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Notes to the Roche Group
Consolidated Financial Statements
Reference numbers indicate corresponding Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements (hereafter ‘the Annual Financial Statements’) of the Roche Group have been prepared
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. They have been prepared
using the historical cost convention except that, as disclosed in the accounting policies below, certain items, including
derivatives and available-for-sale investments, are shown at fair value. They were approved for issue by the Board of Directors
on 28 January 2013 and are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on 5 March 2013.
The preparation of the Annual Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of
the financial statements. If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best judgement
at the date of the financial statements, deviate from the actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will
be modified as appropriate in the year in which the circumstances change.
Consolidation policy
These financial statements are the Annual Financial Statements of Roche Holding Ltd, a company registered in Switzerland,
and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’).
The subsidiaries are those companies controlled, directly or indirectly, by Roche Holding Ltd, where control is defined as the
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. This control
is normally evidenced when Roche Holding Ltd owns, either directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or
currently exercisable potential voting rights of a company’s share capital. Special Purpose Entities are consolidated where the
substance of the relationship is that the Special Purpose Entity is controlled by the Group. Companies acquired during the
year are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group, and subsidiaries to be divested are included
up to the date on which control passes from the Group. Inter-company balances, transactions and resulting unrealised
income are eliminated in full. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they
occur after control has already been obtained and if they do not result in a loss of control.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. These are companies over which the Group exercises,
or has the power to exercise, significant influence, but which it does not control. This is normally evidenced when the
Group owns 20% or more of the voting rights or currently exercisable potential voting rights of the company. Balances
and transactions with associates that result in unrealised income are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in
the associate. Interests in joint ventures are reported using the line-by-line proportionate consolidation method.
50
Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsSegment reporting
For the purpose of segment reporting the Group’s Corporate Executive Committee (CEC) is considered to be the Group’s
Chief Operating Decision Maker. The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the organisation units
for which information is reported to the CEC on a regular basis. The information provided is used as the basis of the segment
revenue and profit disclosures reported in Note 2, with the geographic analysis based on the location of customers. Selected
segment balance sheet information is also routinely provided to the CEC. The Group has two divisions, Pharmaceuticals
and Diagnostics. Revenues are primarily generated from the sale of prescription pharmaceutical products and diagnostic
instruments, reagents and consumables, respectively. Both divisions also derive revenues from the sale or licensing of
products or technology to third parties. Residual operating activities from divested businesses and certain global activities
are reported as ‘Corporate’. These include the CEC and global group functions for communications, human resources,
finance (including treasury, taxes and pension fund management), legal, safety and environmental services. Sub-divisional
information for Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai, operating segments within the Pharmaceuticals Division, is also
presented.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis. Operating assets and liabilities consist of
property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade receivables/payables, inventories and other assets
and liabilities, such as provisions, which can be reasonably attributed to the reported operating segments. Non-operating
assets and liabilities mainly include current and deferred income tax balances, post-employment benefit assets/liabilities
and financial assets/liabilities such as cash, marketable securities, investments and debt.
Foreign currency translation
Most Group companies use their local currency as their functional currency. Certain Group companies use other currencies
(such as US dollars, Swiss francs or euros) as their functional currency where this is the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates. Local transactions in other currencies are initially reported using the exchange rate
at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses from the settlement of such transactions and gains and losses on translation
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are included in income, except when they are qualifying
cash flow hedges or arise on monetary items that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign entity.
In such cases the gains and losses are deferred into other comprehensive income.
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using functional currencies other than Swiss francs (foreign
entities) are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange. Sales, costs, expenses, net income and cash
flows are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Translation differences due to the changes in exchange
rates between the beginning and the end of the year and the difference between net income translated at the average and
year-end exchange rates are taken directly to other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign entity, the identified
cumulative currency translation differences within other comprehensive income relating to that foreign entity are recognised
in income as part of the gain or loss on divestment.
Revenues
Sales represent amounts received and receivable for goods supplied to customers after deducting trade discounts, cash
discounts and volume rebates, and exclude value added taxes and other taxes directly linked to sales. Revenues from the sale
of products are recognised upon transfer to the customer of significant risks and rewards. Trade discounts, cash discounts
and volume rebates are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of the related sales. Estimates of
expected sales returns, charge-backs and other rebates, including Medicaid in the United States and similar rebates in other
countries, are also deducted from sales and recorded as accrued liabilities or provisions or as a deduction from accounts
receivable. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual or legislatively mandated obligations, historical
trends and the Group’s experience. If the circumstances are such that the level of sales returns, and hence revenues, cannot
be reliably measured, then sales are only recognised when the right of return expires, which is generally upon prescription
of the products to patients. Other revenues are recorded as earned or as the services are performed. Where necessary,
single transactions are split into separately identifiable components to reflect the substance of the transaction. Conversely,
two or more transactions may be considered together for revenue recognition purposes, where the commercial effect
cannot be understood without reference to the series of transactions as a whole.
51
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and related production overheads of goods sold and
services rendered. Royalties, alliance and collaboration expenses, including all collaboration profit-sharing arrangements are
also reported as part of cost of sales. Start-up costs between validation and the achievement of normal production capacity
are expensed as incurred.
Research and development
Internal research costs are those costs incurred for the purpose of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and
understanding. These costs are expensed as incurred.
Internal development costs are those costs incurred for the application of research findings or other knowledge to plan
and develop new products for commercial production. Such costs would qualify for capitalisation as intangible assets only
if all of the following criteria can be demonstrated:
The technical feasibility of completing the development project successfully so that it will be available for use or sale.
The intention to complete the development project.
The ability to use or sell the results of the development project.
That the development project would generate economic benefits. This would normally be evidenced by the existence
and size of a market for the results of the project itself or the products that would result from the project.
The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development project.
The ability to measure the development expenditure reliably that would qualify for capitalisation as an intangible asset.
The development projects undertaken by the Group are subject to technical, regulatory and other uncertainties, such that,
in the opinion of management, the criteria for capitalisation are not met prior to obtaining marketing approval by the regulatory
authorities in major markets. Internal development costs that do not meet these criteria are therefore expensed as incurred.
Post-marketing studies after regulatory approval, such as phase IV costs in the pharmaceuticals business, are expensed
as incurred. They generally involve safety surveillance and on-going technical support of a drug after it receives marketing
approval to be sold. They may be required by regulatory authorities or may be undertaken for safety or commercial reasons.
The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare or long-term adverse effects over a much larger patient population
and longer time period than was possible during earlier stages of development. The costs of such post-marketing studies
are not capitalised as intangible assets, as in the opinion of management, they do not generate separately identifiable
incremental future economic benefits that can be reliably measured.
In addition to its internal research and development activities, the Group is also party to in-licensing and similar arrangements
with its alliance partners. The Group may also acquire in-process research and development assets, either through business
combinations or through purchases of specific assets.
In-process research and development resources acquired either through in-licensing arrangements, business combinations
or separate purchases are capitalised as intangible assets if they are controlled by the Group, are separately identifiable
and are expected to generate future economic benefits, even if uncertainty exists as to whether the research and
development will ultimately result in a marketable product. Consequently, upfront and milestone payments to third parties
for pharmaceutical products or compounds before regulatory marketing approval are recognised as intangible assets.
Assets acquired through such arrangements are measured on the basis set out below in the ‘Intangible assets’ policy and
are reviewed for impairment as set out below in the ‘Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets’
policy. Subsequent internal research and development costs incurred post-acquisition are treated in the same way as other
internal research and development costs. Once available for use, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis
over the period of the expected benefit and are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date. If research and development
are embedded in contracts for strategic alliances, the Group carefully assesses whether upfront or milestone payments
constitute funding of research and development work or acquisition of an asset.
52
Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsLicensing, milestone and other upfront receipts
Royalty income is recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the respective licensing agreements.
If the collectability of a royalty amount is not reasonably assured, those royalties are recognised as revenue when the cash
is received. Certain Group companies receive upfront, milestone and other similar payments from third parties relating to the
sale or licensing of products or technology. Revenue associated with performance milestones is recognised based on
achievement of the deliverables as defined in the respective agreements. Upfront payments and licence fees for which there
are subsequent deliverables are initially reported as deferred income and are recognised in income as earned over
the period of the development collaboration or the manufacturing obligation.
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits are
accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group. Where the Group provides
long-term employee benefits, the cost is accrued to match the rendering of the services by the employees concerned.
Liabilities for long-term employee benefits are discounted to take into account the time value of money, where material.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Most employees are covered by defined benefit and defined contribution post-employment plans sponsored by Group
companies. The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the appropriate income statement
heading within the operating results in the year to which they relate. The accounting and reporting of defined benefit plans
are based on recent actuarial valuations. The defined benefit obligations and service costs are calculated using the projected
unit credit method. This reflects service rendered by employees to the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions
primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth
and long-term expected rates of return for plan assets. Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-quality
corporate bonds or government bonds in countries where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. Past service costs
are allocated over the average period until the benefits become vested. Current and past service costs are charged to the
appropriate income statement heading within the operating results. Pension plan administration and funding is overseen at
a corporate level and any settlement gains and losses resulting from changes in funding arrangements are reported as
general and administration expenses within the ‘Corporate’ segment. The expected returns on plan assets and interest costs
are charged to financial income and financing costs, respectively. Actuarial gains and losses, which consist of differences
between assumptions and actual experiences and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recorded directly in
other comprehensive income. Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless the Group
has a legally enforceable right to use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan. The recognition of pension
assets is limited to the total of the present value of any future refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to
the plans and any cumulative unrecognised past service costs. Adjustments arising from the limit on the recognition of assets
for defined benefit plans are recorded directly in other comprehensive income.
Equity compensation plans
Certain employees of the Group participate in equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Chugai. The fair value
of all equity compensation awards granted to employees is estimated at the grant date and recorded as an expense over the
vesting period. The expense is charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results. For equity-
settled plans, an increase in equity is recorded for this expense and any subsequent cash flows from exercises of vested
awards are recorded as changes in equity. For cash-settled plans, a liability is recorded, which is measured at fair value at
each reporting date with any movements in fair value being recorded to the appropriate income statement heading within
the operating results. Any subsequent cash flows from exercise of vested awards are recorded as a reduction of the liability.
53
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction, and include all costs directly
attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner
intended by management. These include items such as costs of site preparation, installation and assembly costs and
professional fees. The net costs of testing whether the asset is functioning properly, including validation costs, are also
included in the initially recorded cost of construction. Interest and other borrowing costs incurred with respect to qualifying
assets are capitalised and included in the carrying value of the assets.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis, except for land, which is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives of major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
Land improvements 40 years
Buildings 10–50 years
Machinery and equipment 4–15 years
Diagnostic instruments 3–5 years
Office equipment 3–6 years
Motor vehicles 5–8 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate
components. The estimated useful lives of the assets are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation
charges are accelerated. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Leases
Where the Group is the lessee, leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all of the risks
and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the start of the lease at fair value,
or the present value of the minimum lease payments, if lower. The rental obligation, net of finance charges, is reported within
debt. Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated in accordance with the Group’s policy on property, plant and
equipment. If there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its useful life. The interest element of the lease payment is charged against
income over the lease term based on the effective interest rate method. Leases where substantially all of the risks and
rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating
leases are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where the Group is the lessor, which primarily occurs in the Diagnostics Division, assets subject to finance leases are
initially reported as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Assets subject to operating leases
are reported within property, plant and equipment. Lease income from finance leases is subsequently recognised as earned
income over the term of the lease based on the effective interest rate method. Lease income from operating leases is
recognised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The consideration transferred in
a business combination is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. This consideration includes the cash paid plus
the fair value at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by
the Group. The fair value of the consideration transferred also includes contingent consideration arrangements at fair value.
Directly attributable acquisition-related costs are expensed in the current period and reported within general and administration
expenses. At the date of acquisition the Group recognises the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and
any non-controlling interest in the acquired business. The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are initially
recognised at fair value. Where the Group does not acquire 100% ownership of the acquired business, non-controlling
interests are recorded as the proportion of the fair value of the acquired net assets attributable to the non-controlling interest.
54
Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsGoodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the
acquired business and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired business over the fair
value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired. When the initial accounting for a business combination is
incomplete at the end of a reporting period, provisional amounts are used. During the measurement period, the provisional
amounts are retrospectively adjusted and additional assets and liabilities may be recognised, to reflect new information
obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date which would have affected the measurement
of the amounts recognised at that date, had they been known. The measurement period does not exceed twelve months
from the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually and upon the occurrence
of an indication of impairment. Goodwill may also arise upon investments in associates, being the surplus of the cost of
investment over the Group’s share of the fair value of the net identifiable assets. Such goodwill is recorded within investments
in associates. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after
control has already been obtained and if they do not result in a loss of control.
Intangible assets
Purchased patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Where these assets have
been acquired through a business combination, this will be the fair value allocated in the acquisition accounting. Intangible
assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis beginning from the point when they are available for
use. The estimated useful life is the lower of the legal duration and the economic useful life. The estimated useful lives of
intangible assets are regularly reviewed.
Estimated useful lives of major classes of amortisable intangible assets are as follows:
Product intangibles in use 4–20 years
Marketing intangibles in use 2–5 years
Technology intangibles in use 7–14 years
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
An impairment assessment is carried out when there is evidence that an asset may be impaired. In addition intangible
assets that are not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. When the recoverable amount of an asset, being
the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value is
reduced to its recoverable amount. This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. Value in use is
calculated using estimated cash flows, generally over a five-year period, with extrapolating projections for subsequent years.
These are discounted using an appropriate long-term interest rate. When an impairment loss arises, the useful life of the
asset in question is reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation/amortisation charge is accelerated. The impairment
of financial assets is discussed below in the ‘Financial assets’ policy.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is assessed for possible impairment at each reporting date and is additionally tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units as described in Note 12. When the recoverable amount of the cash-generating
unit, being the higher of its fair value less costs to sell or its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying
value of the goodwill is reduced to its recoverable amount. This reduction is reported in the income statement as an
impairment loss. The methodology used in the impairment testing is further described in Note 12.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods and work in process includes
raw materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs and overheads based upon the normal capacity of
production facilities. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling
price less cost to completion and selling expenses.
55
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts, trade discounts,
cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for the difference
between the carrying value and the estimated recoverable amount where there is objective evidence that the Group will
not be able to collect all amounts due. These estimates are based on specific indicators, such as the ageing of customer
balances, specific credit circumstances and the Group’s historical experience, taking also into account economic conditions.
Expenses for doubtful trade receivables are recognised in the consolidated income statement within marketing and
distribution expenses. Trade discounts, cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances are recorded on an accrual
basis consistent with the recognition of the related sales, using estimates based on existing contractual obligations, historical
trends and the Group’s experience. Long-term accounts receivable are discounted to take into account the time value of
money, where material.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and time, call and current balances with banks and similar institutions.
Such balances are only reported as cash if they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant
risk of changes in value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. This definition is also used
for the statement of cash flows.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to an outflow
of resources that can be reasonably estimated. In particular, restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has
a detailed formal plan that has either commenced implementation or has been announced. Provisions are recorded for the
estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise, taking into account foreign currency effects arising from their translation
from their functional currency into Swiss francs and the time value of money, where material. A contingent liability is
disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation
cannot be measured with reasonable reliability. Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of
economic benefits is probable.
Fair values
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices or by the use of
established valuation techniques such as option pricing models and the discounted cash flow method if quoted prices in an
active market are not available (‘fair value hierarchy’). Valuation techniques will incorporate observable market data about
market conditions and other factors that are likely to affect the fair value of a financial instrument. Valuation techniques are
typically used for derivative financial instruments. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities at the reporting date are
not materially different from their reported carrying values unless specifically mentioned in the Notes to the Annual Financial
Statements. Information on fair value hierarchy is included in Note 31 on risk management.
Financial assets
Financial assets, principally investments, including marketable securities, are classified as either ‘Fair-value-through-profit-
or-loss’, ‘Available-for-sale’, ‘Held-to-maturity’ or ‘Loans and receivables’. Fair-value-through-profit-or-loss financial assets
are either classified as held-for-trading or designated upon initial recognition. Held-for-trading financial assets are acquired
principally to generate profit from short-term fluctuations in price. Financial assets are designated as fair-value-through-
profit-or-loss if doing so results in more relevant information by eliminating a measurement or recognition inconsistency.
Held-to-maturity financial assets are securities with a fixed maturity that the Group has the intent and ability to hold until
maturity. Loans and receivables are financial assets created by the Group or acquired from the issuer in a primary market.
They are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
All other financial assets are considered to be available-for-sale.
56
Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsAll financial assets are initially recorded at fair value, including transaction costs, except for assets at fair-value-through-
profit-or-loss, which exclude transaction costs. All purchases and sales are recognised on the settlement date. Fair-value-
through-profit-or-loss financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value, with all changes in fair value recorded as
financial income in the period in which they arise. Held-to-maturity financial assets are subsequently carried at amortised
cost using the effective interest rate method. Available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value, with all
unrealised changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income except for interest calculated using the effective
interest rate method and foreign exchange components. When the available-for-sale financial assets are sold, impaired or
otherwise disposed of, the cumulative gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are included in
financial income for the current period. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method.
Financial assets are individually assessed for possible impairment at each reporting date. An impairment charge is recorded
where there is objective evidence of impairment, such as where the issuer is in bankruptcy, default or other significant
financial difficulty. In addition any available-for-sale equity securities that have a market value of more than 25% below their
original cost, net of any previous impairment, will be considered as impaired. Any available-for-sale equity securities that
have a market value below their original cost, net of any previous impairment, for a sustained six-month period will also be
considered as impaired. Any decreases in the market price of less than 25% of original cost, net of any previous impairment,
which are also for less than a sustained six-month period are not by themselves considered as objective evidence of
impairment. Such movements in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income until there is objective evidence of
impairment or until the asset is sold or otherwise disposed of. For financial assets carried at amortised cost, any impairment
charge is the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount, calculated using estimated future cash
flows discounted using the original effective interest rate. For available-for-sale financial assets, any impairment charge is
the amount currently carried in other comprehensive income for the difference between the original cost, net of any previous
impairment, and the fair value. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring
after the impairment loss was recognised. For debt securities measured at amortised cost or available-for-sale, the reversal is
recognised in income. For equity securities held available-for-sale, the reversal is recognised directly in other comprehensive
income.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual cash flows from the asset expire or when the Group transfers
the rights to receive the contractual cash flows from the financial assets in a transaction in which substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created
or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
Derivatives
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Apart from those derivatives
designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments as discussed in the ‘Hedge accounting’ policy below, all changes in
fair value are recorded as financial income in the period in which they arise. Embedded derivatives are recognised separately
if not closely related to the host contract and where the host contract is carried at amortised cost.
Hedge accounting
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types. A ‘fair value hedge’ is a hedge of the
exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or an unrecognised firm commitment, or an identified
portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss.
A ‘cash flow hedge’ is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss. A ‘hedge of
a net investment in a foreign operation’ is a hedge of the foreign currency exposure on a net investment in a foreign operation.
57
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability
of occurrence (for cash flow hedges), hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. If these conditions are not met,
then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are
reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship. In particular any derivatives are reported at fair value, with
changes in fair value included in financial income.
For qualifying fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item is recorded at its
previous carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair value that are attributable to the hedged risk. Any changes in the fair
values are reported in financial income.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of any change in fair value
that is an effective hedge is included in other comprehensive income, and any remaining ineffective portion is reported in
financial income. If the hedging relationship is the hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment or highly probable
forecasted transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the cumulative changes in the fair
value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying
value of the asset or liability at the date of recognition. For all other qualifying cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes in
the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive income are included in financial
income when the forecasted transaction affects net income.
For qualifying hedges of net investment in a foreign entity, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of any
change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in other comprehensive income. Any remaining ineffective portion is
recorded in financial income where the hedging instrument is a derivative and in other comprehensive income in other cases.
If the entity is disposed of, then the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in
other comprehensive income are reclassified to income.
Debt
Debt instruments are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Subsequently they are
reported at amortised cost. Any discount between the net proceeds received and the principal value due on redemption is
amortised over the duration of the debt instrument and is recognised as part of financing costs using the effective interest rate
method. The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding taxes payable on the
distribution of retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based on income, such as property and capital taxes,
are included within general and administration expenses.
Liabilities for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally
relating to subsidiaries, are only recognised where it is probable that such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements. Deferred income tax assets relating to the carry-forward
of unused tax losses are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which
the unused tax losses can be utilised.
Current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the same taxation
authority and when there is a legally enforceable right to offset them. Deferred income taxes are determined based on
the currently enacted tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction where the Group operates.

Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsOwn equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The original purchase cost,
consideration received for subsequent resale of these equity instruments and other movements are reported as changes
in equity. These instruments have been acquired primarily to meet the potential obligations to employees that may arise
in respect of certain of the Group’s equity compensation plans.
Management judgements made in applying accounting policies
The application of the Group’s accounting policies may require management to make judgements, apart from those involving
estimates, that can have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Annual Financial Statements. Management
judgement is particularly required when assessing the substance of transactions that have a complicated structure or legal
form. These include, but are not limited to, the following areas:
Revenue recognition. The nature of the Group’s business is such that many sales transactions do not have a simple
structure. Sales agreements may consist of multiple components occurring at different times. The Group is also party
to various out-licensing agreements, which can involve upfront and milestone payments that may occur over several
years. These agreements may also involve certain future obligations. Revenue is only recognised when, in management’s
judgement, the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred and when the Group does not retain
continuing managerial involvement or effective control over the goods sold or when the obligation has been fulfilled. For
some transactions this can result in cash receipts being initially recognised as deferred income and then released to income
over subsequent periods on the basis of the performance of the conditions specified in the agreement.
Consolidation of subsidiaries and associates. The Group periodically undertakes transactions that may involve obtaining
the right to control or significantly influence the operations of other companies. These transactions include the acquisition of
all or part of the equity of other companies, the purchase of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities and contingent
liabilities of other companies, and entering into alliance agreements with other companies. Also included are transactions
involving Special Purpose Entities and similar vehicles. In all such cases management makes an assessment as to whether
the Group has the right to control or significantly influence the other company’s operations, and based on this assessment
the other company is consolidated as a subsidiary or associated company. In making this assessment management considers
the underlying economic substance of the transaction and not only the contractual terms.
Business combinations. Where the Group acquires control of another business, the identifiable assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired business shall be recognised, separately from goodwill.
This process involves management making an assessment of the fair value of these items. Management judgement is
particularly involved in the recognition and measurement of the following items:
Intellectual property. This may include patents, licences, trademarks and similar rights for currently marketed products,
and also the rights and scientific knowledge associated with projects that are currently in research or development phases.
Contingencies such as legal and environmental matters.
Contingent consideration arrangements.
The recoverability of any accumulated tax losses previously incurred by the acquired company.
In all cases management makes an assessment based on the underlying economic substance of the items concerned,
and not only on the contractual terms, in order to fairly present these items.
Leases. The Group is party to leasing arrangements, both as a lessee and as a lessor. The treatment of leasing transactions
in the financial statements is mainly determined by whether the lease is considered to be an operating lease or a finance
lease. In making this assessment, management looks at the substance of the lease, as well as the legal form, and makes a
judgement about whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Arrangements which do not
take the legal form of a lease but that nevertheless convey the right to use an asset are also covered by such assessments.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the Annual Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and related
disclosures. The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgements about
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Changes in accounting estimates may be
necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based, or as a result of new information or
more experience. Such changes are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.
The key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing
a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next twelve months are described below.
Revenue recognition. There may be circumstances such that the level of sales returns, and hence revenues, cannot
be reliably measured. In such cases sales are only recognised when the right of return expires, which is generally upon
prescription of the products to patients. In order to estimate this, management uses publicly available information about
prescriptions as well as information provided by wholesalers and other intermediaries.
Sales allowances. The Group has provisions and accruals for expected sales returns, charge-backs and other rebates,
including Medicaid in the United States and similar rebates in other countries, which at 31 December 2012 total 1,856 million
Swiss francs. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual or legislatively-mandated obligations, historical
trends and the Group’s experience. Management believes that the total provisions and accruals for these items are adequate,
based upon currently available information. As these deductions are based on management estimates, they may be subject
to change as better information becomes available. Such changes that arise could impact the provisions and accruals
recognised in the balance sheet in future periods and consequently the level of sales recognised in the income statement
in future periods.
Allowances for doubtful accounts receivable. The Group has provisions for doubtful receivables, which at 31 December
2012 total 474 million Swiss francs (see Note 17). Such estimates are based on analyses of ageing of customer balances,
specific credit circumstances, historical trends and the Group’s experience, taking also into account economic conditions.
Management believes that the total provisions and accruals for these items are adequate, based upon currently available
information. As these provisions are based on management estimates, they may be subject to change as better information
becomes available. Such changes that arise could impact the provisions recognised in the balance sheet in future periods
and consequently the marketing and distribution expenses recognised in the income statement in future periods.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill. The Group has property, plant and equipment
with a carrying value of 15,402 million Swiss francs as disclosed in Note 11. Goodwill has a carrying value of 7,480 million
Swiss francs (see Note 12) and intangible assets have a carrying value of 4,214 million Swiss francs (see Note 13). All of
these assets are reviewed annually for impairment as described above. To assess whether any impairment exists, estimates
are made of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal. Actual outcomes
could vary significantly from such estimates of discounted future cash flows. Factors such as changes in the planned use of
buildings, machinery or equipment, or closure of facilities, the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence
or lower than anticipated sales of products with capitalised rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
Changes in the discount rates used could also lead to impairments.
60
Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsPensions and other post-employment benefits. Many of the Group’s employees participate in post-employment defined
benefit plans. The calculations of the recognised assets and liabilities from such plans are based upon statistical and
actuarial calculations. In particular the present value of the defined benefit obligation is impacted by assumptions on discount
rates used to arrive at the present value of future pension liabilities, and assumptions on future increases in salaries and
benefits. Furthermore, the Group’s independent actuaries use statistically based assumptions covering areas such as future
withdrawals of participants from the plan and estimates of life expectancy. At 31 December 2012 the present value of the
Group’s defined benefit obligation is 13,824 million Swiss francs for funded plans and 4,090 million Swiss francs for unfunded
plans (see Note 9). The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changes in market and
economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, longer or shorter life spans of participants, and other changes in
the factors being assessed. These differences could impact the assets or liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in future
periods.
Legal provisions. Group companies are party to various legal matters, including claims arising from trade, and the
most significant matters are described in Note 24. Legal provisions at 31 December 2012 total 728 million Swiss francs.
Management believes that the total provisions for legal matters are adequate based upon currently available information.
Most of the legal matters involve highly complex issues which are subject to substantial uncertainties and therefore the
probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is difficult to ascertain. Given the
inherent difficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, it cannot be guaranteed that additional costs will not be incurred
beyond the amounts accrued. Additional claims could be made which might not be covered by existing provisions or by
insurance. There can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in the scope of these matters or that any future
lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations will not be material. Such changes that arise could impact the provisions
recognised in the balance sheet in future periods. For a number of the legal matters, it is not possible to make a reasonable
estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from the ultimate resolution of these matters. In these cases,
Roche discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the legal matters. Disclosure of which legal matters
have been provided for and which have been disclosed as contingent liabilities has not been made as this would seriously
prejudice our position in these matters.
Environmental provisions. The Group has provisions for environmental remediation costs, which at 31 December 2012
total 566 million Swiss francs, as disclosed in Note 24. The material components of the environmental provisions consist of
costs to fully clean and refurbish contaminated sites, including landfills, and to treat and contain contamination at certain
other sites. Future remediation expenses are affected by a number of uncertainties that include, but are not limited to,
the detection of previously unknown contaminated sites, the method and extent of remediation, the percentage of the
problematic materials attributable to the Group at the remediation sites relative to that attributable to other parties, and
the financial capabilities of the other potentially responsible parties. Management believes that the total provisions for
environmental matters are adequate based upon currently available information. However, given the inherent difficulties
in estimating liabilities in this area, it cannot be guaranteed that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts
accrued. The effect of the resolution of environmental matters on the results of operations cannot be predicted due to
uncertainty concerning both the amount and the timing of future expenditures. Such changes that arise could impact the
provisions recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Income taxes. At 31 December 2012 the net liability for current income taxes is 1,871 million Swiss francs and the net
asset for deferred income taxes is 3,462 million Swiss francs, as disclosed in Note 5. Significant estimates are required
to determine the current and deferred assets and liabilities for income taxes. Some of these estimates are based on
interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Management believes that the estimates are reasonable and that the
recognised liabilities for income tax-related uncertainties are adequate. Various internal and external factors may have
favourable or unfavourable effects on the income tax assets and liabilities. These factors include, but are not limited to,
changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, future levels
of research and development spending and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. Such changes that arise could
impact the assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
61
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Changes in accounting policies
Changes in accounting policies that arise from the application of new or revised standards and interpretations are applied
retrospectively, unless the transitional requirements of the particular standard or interpretation specify that the changes are
to be applied prospectively. Retrospective application requires that the results of the comparative period and the opening
balances of that period are restated as if the new accounting policy had always been applied. Prospective application
requires that the new accounting policy only be applied to the results of the current period and the comparative period
is not restated. Comparatives are reclassified or extended from the previously reported results to take into account any
presentational changes that are required on the application of new or revised standards and interpretations.
Changes in IFRS implemented in 2012. The Group has implemented various minor amendments to existing standards and
interpretations, which have no material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position.
New and revised standards. The following new standards have been issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board (IASB) and will be implemented on 1 January 2013:
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’.
IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’.
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’.
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’.
IAS 19 (revised) ‘Employee Benefits’.
The Group does not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the Group’s overall
results and financial position, except for IAS 19 (revised) ‘Employee Benefits’.
The revised version of IAS 19 will be adopted on 1 January 2013 and will be applied retrospectively. Amongst other matters
the revised version of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ includes the following changes to the existing standard:
Eliminating the option to defer the recognition of actuarial gains and losses from defined benefit post-employment plans,
known as the ‘corridor method’. The Group does not currently apply this option, but rather uses the option to recognise
such gains and losses directly in other comprehensive income. The option currently applied by the Group will henceforth
be a requirement under the revised standard and therefore this change will have no impact on the Group’s financial
statements.
The current method of including the expected income from plan assets at an estimated asset return would be replaced
by using the discount rate that is used to discount the defined benefit obligation. The Group estimates that, had this
method been applied to the 2012 Annual Financial Statements, net financial income would have been approximately
161 million Swiss francs lower than that published. Operating profit would not have been materially affected.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Supplementary unaudited information on sales by therapeutic areas in the Pharmaceuticals Division and by business areas in
the Diagnostics Division are given in the Financial Review. Sales are allocated to geographical areas by destination according
to the location of the customer. Royalties and other operating income are allocated according to the location of the Group
company that receives the revenue. European Union information is based on members of the EU as at 31 December 2012.
Major customers
The US national wholesale distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corp. and McKesson Corp., each represented approximately
5 billion Swiss francs of the Group’s revenues (2011: AmerisourceBergen Corp. 5 billion Swiss francs and McKesson Corp.
4 billion Swiss francs). Approximately 96% of these revenues were in the Pharmaceuticals operating segment, with the
residual in the Diagnostics segment. The Group also reported substantial revenues from the US national wholesale
distributor, Cardinal Health, Inc., and in total these three customers represented approximately a quarter of the Group’s
revenues.
3. Chugai
Effective 1 October 2002 the Roche Group and Chugai completed an alliance to create a leading research-driven Japanese
pharmaceutical company, which was formed by the merger of Chugai and Roche’s Japanese pharmaceuticals subsidiary,
Nippon Roche. The merged company, known as Chugai, is a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group. At 31 December 2012
the Group’s interest in Chugai was 61.6% (2011: 61.6%).
The common stock of Chugai is publicly traded and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the stock code ‘TSE:4519’.
Chugai prepares financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (JGAAP). These
are filed on a quarterly basis with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to certain consolidation entries and differences in the
requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and JGAAP, there are differences between Chugai’s
stand-alone results on a JGAAP basis and the results of Chugai as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with
IFRS.
Roche’s relationship with Chugai
Chugai has entered into certain agreements with Roche, which are discussed below:
Basic Alliance Agreement. As part of the Basic Alliance Agreement signed in December 2001, Roche and Chugai entered
into certain arrangements covering the future operation and governance of Chugai. Amongst other matters these cover
the following areas:
The structuring of the alliance.
Roche’s rights as a shareholder.
Roche’s rights to nominate members of Chugai’s Board of Directors.
Certain limitations to Roche’s ability to buy or sell Chugai’s common stock.
Chugai issues additional shares of common stock in connection with its convertible debt and equity compensation plans,
and may issue additional shares for other purposes, which affects Roche’s percentage ownership interest. The Basic
Alliance Agreement provides, amongst other matters, that Chugai will guarantee Roche’s right to maintain its shareholding
percentage in Chugai at not less than 50.1%.
Licensing Agreements. Under the Japan Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in December 2001, Chugai has exclusive rights
to market Roche’s pharmaceutical products in Japan. Chugai also has right of first refusal on the development and marketing
in Japan of all development compounds advanced by Roche.
66
Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsUnder the Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in May 2002, Roche has the right of first refusal on the
development and marketing of Chugai’s development compounds in markets outside Japan, excluding South Korea, if Chugai
decides that it requires a partner for such activities.
Further to these agreements, Roche and Chugai have signed a series of separate agreements for certain specific products.
Depending on the specific circumstances and the terms of the agreement, this may result in payments on an arm’s length
basis between Roche and Chugai, for any or all of the following matters:
Upfront payments, if a right of first refusal to license a product is exercised.
Milestone payments, dependent upon the achievement of agreed performance targets.
Royalties on future product sales.
These specific product agreements may also cover the manufacture and supply of the respective products to meet the other
party’s clinical and/or commercial requirements on an arm’s length basis.
Research Collaboration Agreements. Roche and Chugai have entered into research collaboration agreements in the areas
of small-molecule synthetic drug research and biotechnology-based drug discovery.
Dividends
The dividends distributed to third parties holding Chugai shares during 2012 totalled 98 million Swiss francs (2011: 100 million
Swiss francs) and have been recorded against non-controlling interests (see Note 29). Dividends paid by Chugai to Roche
are eliminated on consolidation as inter-company items.
East Japan Earthquake
On 11 March 2011 a severe earthquake and tsunami struck the Pacific coast of Tohoku, Japan. The consequences on
Chugai’s operations in Japan were limited. The impacts of this disaster have been carefully reviewed regarding operations,
manufacturing processes and supply chain. Damage at Chugai’s Utsunomiya manufacturing plant resulted in operations
there being temporarily halted and production of all products at this plant was fully resumed by the end of August 2011. The
costs recorded in 2011 for the damage caused by the earthquake mainly relate to the Utsunomiya plant. These consisted of
impairments and restoration costs for buildings and partially damaged facilities, write-offs of some intermediates and finished
products and other costs during shutdown, net of amounts received from insurance. These costs were recorded as shown
below. Some of Chugai’s contract manufacturers were also affected by the earthquake and, as a result, product shipment
control lasted until the end of October 2011. Chugai’s promotional activities in Japan were affected, with events cancelled
and employee resources diverted to ensure continued product supply and information flow for customers. These factors had

Since the Group operates internationally, it is subject to income taxes in many different tax jurisdictions. The Group calculates
its average expected tax rate as a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
This rate changes from year to year due to changes in the mix of the Group’s taxable income and changes in local tax rates.
The Group’s average expected tax rate increased by 0.7 percentage points to 20.3% in 2012 (2011: 19.6%). The main driver
of the increase was due to the growth in the proportion of the Group’s profits generated in the US and Japan, both of which
have a relatively higher local tax rate than the average Group rate. There were no significant local tax rate changes in the
main operating areas of the Group compared to 2011.
The Group’s effective tax rate increased by 1.0 percentage point to 20.7% in 2012 (2011: 19.7%). Other than the 0.7 percentage
points increase in the average expected tax rate, the other main driver for the increase was the non-deductible goodwill
impairment.
The Group’s effective tax rate can be reconciled to the Group’s average expected tax rate as follows:
Reconciliation of the Group’s effective tax rate
2012 2011
Average expected tax rate 20.3% 19.6%
Tax effect of
– Non-taxable income/non-deductible expenses +1.8% +1.1%
– Equity compensation plans –0.3% –0.1%
– Research, development and other manufacturing tax credits –2.1% –2.1%
– US state tax impacts +0.8% +0.9%
– O ther differences +0.2% +0.3%
Group’s effective tax rate 20.7% 19.7%
The income tax benefits recorded in respect of equity compensation plans, which varies according to the price of the
underlying equity, was 133 million Swiss francs (2011: 120 million Swiss francs). Had the income tax benefits been recorded
solely on the basis of the IFRS 2 expense multiplied by the applicable tax rate, then benefits of approximately 107 million
Swiss francs (2011: 112 million Swiss francs) would have been recorded.

Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsDeferred income tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward only to the extent that realisation of the related tax
benefit is probable. The Group has unrecognised tax losses, including valuation allowances, as follows:

Acquisitions – 2012
Verum. Effective 3 January 2012 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in the privately owned company Verum
Diagnostica GmbH, (‘Verum’), based in Munich, Germany. Verum is specialised in coagulation diagnostics with a focus
on platelet function testing, the most rapidly growing field in the coagulation market. Verum is reported as part of the
Diagnostics operating segment. The acquisition of Verum will allow the Group to gain further market share in the coagulation
segment and thus further strengthen its leading position in the clinical diagnostic market. The purchase consideration
was 11 million euros of which 10 million euros were paid in cash and 1 million euros arose from a contingent consideration
arrangement. The contingent payment from this arrangement is based on the achievement of performance-related
milestones and the range of outcomes, undiscounted, is between zero and 2 million euros. A liability of 1 million Swiss francs
was recognised at the acquisition date and at 31 December 2012, based on management’s best estimate of the probability-
adjusted expected cash outflow from the arrangement. The purchase consideration of 13 million Swiss francs has been
allocated as shown in the table below.

Pharmaceuticals Division - Research and Development reorganisation
On 26 June 2012 the Group announced a streamlining of the research and development activities within the Pharmaceuticals
Division. As part of this plan the US site in Nutley, New Jersey will be closed by the end of 2013, with a reduction in the
workforce of approximately 1,000 people. The research and development activities currently undertaken at Nutley will be
consolidated at existing sites in Switzerland and Germany and at the planned Translational Clinical Research Center at the
Alexandria Centre for Life Science in Manhattan, US. The resulting savings from the global site consolidation and related
infrastructure cost, the bundling of support functions as well as shifts in the portfolio allow the reallocation of resources
to the growing number of clinical programmes. The Group will continue research and development activities in the United
States through its Genentech organisation, which is based in South San Francisco and not affected by this reorganisation.
Research and development activities in the Diagnostics Division and at Chugai are also not affected.
During 2012 costs of 885 million Swiss francs were incurred, based on latest estimates of the cost of the reorganisation.
Of this amount, 188 million Swiss francs were provisions for severance payments and other employee-related costs,
net of estimated curtailment gains. A charge of 381 million Swiss francs was recorded for impairments of property, plant
and equipment at the Nutley site.
In addition environmental remediation costs of 243 million Swiss francs were recorded based on the initial estimates of
the additional remediation activities that may be needed before the Nutley site can be sold. Impairment charges to intangible
assets of 46 million Swiss francs were recorded as a result of portfolio prioritisation decisions linked to this reorganisation
(see Note 13).
75
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Diagnostics Division – Applied Science and Diabetes Care restructuring
Initiatives were announced in 2012 for the Applied Science and Diabetes Care businesses, which include streamlining
the product portfolio, consolidating research and development activities and increasing the efficiency of marketing and
distribution operations. In total, costs of 180 million Swiss francs were incurred in 2012, which relate to employee termination
and site closure costs. In addition, goodwill impairment charges of 187 million Swiss francs were incurred for the full write-
off of the goodwill from the 2007 NimbleGen acquisition, resulting from the decision to exit the Microarray business as part
of the reorganisation of the Applied Science business area (see Note 12) and 29 million Swiss francs for the impairment of
intangible assets in this business area (see Note 13).
Pharmaceuticals Division - Global informatics reorganisation
In the first half of 2012 the Pharmaceuticals Division announced a reorganisation of the global informatics function within the
division. Costs of 49 million Swiss francs were incurred, which mainly consisted of severance payments and other employee-
related costs.
Other global restructuring plans
On 17 November 2010 the Group announced the Operational Excellence global restructuring plan. The restructuring
activities were substantially completed by the end of 2012 and incurred a total cost of 2.8 billion Swiss francs, of which
2.3 billion Swiss francs was incurred during 2010 and 2011 and 0.5 billion Swiss francs was incurred in 2012.
In 2012 costs of 484 million Swiss francs were incurred for the previously announced Operational Excellence programme,
mainly for employee-related costs for sales force restructuring initiatives in the Pharmaceuticals Division, and employee-
related and site closure costs in the Diagnostics Division in respect of the sites in Burgdorf, Switzerland and Graz, Austria.
During 2011 costs of 940 million Swiss francs were incurred mainly for employee-related costs for restructuring initiatives
and IT reorganisation costs in the Pharmaceuticals Division, the impairment of the manufacturing site at Boulder, Colorado
(sold 31 August 2011), losses on the divestment of the research and development site in Madison, Wisconsin and the
research site in Kulmbach, Germany. These costs were partially offset by a gain on the disposal of the site at Palo Alto,
California (sold 13 June 2011).
In the second quarter of 2012 the Pharmaceuticals Division initiated a detailed review following the announcement of the
results of the second interim analysis of the dalcetrapib dal-OUTCOMES Phase III trial and the subsequent termination of the
dal-OUTCOMES trial and all the studies in the dal-HEART programme. Restructuring costs of 128 million Swiss francs were
incurred, which consist of remaining trial costs and write-offs of inventories and property, plant and equipment. Additionally
112 million Swiss francs were expensed for the write-off of previously acquired intangible assets (see Note 13).

Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements9. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group’s objective is to provide attractive and competitive post-employment benefits to employees, while at the same
time ensuring that the various plans are appropriately financed and managing any potential impacts on the Group’s long-
term financial position. Most employees are covered by pension plans sponsored by Group companies. The nature of such
plans varies according to legal regulations, fiscal requirements and market practice in the countries in which the employees
are employed. Other post-employment benefits consist mostly of post-retirement healthcare and life insurance schemes,
principally in the United States. Post-employment benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the
Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal
or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. All other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’, even if the
Group’s potential obligation is relatively minor or has a relatively remote possibility of arising. Consequently most of the
Group’s post-employment benefit plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’ for the purpose of these financial statements.
Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans typically consist of payments by employees and by the Group to funds administered by third
parties. Payments by the Group were 313 million Swiss francs (2011: 303 million Swiss francs). No assets or liabilities
are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet in respect of such plans, apart from regular prepayments and accruals of
the contributions withheld from employees’ wages and salaries and of the Group’s contributions.
Defined benefit plans
The Group’s major defined benefit plans are located in Switzerland, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and
Japan. Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by payments from the Group and by
employees. In some cases, notably for the major defined benefit plans in Germany, the plans are unfunded and the Group
pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources.
Current and past service costs are charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results.
Pension plan administration and funding is overseen at a corporate level, and any settlement gains and losses resulting
from changes in funding arrangements are reported as general and administration expenses within the Corporate segment.
The expected returns on plan assets and interest costs are charged to financial income and financing costs, respectively.
Actuarial gains and losses are recorded directly in other comprehensive income. The recognition of pension assets is limited
to the total of the present value of any future refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans and
any cumulative unrecognised past service costs. Adjustments arising from the limit on the recognition of assets for defined
benefit plans are recorded directly in other comprehensive income.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012The funding of the Group’s various defined benefit plans is overseen at a corporate level. Qualified independent actuaries
carry out valuations on a regular basis and for major plans annually as at the reporting date. For funded plans, which
are usually trusts independent of the Group’s finances, the net asset/liability recognised on the Group’s balance sheet
corresponds to the over/under funding of the plan, adjusted for unrecognised past service costs. For unfunded plans, where
the Group meets the pension obligations directly from its own financial resources, a liability for the defined benefit obligation
is recorded in the Group’s balance sheet. Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless
the Group has a legally enforceable right to use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan. Amounts
recognised in the balance sheet for post-employment benefits are predominantly non-current and are reported in non-
current assets and liabilities.

Actuarial assumptions
Actuarial assumptions are unbiased and mutually compatible estimates of variables that determine the ultimate cost of
providing post-employment benefits. They are set on an annual basis by local management and actuaries and are subject to
approval by corporate management and the Group’s actuaries. Actuarial assumptions consist of demographic assumptions
on matters such as mortality and employee turnover, and financial assumptions on matters such as interest rates, returns on
investments, salary and benefit levels, inflation rates and costs of medical benefits. The Group operates defined benefit plans
in many countries and the actuarial assumptions vary based upon local economic and social conditions.
Demographic assumptions. The most significant demographic assumptions relate to mortality rates. The Group’s actuaries
use mortality tables which take into account historic patterns and expected changes, such as further increases in longevity.

currencies and interest rates, are shown below.

Discount rates, which are used to calculate the discounted present value of the defined benefit obligation, are determined
with reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds, or government bonds in countries where there is not a deep
market in corporate bonds. The currency and term of the bonds are consistent with the obligation being discounted. The
interest cost included in the income statement is calculated by multiplying the discount rate by the defined benefit obligation.

Expected returns on plan assets are based on market expectations of expected returns on the assets in funded plans over
the duration of the related obligation. This takes into account the split of the plan assets between equities, bonds, property
and other investments. The calculation includes assumptions concerning expected dividend and interest income, realised
and unrealised gains on plan assets and taxes and administration costs borne by the plan. These are based on long-term
market expectations and the actual performance is continually monitored by corporate management. Due to the long-term
nature of the obligations, the assumptions used for matters such as returns on investments may not necessarily be consistent
with recent historical patterns. The expected return on plan assets included in the income statement is calculated by
multiplying the expected rate of return by the fair value of plan assets. The difference between the expected return and the
actual return in any twelve-month period is an actuarial gain/loss and is recorded directly to other comprehensive income.
The actual return on plan assets was a gain of 892 million Swiss francs (2011: gain of 20 million Swiss francs).
82
Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsExpected rates of salary increases, which are used to calculate the defined benefit obligation and the current service cost
included in the income statement, are based on the latest expectation and historical behaviour within Group companies.
Expected inflation rates are derived by looking at the level of inflation implied by the financial markets in conjunction with
the economists’ price inflation forecasts, historic price inflation as well as other economic variables and circumstances.
Medical cost trend rates are used to calculate the defined benefit obligation and the current service cost included in the
income statement of post-employment medical plans. These take into account the benefits set out in the plan terms and
expected future changes in medical costs. Since the Group’s major post-employment medical plans are for US employees,
these rates are driven by developments in the United States. The effect of one percentage point increase or decrease in
the medical cost trend rate is shown below.

Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements10. Employee stock options and other equity compensation plans
The Group operates several equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Chugai. IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’
requires that the fair value of all equity compensation plan awards granted to employees be estimated at grant date and
recorded as an expense over the vesting period. The expense is charged against the appropriate income statement heading.

The net cash outflow from transactions in own equity instruments mainly arises from sales and purchases of non-voting
equity securities (Genussscheine) and derivative instruments thereon which are held for the Group’s potential conversion
obligations that may arise from the Group’s equity-settled equity compensation plans. These derivative instruments mainly
consist of call options that are exercisable at any time up to their maturity (see Note 27).
Roche Long-Term. During 2005 the Group implemented a new global long-term incentive programme which is available to
certain directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The programme consists of Stock-
settled Stock Appreciation Rights (‘S-SARs’), with the Group having the alternative of granting awards under the existing
Roche Option Plan. In 2009, following the integration of Genentech, the Group also established a Restricted Stock Unit
(‘RSU’) plan. The first awards of this plan were made in September 2009 to employees at Genentech. The S-SARs are issued
in accordance with the Roche S-SAR Plan regulations, under which 180 million S-SARs will be available for issuance over
a ten-year period. The RSUs are issued in accordance with the Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan regulations, under which
20 million non-voting equity securities will be available for issuance over a ten-year period. The Remuneration Committee
determines the number of non-voting equity securities that will be available under the plans each year. The Plan regulations
for both the S-SAR and the RSU plans were restated and amended effective 1 January 2013. Further details of both plans
are given in the relevant sections below.
Share option plans
Roche Option Plan. Awards under this plan give employees the right to purchase non-voting equity securities at an exercise
price specified at the grant date. The Roche Option Plan regulations were restated and amended effective 1 January 2013
(referred to as the ‘Roche Option Plan’). The options, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a seven-year
duration and vest on a phased basis over three years, subject to continued employment. The Roche Option Plan includes
provisions with respect to the consequences of termination of employment, the effect of certain corporate transactions
and the authority of the Remuneration Committee and Executive Committee to interpret and administer the plan. The
Group covers such obligations by purchasing non-voting equity securities or derivatives thereon (see Note 27). With the
introduction of Roche Long-Term in 2005, the number of options granted under the Roche Option Plan was significantly
reduced, as most eligible employees now receive Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights instead.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Volatility was determined primarily by reference to historically observed prices of the underlying equity. Risk-free interest
rates are derived from zero coupon swap rates at the grant date taken from Datastream. The early exercise factor describes
the ratio between the expected market price at the exercise date and the exercise price at which early exercises can be
expected, based on historically observed behaviour.
Exercise of share options in 2012. The weighted average share price of Roche non-voting equity securities during the year
was 168.47 Swiss francs.
Other equity compensation plans
Bonus Stock Awards. Certain members of the Corporate Executive Committee will be granted Bonus Stock Awards in lieu
of part or all of their cash-settled bonus for the financial year 2012. These will be issued by the end of April 2013 with a total
fair value of 5 million Swiss francs. The number of awards and fair value per award will be calculated at the grant date.
Roche Connect. This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the United States and certain
other countries, to make regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting equity securities. It is administered
by independent third parties. The Group contributes to the programme, which allows the employees to purchase non-voting
equity securities at a discount (usually 20%). The programme has been operational since 1 October 2002. The administrator
purchases the necessary non-voting equity securities directly from the market. At 31 December 2012 the administrator held
2.3 million non-voting equity securities (2011: 2.2 million). During the year the cost of the plan was 12 million Swiss francs
(2011: 13 million Swiss francs), which was reported within the relevant expenditure line by function.
Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights. With the introduction of Roche Long-Term in 2005, the Group offers
Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) to certain directors, management and employees selected at the
discretion of the Group. The S-SARs give employees the right to receive non-voting equity securities reflecting the value
of any appreciation in the market price of the non-voting equity securities between the grant date and the exercise date.
The S-SAR Plan regulations were restated and amended effective 1 January 2013 (referred to as the ‘Roche S-SAR Plan’).
Under the Roche S-SAR Plan, 180 million S-SARs will be available for issuance over a ten-year period. The rights, which
are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years. The
Roche S-SAR Plan also includes provisions with respect to the consequences of termination of employment, the effect of
certain corporate transactions and the authority of the Remuneration Committee and Executive Committee to interpret
and administer the plan. Within the meaning of Section 25102(o) of Title 4 of the California Corporations Code and Sections
260.140.41 and 260.140.42 of Title 10 of the California Code of Regulations, approval of these Annual Financial Statements
constitutes approval of the Roche S-SAR Plan, which is described in these Annual Financial Statements, by a majority of
Roche Holding Ltd’s outstanding securities entitled to vote. The Group covers such obligations by purchasing non-voting
equity securities, or derivatives thereon (see Note 27).

The weighted average fair value of the rights granted in 2012 was calculated using the Binomial model and the inputs to
the model were consistent with those used for the Roche Option Plan 2012 awards. The resulting weighted average fair value
per right is 16.52 Swiss francs giving a total fair value of 325 million Swiss francs which is charged over the vesting period
of three years.
Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan. The Group issues Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) awards to certain directors,
management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The RSUs, which are non-tradable, represent the right
to receive non-voting equity securities which vest only after a three-year period.
The RSU Plan regulations were restated and amended effective 1 January 2013 (referred to as the ‘Roche RSU Plan’).
Under the Roche RSU Plan 20 million non-voting equity securities will be available for issuance over a ten-year period. The
awards, which are non-tradable, represent the right to receive non-voting equity securities which generally vest after a
three year period, subject to performance conditions, if any. The Roche RSU Plan also includes a value adjustment which will
be an amount equivalent to the sum of shareholder distributions made by the Group during the vesting period attributable
to the number of non-voting equity securities for which an individual award has been granted. In addition, the Roche RSU
Plan includes provisions with respect to the consequences of termination of employment, the effect of certain corporate
transactions and the authority of the Remuneration Committee and Executive Committee to interpret and administer the plan.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Roche Performance Share Plan. The Group offers future non-voting equity security awards (or, at the discretion of the
Board of Directors, their cash equivalent) to certain directors and key senior managers. These are non-tradable equity-
settled awards. The programme was established at the beginning of 2002 and currently operates in annual three-year cycles.
The Roche Performance Share Plan regulations were restated and amended effective 1 January 2013 (referred to as the
‘Roche PSP Plan’). The Roche PSP Plan includes a value adjustment which will be an amount equivalent to the sum of
shareholder distributions made by the Group during the vesting period attributable to the number of non-voting equity
securities for which an individual award has been granted. In addition, the Roche PSP Plan includes provisions with respect
to the consequences of termination of employment, the effect of certain corporate transactions and the authority of the
Remuneration Committee and Executive Committee to interpret and administer the plan. The terms of the currently outstanding
awards are set out in the table below. The amount of non-voting equity securities allocated will depend upon the individual’s
salary level, the achievement of performance targets linked to the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (shares and non-voting
equity securities combined) relative to the Group’s peers during the three-year period from the date of the grant, and the
discretion of the Board of Directors. Each award will result in between zero and two non-voting equity securities, depending
upon the achievement of the performance targets.

The weighted average fair value of the 142,981 awards granted in 2012 was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation.
The input parameters to the model were the covariance matrix between Roche and the other individual companies of
the peer group based on a three-year history and a risk-free rate of minus 0.067%. The valuation also takes into account
the defined rank and performance structure which determines the pay-out of the plan.
Chugai Stock Acquisition Rights. During 2003 Chugai adopted a Stock Acquisition Rights programme. The programme
allows for the granting of rights to employees and directors of Chugai. The 3,340 rights issued in 2012 (2011: 3,250) are non-
tradable equity-settled awards, have a ten-year duration and vest after two years. Each right entitles the holder to purchase
100 Chugai shares at a specified exercise price. The total fair value of rights issued was equivalent to 1 million Swiss francs
(2011: 1 million Swiss francs), which was calculated using a binomial model.
Chugai Retirement Stock Acquisition Rights. For the first time in 2009 Chugai issued Stock Acquisition Rights in lieu
of the Retirement Gratuities System for Directors which was abolished. The 817 rights issued in 2012 (2011: 888) have a
thirty-year duration and vest upon the holder’s retirement as a director of Chugai. Each right entitles the holder to purchase
100 Chugai shares at an exercise price of 100 Japanese yen. The total fair value of rights issued was equivalent to 1 million
Swiss francs (2011: 1 million Swiss francs), which was calculated using a binomial model.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposal. Factors such as changes in the planned use of buildings, machinery or equipment, or closure
of facilities, the presence or absence of competition and technical obsolescence could result in shortened useful lives or
impairment. Impairment charges of 55 million Swiss francs (2011: 25 million Swiss francs) are reported as part of ‘Cost
of sales’, 4 million Swiss francs (2011: none) in ‘Marketing and Distribution’, 98 million Swiss francs (2011: 71 million Swiss
francs) in ‘Research and development’ and 305 million Swiss francs in ‘General and administration’ (2011: none).
In 2012 no income was received from insurance companies in respect of impairments to property, plant and equipment
(2011: 24 million Swiss francs). In 2012 no borrowing costs were capitalised as property, plant and equipment (2011: none).
Leasing arrangements where the Group is the lessee
Finance leases. As at 31 December 2012 the capitalised cost of property, plant and equipment under finance leases was
327 million Swiss francs (2011: 314 million Swiss francs) and the net book value of these assets was 159 million Swiss francs
(2011: 181 million Swiss francs). The carrying value of the leasing obligation was 203 million Swiss francs (2011: 225 million
Swiss francs), which is reported as part of Debt (see Note 26).

Goodwill impairment testing
Pharmaceuticals Division. The division’s sub-divisions are the cash-generating units used for the testing of goodwill.
For Chugai, the recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs to sell, determined with reference to the publicly quoted
share prices of Chugai shares. For Roche Pharmaceuticals, the recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is based
on value in use. The cash flow projections used for Roche Pharmaceuticals impairment testing are based on the most recent
business plans approved by management. The business plans include management’s latest estimates on sales volume and
pricing, and production and other operating costs and assumes no significant changes in the organisation.
94
Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsThe business plans are projected over five years. These valuations include a terminal value beyond these years, assuming
no further growth. The discount rate used is based on an after-tax rate of 6.4%, which is derived from a capital asset pricing
model using data from capital markets, including government twenty-year bonds. A weighted average tax rate of 25.5% is
used in the calculations and the corresponding pre-tax discount rate is 8.6%.
Diagnostics Division. The division’s business areas are the cash-generating units used for the testing of goodwill. The
goodwill arising from the Corange/Boehringer Mannheim acquisition and part of the goodwill from the Ventana acquisition
is recorded and monitored at a divisional level as it relates to the strategic development of the whole division and cannot
be meaningfully allocated to the division’s business areas. Therefore the cash-generating unit for this goodwill is the entire
division.
The recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is based on value in use and the cash flow projections are based
on the most recent business plans approved by management. The business plans include management’s latest estimates
on sales volume and pricing, and production and other operating costs. The business plans assume no further significant
changes in the organisation beyond the Applied Science restructuring explained below.
The business plans are projected over five years, except for the Tissue Diagnostics business area which is projected over
ten years reflecting the long-term nature of this business. These valuations include a terminal value beyond these years,
assuming no further growth. The discount rate used is based on an after-tax rate of 6.4%, which is derived from a capital
asset pricing model using data from capital markets, including government twenty-year bonds. A weighted average tax
rate of 15.9% is used in the calculations and the corresponding pre-tax discount rate is 7.7%.
The Diagnostics Division announced several global restructuring initiatives in 2012, as disclosed in Note 7. As part of the
plan for streamlining the product portfolio in the Applied Science business, the division is exiting the Microarray business.
The Microarray business was acquired in 2007 through the acquisition of NimbleGen. As a result of this decision the
Microarray business is no longer considered to be part of the Applied Science business area cash-generating unit for
assessing goodwill impairment. Given the plan to exit the Microarray business the goodwill which arose from the NimbleGen
acquisition was considered to be fully impaired and a charge of 187 million Swiss francs was recorded. The remaining
goodwill of 34 million Swiss francs in the Applied Science business area is supported by the value in use of the on-going
business and is dependent on the success of the plan to streamline the product portfolio.
Goodwill sensitivity analysis
Management has performed sensitivity analyses for both Roche Pharmaceuticals and the Diagnostics Division which
increased the discount rate by 1% combined with decreasing the forecast cash flows by 5%. The results of the sensitivity
analyses demonstrated that the above changes in the key assumptions would not cause the carrying value of goodwill
to exceed the recoverable amount.

Internally generated intangible assets
The Group currently has no internally generated intangible assets from development as the criteria for the recognition
as an asset are not met.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
The Group currently has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Intangible assets not available for use
These mostly represent in-process research and development assets acquired either through in-licensing arrangements,
business combinations or separate purchases. As at 31 December 2012 the carrying value of such assets in the Pharmaceuticals
Division is 1,287 million Swiss francs. Of this amount approximately 98% represents projects that have potential decision
points within the next twelve months which in certain circumstances could lead to impairment. Due to the inherent
uncertainties in the research and development processes, intangible assets not available for use are particularly at risk
of impairment if the project in question does not result in a commercialised product.
Intangible asset impairment
Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposal. Factors such as the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence or lower than
anticipated sales for products with capitalised rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
Intangible asset impairment charges – 2012
Total impairment charges during 2012 were 525 million Swiss francs, of which 489 million Swiss francs were in the Roche
Pharmaceuticals operating segment and 36 million Swiss francs in the Diagnostics operating segment.
97
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Pharmaceuticals Division. Impairment charges totalling 158 million Swiss francs arose from the various global restructuring
initiatives disclosed in Note 7. Following the recent dalcetrapib trial results, impairment charges of 112 million Swiss francs
were incurred in respect of previously acquired intangible assets. Additionally impairment charges of 46 million Swiss francs
were recorded following a portfolio prioritisation decision as part of the reorganisation of research and development in the
Pharmaceuticals Division. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully written down.
Impairment charges of 103 million Swiss francs were recorded following a portfolio prioritisation decision by the
Pharmaceuticals Division. This relates to a decision to return the global rights to the monoclonal antibody RG 7334 anti-PLGF
MAb to the alliance partners. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully written down by these
charges.
Impairment charges of 162 million Swiss francs were recorded following the latest clinical data assessment of a project
acquired as part of the Marcadia acquisition. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were written down
to their recoverable value of 31 million Swiss francs.
Following recent clinical data, further impairment charges of 53 million Swiss francs were recorded in respect of projects
in collaboration with alliance partners. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully written down
by these charges. In addition, impairment charges of 13 million Swiss francs were recorded, which relate to a decision to
stop development of one compound with an alliance partner. The assets concerned, which were being amortised, were fully
written down by these charges.
Diagnostics Division. Impairment charges of 36 million Swiss francs were recorded, which includes 29 million Swiss
francs from global restructuring initiatives in the Applied Science and Diabetes Care businesses (see Note 7). The assets
concerned, which had been partly amortised, were written down to their recoverable value of 2 million Swiss francs.
Intangible asset impairment charges – 2011
Total impairment charges during 2011 were 138 million Swiss francs, of which 79 million Swiss francs were in the Roche
Pharmaceuticals operating segment and 59 million Swiss francs in the Diagnostics operating segment.
Pharmaceuticals Division. An impairment charge of 32 million Swiss francs was recorded related to a decision to stop the
development of a project acquired in a business combination that had been out-licensed to an alliance partner. The assets
concerned, which had been partly amortised, were written down to their recoverable value of 29 million Swiss francs. Further
charges of 47 million Swiss francs were recorded, resulting from portfolio prioritisation decisions on projects acquired
separately or as part of a business combination. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully
written down by these charges.
Diagnostics Division. An impairment charge of 59 million Swiss francs was recorded mainly in respect of intangible assets
in use. This followed the regular updating of the division’s business plans and technology assessments in the second half
of 2011. The assets concerned were written down to their recoverable amount of 14 million Swiss francs.
Potential commitments from alliance collaborations
The Group is party to in-licensing and similar arrangements with its alliance partners. These arrangements may require
the Group to make certain milestone or other similar payments dependent upon the achievement of agreed objectives or
performance targets as defined in the collaboration agreements.
The Group’s current estimate of future third-party commitments for such payments is set out in the table below. These
figures are undiscounted and are not risk adjusted, meaning that they include all such potential payments that can arise
assuming all projects currently in development are successful. The timing is based on the Group’s current best estimate.
These figures do not include any potential commitments within the Group, such as may arise between the Roche and Chugai
businesses.

Financial long-term assets are held for strategic purposes and are classified as non-current. The available-for-sale
investments are mainly equity investments. These are primarily investments in private biotechnology companies, which are
kept as part of the Group’s strategic alliance efforts. Some unquoted equity investments classified as available-for-sale
are measured at cost, as their fair value cannot be measured reliably. The carrying value of equity investments held at cost
is 57 million Swiss francs (2011: 53 million Swiss francs, 2010: 39 million Swiss francs). Loans receivable comprise all loans
to third parties with a term of over one year.

Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements23. Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments as part of its risk management activities. This is discussed in Note 31.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value. The methods used for determining fair value are described in Note 1.

Hedge accounting
The Group’s accounting policy on hedge accounting, which is described in Note 1, requires that to qualify for hedge
accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge
effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
As described in Note 31, the Group has financial risk management policies for foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk,
market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. When deemed appropriate, certain of the above risks are managed by using
derivatives. While many of these transactions can be considered as hedges in economic terms, if the required conditions are
not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged
item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship, which means that any derivatives are reported at
fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial income.
The Group generally limits the use of hedge accounting to certain significant transactions. Consequently as at 31 December
2012 the Group has no fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investment in a foreign entity that meet the strict
requirements to qualify for hedge accounting, apart from those described below.
Cash flow hedges
The Group has issued bonds and notes in 2009 to finance the Genentech transaction (see Note 26). On some of the bonds
and notes which are denominated in euros and sterling, the Group has entered into cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign
exchange and interest rate risk. As at 31 December 2012 such instruments, which are designated and qualify for hedge
accounting, are recorded as assets with a fair value of 418 million Swiss francs (2011: assets of 178 million Swiss francs).
There was no ineffective portion.
During 2012 the Group entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a part of its foreign translation exposure
to euros. As at 31 December 2012 such instruments, which are designated and qualify for hedge accounting, are recorded
as liabilities with a fair value of 10 million Swiss francs. There was no ineffective portion.

The changes in the hedging reserve within equity are shown in Note 27.
Fair value hedges
During 2011 the Group entered into some interest rate swaps to hedge some of its fixed-term debt instruments. These
instruments, which had been designated and qualified as fair value hedges, were recorded in the balance sheet at
31 December 2012 as assets with a fair value of 5 million Swiss francs (2011: assets of 9 million Swiss francs). During 2012
a loss of 4 million Swiss francs was recorded on these interest rate swaps (2011: gain of 9 million Swiss francs). As the fair
value hedge had been highly effective since inception, the result of the interest rate swaps was largely offset by changes
in the fair value of the hedged debt instruments.
The Group has equity investments in various biotechnology companies that are subject to a greater risk of market fluctuation
than the stock market in general. To manage part of this exposure the Group has entered into forward contracts, which
have been designated and qualify as fair value hedges. As at 31 December 2012 such instruments are recorded as liabilities
with a fair value of 106 million Swiss francs (2011: liabilities of 62 million Swiss francs). During 2012 a loss of 44 million Swiss
francs was recorded on these forward contracts (2011: loss of 55 million Swiss francs). The result of the forward contracts
is offset by the changes in the fair value of the hedged equity investments.
The Group uses other derivatives, not designated in a qualifying hedge relationship, to manage its exposures to foreign
currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. The instruments used may include interest rate swaps, cross-currency
swaps, forwards contracts, options.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Legal provisions
Legal provisions consist of a number of separate legal matters, including claims arising from trade, in various Group
companies. The majority of any cash outflows for these other matters are expected to occur within the next one to three
years, although these are dependent on the development of the various litigations. Significant provisions are discounted
by between 4% and 5% where the time value of money is material.
Legal expenses during 2012 totalled 72 million Swiss francs (2011: 74 million Swiss francs) which reflect the recent
developments in various legal matters. Details of the major legal cases outstanding are disclosed below.
Environmental provisions
Provisions for environmental matters include various separate environmental issues in a number of countries. By their nature
the amounts and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict. The estimated timings of these cash outflows are shown
in the table above. Significant provisions are discounted by between 4% and 6% where the time value of money is material.
As disclosed in Note 7, the restructuring plan to streamline the research and development activities within the Pharmaceuticals
Division includes the closure of the US site in Nutley, New Jersey. An expense of 243 million Swiss francs was recorded
based on estimates of the additional remediation activities that may be needed before the Nutley site can be sold. Further
expenses were also recorded for an increase in the estimated remediation costs for a landfill site near Grenzach, Germany,
that was used by manufacturing operations that were closed some years ago.
Restructuring provisions
These arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of business undertaken by the Group or the manner
in which business is conducted. Such provisions include only the costs necessarily entailed by the restructuring which are
not associated with the recurring activities of the Group. The timings of these cash outflows are reasonably certain on a
global basis and are shown in the table above. These provisions are not discounted as the time value of money is not material
in these matters.
The restructuring provisions created in 2012 are primarily related to the plan to streamline the research and development
activities within the Pharmaceuticals Division, mainly related to the closure of the US site in Nutley, New Jersey.
Employee provisions
These mostly relate to certain employee benefit obligations, such as sabbatical leave and long-service benefits.
The timings of these cash outflows can be reasonably estimated based on past performance and are shown in the table
above. Significant provisions are discounted by 6% where the time value of money is material.
Other provisions
The timings of cash outflows are by their nature uncertain and the best estimates are shown in the table below. Significant
provisions are discounted by between 2% and 6% where the time value of money is material.

Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsContingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees, to be affected by political,
legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating to environmental protection, in the countries in
which it operates. The industries in which the Group operates are also subject to other risks of various kinds. The nature
and frequency of these developments and events, not all of which are covered by insurance, as well as their effect on future
operations and earnings, are not predictable.
The Group has entered into strategic alliances with various companies in order to gain access to potential new products or
to utilise other companies to help develop the Group’s own potential new products. Potential future payments may become
due to certain collaboration partners achieving certain milestones as defined in the collaboration agreements. The Group’s
best estimates of future commitments for such payments are given in Note 13.
Pharmaceuticals legal cases
Accutane. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (‘HLR’) and various other Roche affiliates have been named as defendants in numerous
legal actions in the United States and elsewhere relating to the acne medication Accutane. The litigation alleges that
Accutane caused certain serious conditions, including, but not limited to, inflammatory bowel disease (‘IBD’), birth defects
and psychiatric disorders. As of 31 December 2012 HLR was defending approximately 7,830 actions involving approximately
7,920 plaintiffs brought in various federal and state courts throughout the United States for personal injuries allegedly
resulting from their use of Accutane. Most of the actions allege IBD as a result of Accutane use. On 26 June 2009 HLR
announced that, following a re-evaluation of its portfolio of medicines that are now available from generic manufacturers,
rapidly declining brand sales in the US and high costs from personal-injury lawsuits that it continues to defend vigorously,
it had decided to immediately discontinue the manufacture and distribution of the product in the United States.
All of the actions pending in federal court alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District
Litigation in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division. Since July 2007 the District
Court has granted summary judgment in favour of HLR for all of the federal IBD cases that have proceeded. Since August
2008 all of these rulings have been affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit when plaintiffs
appealed. Multiple recently filed matters remain pending.
All of the actions pending in state court in New Jersey alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the
Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County. As of 31 December 2012 juries in the Superior Court have ruled
in favour of the plaintiff in eight cases, assessing total compensatory damages totalling 67.7 million US dollars, and ruled in
favour of HLR in four cases. For the eight cases that were originally ruled in favour of the plaintiff by the Superior Court, HLR
is in the process of appealing two cases (27.4 million US dollars); one case is scheduled for a retrial in April 2013 (10.5 million
US dollars); post-trial briefing is on-going for two cases (18.0 million US dollars); and three cases have had their verdicts
reversed in favour of HLR (11.8 million US dollars).
In May 2012 a trial involving four plaintiffs reached defence verdicts in two of the cases and awarded compensatory damages
of 9.0 million US dollars in each of the other two cases; the cases are in post-trial briefing. In August 2012 the New Jersey
Appellate Division reversed three 2008 verdicts in favour of plaintiffs in the amount of 11.8 million US dollars and directed
that final judgment be entered for HLR. The Court held that, under controlling Florida case law, HLR was entitled to judgment
because the prescribing physicians testified that they would have still prescribed Accutane even in the face of the plaintiffs’
proposed different warnings; thus, plaintiffs could not establish their respective cases. The New Jersey Supreme Court
declined the plaintiffs’ request to review the decision.
Additional trials may be scheduled for 2013. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including many that are
unique to the particular case and therefore the trial results to date may not be predictive of future trial results. The Group
continues to defend vigorously the remaining personal injury cases and claims.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Cabilly patents. On 8 October 2009 Glaxo Group Limited, SmithKline Beecham Corporation, and GlaxoSmithKline LLC
(collectively ‘GSK’) filed a patent lawsuit against Genentech and City of Hope in the US District Court for the Southern
District of Florida. The lawsuit related to US Patent No. 6,331,415 (‘the Cabilly II patent’) that is co-owned by Genentech and
the City of Hope. On 17 February 2010 GSK dismissed its Florida lawsuit in its entirety and filed a related action on the same
day in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, which was subsequently transferred to the Central District
of California. In the lawsuit, GSK was seeking a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity and unenforceability with regard to
the Cabilly II patent and of patent non-infringement with regard to GSK’s Arzerra product.
In the first half of 2011 additional lawsuits between Genentech and GSK and/or Human Genome Sciences, Inc. (‘HGS’) involving
the Cabilly II patent and related US Patent No. 7,923,221 (‘the Cabilly III patent’) were filed in the US District Courts for the
District of Delaware and the Central District of California. The lawsuits filed in Delaware were subsequently transferred to
the Central District of California. The additional lawsuits included claims by GSK and/or HGS that the Cabilly patents are not
infringed, are invalid, and are unenforceable, and that Genentech violated antitrust and unfair competition laws, and other laws,
and claims by Genentech that GSK’s Arzerra product and GSK’s and HGS’s Benlysta product infringed the Cabilly patents.
On 26 March 2012 the parties agreed to a settlement of the claims in these lawsuits relating to the Arzerra product.
On 18 December 2012 the parties agreed to a settlement of all the remaining claims in these lawsuits, including those related
to the Benlysta product. All of these matters are now concluded.
Rituxan arbitration (Sanofi/Hoechst). On 27 October 2008 Genentech and Biogen Idec Inc. filed a complaint against
Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH (‘Sanofi’), Sanofi-Aventis US LLC and Sanofi-Aventis US Inc. in the Northern District of
California seeking a declaratory judgment that certain Genentech products, including Rituxan, do not infringe Sanofi’s US
Patents 5,849,522 and 6,218,140 and a declaratory judgment that the ‘522 and ‘140 patents are invalid. Also on 27 October
2008 Sanofi filed suit against Genentech and Biogen Idec in the Eastern District of Texas, Lufkin Division, claiming that
Rituxan and at least eight other Genentech products infringe the ‘522 and ‘140 patents. Sanofi requested preliminary and
permanent injunctions, compensatory and exemplary damages, and other relief. Subsequently the Texas and California cases
were consolidated in the Northern District of California. On 7 March 2011 the District Court ruled that as a matter of law
Genentech and Biogen Idec do not infringe any of the asserted patent claims. On 18 May 2011 Sanofi filed a notice of appeal
of the Court’s non-infringement ruling and its claim construction order. The appellate court affirmed the District Court’s
judgment that the Rituxan product does not infringe any of the claims of either of those patents.
In addition on 24 October 2008 Hoechst GmbH filed with the ICC International Court of Arbitration (Paris) a request for
arbitration with Genentech, relating to a terminated agreement between one of Hoechst’s predecessors and Genentech
that pertained to the above patents and related patents outside the United States. Hoechst is seeking payment of royalties
on sales of Genentech products, damages for breach of contract, and other relief. In June 2011 the ICC arbitrator issued
an intermediate decision indicating that Rituxan is covered by the terminated agreement and ordering that Genentech
produce certain Rituxan sales information from December 1998 to October 2008. The Group expects that the arbitrator
would use this information, and possibly other information, to determine the amount of damages to be awarded to Hoechst.
At 31 December 2011 the Group recorded a back royalty expense of 61 million Swiss francs, net of the assumed
reimbursement of a portion of the Group’s obligation by its co-promotion partner in the US, and a corresponding amount in
accrued liabilities. At 31 December 2012 the amount that was accrued in 2011 continues to represent management’s best
estimate of the compensatory damages, including interest, which may be awarded to Hoechst based on the financial terms of
the terminated agreement. The final amount of the decision may vary from the amounts provided if the nature and/or extent
of the damages awarded to Hoechst differ from the Group’s estimate or if Genentech successfully challenges the arbitrator’s
decision. On 11 July 2011 Genentech filed a Declaration of Appeal with the Court of Appeal of Paris to initiate legal proceedings
challenging the arbitrator’s decision. The arbitrator subsequently stated to the parties that his June 2011 decision ‘did not
decide in the operative part the underlying issue of liability with respect of Rituxan’. In light of that statement, Genentech did
not pursue its previously filed action to challenge the arbitrator’s decision (without prejudicing its ability to bring a challenge
in the future). In March 2012 Genentech completed briefing on liability, and on the amount owed under the license agreement
if the arbitrator were to find liability. On 5 September 2012 the arbitrator issued a decision indicating that Genentech is liable
to Hoechst for certain damages yet to be determined. On 29 November 2012 the arbitrator held a hearing on the amount
of damages that Genentech may owe to Hoechst. The arbitrator has not yet issued a decision regarding damages. On
10 December 2012 Genentech filed a Declaration of Appeal with the Court of Appeal of Paris to initiate legal proceedings
challenging the arbitrator’s decision.
108
Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsOn 1 May 2012 Genentech filed a motion in the US District Court seeking to enjoin Sanofi and its affiliates (e.g. Hoechst)
from pursuing an award in the ICC arbitration that would undermine and be contrary to the US courts’ final judgment of no
infringement. The District Court denied that motion, and Genentech appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit. The appeal hearing was held on 8 January 2013 and a decision is expected later in 2013.
The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Average Wholesale Prices litigation. HLR and Roche Laboratories Inc. (‘RLI’), along with approximately 50 other brand
and generic pharmaceutical companies, have been named as defendants in several legal actions in the United States relating
to the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs and State Medicaid reimbursement. The primary allegation in these litigations is that
the pharmaceutical companies misrepresented or otherwise reported inaccurate Average Wholesale Prices (‘AWP’) and/
or Wholesale Acquisition Costs (‘WAC’) for their drugs, which prices were allegedly relied upon by the States in calculating
Medicaid reimbursements to entities such as retail pharmacies. The States, through their respective Attorney General,
are seeking repayment of the amounts they claim were over-reimbursed. The time period associated with these cases is
1991–2005. As of 31 December 2012 HLR and RLI are defending one AWP action filed in the state of New Jersey. Discovery
is currently pending in this case. HLR and RLI are vigorously defending themselves in this matter. The outcome of this matter
cannot be determined at this time.
Brand Name Prescription Drugs litigations. HLR, along with various other branded pharmaceutical companies, has been
named as a defendant in several legal actions in the United States brought by retail pharmacies relating to the discounting
practices for Brand Name Prescription Drugs (‘BNPD’). In these BNPD litigations, the plaintiffs allege that they were denied
discounts for certain prescription drugs that were offered to other mail order and managed care entities, which denial is
claimed to be a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act (‘RPA’). The RPA is a Federal law that prohibits unlawful price
discrimination. In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants conspired in their refusal to offer them certain discounts.
The conspiracy claims against all defendants were previously settled, with only the RPA claims remaining to be litigated. As of
31 December 2012 HLR and RLI have successfully obtained dismissals of all BNPD cases and are no longer defending these
matters. This matter is now concluded.
University of Pennsylvania litigation. On 11 May 2010 Genentech filed a patent lawsuit against the University of
Pennsylvania in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit related to US Patent No. 6,733,752
and sought a declaratory judgment of patent non-infringement and invalidity with regard to that patent. On 12 July 2010
the University counterclaimed against Genentech for infringement of the ‘752 patent, seeking unspecified damages based
on the sales of Herceptin. On 9 May 2011 the Court issued a claim construction order, construing certain terms used in
claims of the ‘752 patent. On 7 June 2012 the parties entered into a binding term sheet to settle the litigation and the parties
dismissed the case by stipulation. This matter is now concluded.
PDL litigation. On 27 August 2010 PDL Biopharma (‘PDL’) filed a complaint against Genentech in Nevada state Court
seeking a judicial declaration concerning Genentech’s obligation to pay royalties on certain ex-US sales of Herceptin,
Avastin, Xolair and Lucentis under a 2003 agreement between the parties. On 13 September 2010 PDL filed a first amended
complaint asserting additional claims against Genentech, including breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant
of good faith and fair dealing. PDL also asserted new claims against Roche and Novartis for intentional interference with
contractual relations. In addition to declaratory relief, PDL is seeking monetary damages including compensatory and
liquidated damages. On 1 November 2010 Genentech and Roche filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and
Roche filed an additional motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. On 7 July 2011 the Court denied the motions.
PDL settled its claim against Novartis. Fact discovery between the other parties is on-going and is expected to be completed
in March 2013 and the trial is currently scheduled for October 2013.
In addition to the litigation, PDL conducted a royalty audit related to sales of Avastin, Herceptin, Lucentis, Xolair and Raptiva
for the years 2007 through 2009. On 22 October 2012 the Group received from PDL a copy of the independent auditor’s
final audit report. The audit report indicates that under PDL’s interpretation of certain contract terms, Genentech owes PDL
additional royalties for the audit period (and under the same interpretation Genentech may owe additional royalties for years
subsequent to the audit period). The Group disputes PDL’s interpretation of the relevant contract terms and does not believe
that additional royalties are owed.
The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012GSK litigation. On 20 September 2010 GSK and Genentech each filed patent lawsuits against one another (and in the
case of GSK, also against Roche Holding Ltd) in US District Courts for the District of Delaware and the Northern District
of California, respectively. The lawsuits concern GSK’s US Patent Nos. RE41,070 and RE41,555. GSK has asserted claims
against Genentech and Roche alleging infringement of the ‘070 and ‘555 patents by certain ‘therapeutic antibody products’,
although the complaint only specifically refers to Herceptin. In its lawsuit Genentech is seeking a judicial declaration of
non-infringement by certain Genentech products. In the Delaware action on 12 November 2010 Genentech filed a motion
to dismiss for failure to state a claim and a motion to transfer the case to California. Roche filed a motion to dismiss for lack
of personal jurisdiction. The parties subsequently stipulated to Roche’s dismissal and only Genentech remains a party. On
29 March 2012 the Delaware Court denied Genentech’s motion to transfer the case to California. On 12 June 2012 the parties
agreed to dismiss the California action without prejudice and the case will now proceed in Delaware. The outcome of these
matters cannot be determined at this time.
Boniva litigation. HLR, Genentech and various other Roche affiliates (collectively ‘Roche’) have been named as defendants
in numerous legal actions in the United States and Canada relating to the post-menopausal osteoporosis medication Boniva.
In these litigations, the plaintiffs allege that Boniva caused either osteonecrosis of the jaw (‘ONJ’) or atypical femoral
fractures. As of 31 December 2012 HLR is defending approximately 245 actions involving approximately 284 plaintiffs brought
in federal and state courts throughout the United States and one action brought in the Court of the Queen’s Bench, Province
of Saskatchewan, Canada, for personal injuries allegedly resulting from the use of Boniva. All of these cases are in the early
discovery stages of litigation. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including many that are unique to the
particular case. Roche is vigorously defending itself in these matters. The outcome of these matters cannot be determined
at this time.
EMA investigation. On 23 October 2012 the European Medicines Agency (‘EMA’) announced that it would start an
infringement procedure to investigate allegations regarding an alleged breach of medicines safety reporting obligations in
relation to 19 centrally authorised medicines. This investigation will take up to 18 months to conclude. Based on the data
reviewed and submitted to the EMA to date, no impact on the safety profiles of any of the products has been found. To date,
the EMA and other health authorities have confirmed all medicines remain authorised without changes to the treatment
advice for patients and healthcare professionals. All corrective and preventative actions resulting from the inspections have
been completed and newly defined processes are being implemented, which will become routine practice. The outcome
of this investigation cannot be determined at this time.
Diagnostics legal cases
Marsh Supermarkets litigation. On 8 July 2008 Marsh Supermarkets Inc. (‘Marsh’) filed a breach of contract suit against
Roche Diagnostics Operations, Inc. (‘RDO’). The lawsuit relates to the termination of a sub-lease agreement for a building
by RDO. After extensive argument during a bench trial a Hamilton Superior Court judge awarded Marsh damages amounting
to 19.5 million US dollars, which has been accrued for as a legal provision in 2011. RDO has appealed this judgment and
a decision is expected in the first half of 2013. The outcome of this appeal cannot be determined at this time.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Redemption and repurchase of bonds and notes – 2012
Redemption of Swiss franc-denominated notes. On the due date of 23 March 2012 the Group redeemed notes with
a principal amount outstanding of 2,198 million Swiss francs at the original issue amount plus accrued original issue discount.
The effective interest rate of these notes was 2.88%. The cash outflow was 2,198 million Swiss francs and there was no gain
or loss recorded on the redemption.
Partial repurchase of euro-denominated notes. On 23 March 2012 the Group completed a tender offer for a nominal
amount of 782 million euros of the 4.625% fixed rate notes due 4 March 2013 with a total principal amount outstanding of
4,288 million euros. The cash outflow was 981 million Swiss francs, plus accrued interest. The loss on repurchase of the
notes was 39 million Swiss francs. On 30 November 2012 the Group completed a tender offer for a nominal amount of
193 million euros of the 4.625% fixed rate notes due 4 March 2013 with a total principal amount outstanding of 3,506 million
euros. The cash outflow was 235 million Swiss francs, plus accrued interest. The loss on repurchase of the notes was
3 million Swiss francs. In addition the Group terminated the currency swaps that were used to hedge the foreign currency
risk on the euro-denominated notes. This created an additional loss of 7 million Swiss francs, reflecting the change in fair
value of the hedging derivatives due to changes in interest rates. The total loss on repurchases of 49 million Swiss francs
was recorded within financing costs (see Note 4). The effective interest rate of the notes repurchased was 5.53%.
Partial repurchase of euro-denominated notes. On 30 November 2012 the Group completed a tender offer for a nominal
amount of 650 million euros of the 5.625% fixed rate notes due 4 March 2016 with a total principal amount outstanding of
2.75 billion euros. The cash outflow was 912 million Swiss francs, plus accrued interest. The loss on repurchase of the notes
was 135 million Swiss francs. In addition the Group terminated the currency swaps that were used to hedge the foreign
currency risk on the euro-denominated notes. This created an additional loss of 5 million Swiss francs, reflecting the change
in fair value of the hedging derivatives due to changes in interest rates. The total loss on repurchase of 140 million Swiss
francs was recorded within financing costs (see Note 4). The effective interest rate of the notes repurchased was 6.36%.
Early redemption of US dollar-denominated notes in 2013. On 20 December 2012 the Group resolved to exercise its
option to call for redemption of the entire outstanding US dollar-denominated 5.0% fixed rate notes due 1 March 2014. The
Group will redeem the remaining outstanding principal of 1.75 billion US dollars on 21 March 2013 at an amount equal to
the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of these notes discounted to the redemption date at
the US Treasury rate plus 0.50%, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal. The US Treasury rate will be
determined by an independent investment banker on the third business day preceding the redemption. A cash outflow of
approximately 1,821 million US dollars, plus accrued interest, is expected on redemption. The Group has revised the carrying
value of these notes to take into account the changes to the amounts and timings of the estimated cash flows. The revised
carrying value of these notes at 31 December 2012 is 1,820 million US dollars (1,667 million Swiss francs). The increase in
carrying value of 74 million US dollars (70 million Swiss francs) is recorded within financing costs (see Note 4) as a loss on
redemption. The effective interest rate of these notes is 4.85%.
Redemption and repurchase of bonds and notes – 2011
Redemption of US dollar-denominated notes. On the due date of 25 February 2011 the Group redeemed notes with
a principal of 931 million US dollars at the original issue amount plus accrued original issue discount. The effective interest
rate of these notes was 3 months LIBOR plus 2.10%. The cash outflow was 862 million Swiss francs and there was no gain
or loss recorded on the redemption.
Partial early redemption of US dollar-denominated notes. On 28 December 2010 the Group resolved to exercise its
option to call for redemption a portion of the US dollar-denominated 5.00% fixed rate notes due 1 March 2014. The Group
redeemed 1.0 billion US dollars of the total principal amount of 2.75 billion US dollars of these notes on 24 March 2011 at
an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of these notes discounted to the
redemption date at the US Treasury rate plus 0.50%, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal. The cash
outflow was 999 million Swiss francs, plus accrued interest. As at 31 December 2010 the Group had already revised the
carrying value of these notes to take into account the changes to the amounts and timings of the estimated cash flow. The
increase in carrying value of 108 million Swiss francs was recorded within financing costs in 2010. An additional loss of 2 million
Swiss francs was incurred in 2011 upon final settlement of the notes. The effective interest rate of these notes was 5.31%.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Collateral arrangements
The Group has entered into various currency swaps for certain non-US dollar debt instruments that were issued in 2009.
Collateral agreements were entered into with the counterparties to the currency swaps to mitigate counterparty risk. As the
fair value of the derivative instruments increased during 2012, mainly due to a strengthening of the euro compared to the
US dollar, a total of 0.2 billion Swiss francs cash collateral was delivered to the Group during the year (2011: 0.1 billion Swiss
francs delivered to the Group). This collateral delivered was recorded as an increase in cash and a corresponding increase
in accrued liabilities. The carrying value of accrued liabilities in respect of these agreements at 31 December 2012 was
0.4 billion Swiss francs (31 December 2011: accrued liabilities of 0.2 billion Swiss francs).
Commercial paper
Roche Holdings, Inc. commercial paper program. In March 2009 Roche Holdings, Inc. established a commercial paper
program under which it can issue up to 7.5 billion US dollars of unsecured commercial paper notes guaranteed by Roche
Holding Ltd. A committed credit line of 3.9 billion euros is available as a back-stop line. The maturity of the notes under the
program cannot exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. As at 31 December 2012 unsecured commercial paper notes
with a principal amount of 355 million US dollars and an average interest rate of 0.13% were outstanding. These amounts
were due at various dates until 25 January 2013.

a) The entire gains transferred to income statement of 106 million Swiss francs were reported as ‘Financial income’.
The Group completed the purchase of the non-controlling interests in Genentech effective 26 March 2009. Based on
the revised International Accounting Standard 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ (IAS 27), which was
adopted by the Group in 2008, this transaction was accounted for in full as an equity transaction. As a consequence,
the carrying amount of the consolidated equity of the Group at that time was reduced by 52.2 billion Swiss francs, of which
8.5 billion Swiss francs was allocated to eliminate the book value of Genentech non-controlling interests. This accounting
effect significantly impacted the Group’s net equity, but has no effect on the Group’s business or its dividend policy.

Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsShare capital
As of 31 December 2012, the authorised and issued share capital of Roche Holding Ltd, which is the Group’s parent
company, consisted of 160,000,000 shares with a nominal value of 1.00 Swiss franc each, as in the preceding year. The
shares are bearer shares and the Group does not maintain a register of shareholders. Based on information supplied to
the Group, a shareholder group with pooled voting rights owns 45.01% (2011: 45.01%) of the issued shares. On 24 March
2011 the shareholder group announced that it would continue the shareholder pooling agreement existing since 1948
with a modified shareholder composition. The shareholder group with pooled voting rights now holds 72,018,000 shares,
corresponding to 45.01% of the shares issued. This figure does not include any shares without pooled voting rights that
are held outside this group by individual members of the group. Ms Maja Oeri, formerly a member of the pool, holds now
8,091,900 shares representing 5.057% of the voting rights independently of the pool. This is further described in Note 32.
Based on information supplied to the Group, Novartis Ltd, Basel, and its affiliates own 33.3330% (participation below 331⁄%)
3
of the issued shares (2011: 33.3330%).
Non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
As of 31 December 2012, 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities have been authorised and were in issue as in the
preceding year. Under Swiss company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value, are not part of the
share capital and cannot be issued against a contribution which would be shown as an asset in the balance sheet of Roche
Holding Ltd. Each non-voting equity security confers the same rights as any of the shares to participate in the net profit
and any remaining proceeds from liquidation following repayment of the nominal value of the shares and, if any, participation
certificates. In accordance with the law and the Articles of Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd, the Company is entitled at
all times to exchange all or some of the non-voting equity securities into shares or participation certificates.
Dividends
On 6 March 2012 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of 6.80 Swiss francs per share and non-voting
equity securities (2011: 6.60 Swiss francs) in respect of the 2011 business year. The distribution to holders of outstanding
shares and non-voting equity securities totalled 5,770 million Swiss francs (2011: 5,614 million Swiss francs) and has been
recorded against retained earnings in 2012. The Board of Directors has proposed dividends for the 2012 business year
of 7.35 Swiss francs per share and non-voting equity security which, if approved, would result in a total distribution to
shareholders of 6,340 million Swiss francs. This is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 5 March 2013.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Non-voting equity securities and derivative instruments are held for the Group’s potential conversion obligations that may
arise from the Roche Option Plan, Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights and Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan
(see Note 10). These mainly consist of call options that are exercisable at any time up to their maturity.
The Group holds none of its own shares.
Reserves
Fair value reserve. The fair value reserve represents the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale financial
assets until the asset is sold, impaired or otherwise disposed of.
Hedging reserve. The hedging reserve represents the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash
flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
Translation reserve. The translation reserve represents the cumulative currency translation differences relating to the
consolidation of Group companies that use functional currencies other than Swiss francs.
28. Earnings per share and non-voting equity security
Basic earnings per share and non-voting equity security
For the calculation of basic earnings per share and non-voting equity security, the number of shares and non-voting equity
securities is reduced by the weighted average number of its own non-voting equity securities held by the Group during
the period.

Net income attributable to Roche shareholders (CHF millions) 9,539 9,343

Basic earnings per share and non-voting equity security (CHF) 11.25 11.01
Diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security, the net income and weighted average
number of shares and non-voting equity securities outstanding are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential shares and
non-voting equity securities.
Potential dilutive effects arise from the employee stock option plans. The exercise of outstanding vested employee stock
options would have a dilutive effect. The exercise of the outstanding vested Chugai stock options would have a dilutive effect
if the net income of Chugai were positive. The diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security reflects the potential
impacts of these dilutive effects on the earnings per share figures.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 201230. Statement of cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities arise from the Group’s primary activities in the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics
businesses. These are calculated by the indirect method by adjusting the Group’s operating profit for any operating income
and expenses that are not cash flows (for example depreciation, amortisation and impairment) in order to derive the cash
generated from operations. This and other operating cash flows are shown in the statement of cash flows. Operating cash
flows also include income taxes paid on all activities.

Cash flows from investing activities are principally those arising from the Group’s investments in property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets, and from the acquisition and divestment of subsidiaries, associates and businesses. Cash
flows connected with the Group’s portfolio of marketable securities and other investments are also included, as are any
interest and dividend payments received in respect of these securities and investments. These cash flows indicate the Group’s
net reinvestment in its operating assets and the cash flow effects of business combinations and divestments, as well as the
cash generated by the Group’s other investments.

Cash flows from financing activities are primarily the proceeds from the issue and repayment of the Group’s equity and debt
instruments. They also include interest payments and dividend payments on these instruments. Cash flows from short-term
financing, including finance leases, are also included. These cash flows indicate the Group’s transactions with the providers
of its equity and debt financing. Cash flows from short-term borrowings are shown as a net movement, as these consist of
a large number of transactions with short maturity.

31. Risk management
Group risk management
Risk management is a fundamental element of the Group’s business practice on all levels and encompasses different types
of risks. At a group level risk management is an integral part of the business planning and controlling processes. Material
risks are monitored and regularly discussed with the Corporate Executive Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board
of Directors. Financial risk management specifically is described in further detail below.
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising from its underlying operations and corporate finance activities.
The Group’s financial risk exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and
equity prices as well as the creditworthiness and the solvency of the Group’s counterparties.
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies reviewed by the boards of directors of Roche or
Chugai as appropriate to their areas of statutory responsibility. These policies cover credit risk, liquidity risk and market
risk. The policies provide guidance on risk limits, type of authorised financial instruments and monitoring procedures.
As a general principle, the policies prohibit the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.
Policy implementation and day-to-day risk management are carried out by the relevant treasury functions and regular
reporting on these risks is performed by the relevant accounting and controlling functions within Roche and Chugai.

125
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations, causing financial
losses for the Group. The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses of liquid funds deposited with
or invested in such counterparties.
The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering netting agreements and without
taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements, is equal to the carrying value of the Group’s financial
assets.
Trade receivables. These are subject to a policy of active credit risk management which focuses on the assessment
of country risk, credit availability, on-going credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures. The objective of the
management of trade receivables is to sustain the growth and profitability of the Group by optimising asset utilisation whilst
maintaining risks at an acceptable level. Except as noted below, there is no significant concentration of counterparty credit
risk due to the Group’s large number of customers and their wide geographical spread. Risk limits and exposures are
continuously monitored by country and by the nature of counterparties. Additionally, the Group obtains credit insurance
and similar enhancements when appropriate to protect the collection of trade receivables. As at 31 December 2012 no
collateral was held for loans and receivables (2011: none).
At 31 December 2012 the Group’s combined trade accounts receivable balance with three US national wholesale distributors,
AmerisourceBergen Corp., Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corp., was equivalent to 1.4 billion Swiss francs representing
14% of the Group’s consolidated trade accounts receivable (2011: 1.3 billion Swiss francs representing 13%).
At 31 December 2012 the Group has trade receivables of 10.1 billion Swiss francs. Since the beginning of 2010 there have
been increasing financial difficulties in Southern European countries, notably Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. The Group
is a leading supplier to the healthcare sectors in these countries and has trade receivables of 1.2 billion euros (1.5 billion
Swiss francs) with the public customers in these countries. This is a reduction of 0.5 billion euros from 31 December 2011,
which is mainly due to collections in Spain following the Montoro plan as well as increased factoring deals in Italy. The Group
uses different measures to improve collections in these countries, including intense communication with customers, factoring,
negotiations of payments plans, charging of interest for late payments, and legal action. The Group is also applying new
commercial arrangements with some public hospitals in Greece and Portugal.
The nature and geographic location of counterparties to trade receivables that are not overdue are shown in the table below.
These include the not overdue balances with US national wholesalers and Southern Europe public customers described
above.

Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsCash and marketable securities. These are subject to a policy of restricting exposures to high-quality counterparties
and setting defined limits for individual counterparties. These limits and counterparty credit ratings are reviewed regularly.
Investments in marketable securities are entered into on the basis of guidelines with regard to liquidity, quality and maximum
amount. As a general rule, the Group invests only in high-quality securities with adequate liquidity. Cash and short-term
time deposits are subject to rules which limit the Group’s exposure to individual financial institutions. Within its fixed income
marketable securities, the Group holds 3.8 billion Swiss francs of government securities, of which 47% are with Switzerland,
and all of which are with counterparties with a rating of ‘AA’ or better, with the exception of Argentina (7 million Swiss francs
as of 31 December 2012) which are rated ‘B–’.

Derivatives. The Group signs netting and collateral agreements under an ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives
Association) master agreement with the respective counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty risk on derivative
positions. During 2009 the Group entered into derivative contracts with third parties to hedge the foreign exchange risk
arising from bonds and notes issued by the Group’s US affiliate, Roche Holdings, Inc. in currencies other than US dollar.
A total of 0.2 billion Swiss francs cash collateral was delivered to the Group during the year (2011: 0.1 billion Swiss francs
delivered to the Group). The collateral agreements set out that only cash is acceptable as collateral. All collateral received
or delivered as at 31 December 2012 related to derivative activities.

As at 31 December 2012 there are no significant financial assets whose terms have been renegotiated (2011: none).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time.
The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity
requirements at any point in time. Group liquidity is reported to senior management on a monthly basis.
Roche and Chugai enjoy strong credit quality and are rated by at least one major credit rating agency. The ratings will
permit efficient access to the international capital markets in the event of major financing requirements. In addition, the
Group has unused committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling 5.1 billion Swiss francs (2011: 5.2 billion
Swiss francs). The decline in undiscounted financial liabilities, shown in the table below, is mainly due to debt repayments
and interest paid.

Market risk
Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities. Market risk may affect
the Group financial result and the value of Group equity.
The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to measure the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. Roche has defined
VaR limits to manage market risk. VaR data are reported on a monthly basis and indicate the value range within which a given
financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices. VaR is a statistical
measure which implicitly assumes that value changes of the recent past are indicative of value changes in the future. VaR
figures do not represent actual or expected losses, or possible worst-case losses over the stated period.
VaR figures are calculated using a historical simulation approach. For each scenario, all financial instruments are fully
valued and the total change in value and earnings is determined. All VaR calculations are based on a 95% confidence level
and a holding period of 20 trading days over the past ten years. This holding period reflects the time required to change
the corresponding risk exposure, should this be deemed appropriate. Longer holding periods increase the probability of
higher value changes and lead to increased VaR figures.
Actual future gains and losses associated with our treasury activities may differ materially from the VaR analyses performed
due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes to interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates and equity investment prices, particularly in periods of high market volatilities. Furthermore, the VaR
numbers below do not include the effect of changes in credit spreads.

VaR – Foreign exchange component 50 49
VaR – Other price component 31 35
Diversification (67) (69)
VaR – Total market risk 205 316
The interest rate VaR decreased to 191 million Swiss francs reflecting the ageing of debt and the repayment of debt during
2012. As all issued debt is held at amortised cost, the interest rate VaR is a sole metric for economic fair value changes, but
there is no impact on the carrying value or profit and loss of the Group. The foreign exchange VaR remained stable. Other
price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities and remained largely stable. At 31 December 2012
the Group held equity securities with a market value of 0.5 billion Swiss francs (31 December 2011: 0.4 billion Swiss francs).
This includes holdings in biotechnology companies, which were acquired in the context of licensing transactions or scientific
collaborations.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates across the world and is exposed to movements in foreign currencies affecting the Group financial
result and the value of Group’s equity. Foreign exchange risk arises because the amount of local currency paid or received
for transactions denominated in foreign currencies may vary due to changes in exchange rates (‘transaction exposures’)
and because the foreign currency denominated financial statements of the Group’s foreign subsidiaries may vary upon
consolidation into the Swiss franc-denominated Group Financial Statements (‘translation exposures’).
The objective of the Group’s foreign exchange risk management activities is to preserve the economic value of its current and
future assets and to minimise the volatility of the Group’s financial result. The primary focus of the Group’s foreign exchange
risk management activities is on hedging transaction exposures arising through foreign currency flows or monetary positions
held in foreign currencies.
The Group monitors transaction exposures on a daily basis. The net foreign exchange result and the corresponding VaR
parameters are reported on a monthly basis. The Group uses forward contracts, foreign exchange options and cross-
currency swaps to hedge transaction exposures. Application of these instruments intends to continuously lock in favourable
developments of foreign exchange rates, thereby reducing the exposure to potential future movements in such rates.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could affect the Group financial result or the value of Group
equity. Changes in interest rates may cause variations in interest income and expense. In addition, they may affect the
market value of certain financial assets, liabilities and hedging instruments. The primary objective of the Group’s interest rate
management is to protect the net interest result.
Interest rate exposures and the corresponding VaR parameters are reported on a monthly basis. The Group may use forward
contracts, options and swaps to hedge its interest rate exposures. Depending on the interest rate environment of major
currencies, the Group will use these instruments to generate the appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposures.
Other price risk
Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities. The Group manages the price risk through
placing limits on individual and total equity investments. These limits are defined both as a percentage of total liquid funds
and as an absolute number for individual equity investments. Equity price risk is reported as a VaR figure on a monthly basis
to senior management.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Impairment of financial assets
In 2012 and 2011 impairments of loans and receivables were mainly due to an increase in the expected non-recoverability of
trade receivables. The write-downs of debt securities of 16 million Swiss francs in 2011 relate to Greek government bonds
received in exchange for trade receivables.

Capital
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total capitalisation, being the sum of debt plus equity, including
non-controlling interests. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide benefits for patients
and returns to investors.
To provide an adequate return to investors based on the level of risk undertaken.
To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver future benefits
for patients and returns to investors.
To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The Group completed the purchase of the non-controlling interests in Genentech effective 26 March 2009 for a consideration,
net of tax effects, of approximately 52.2 billion Swiss francs. Based on the revised International Accounting Standard 27
‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ (IAS 27), which was adopted by the Group in 2008, this transaction was
accounted for in full as an equity transaction. As a consequence, the carrying amount of the consolidated equity of the
Group was reduced by 52.2 billion Swiss francs, of which 8.5 billion Swiss francs was allocated to eliminate the book value
of Genentech non-controlling interests. This accounting effect significantly impacts the Group’s net equity, but has no effect
on the Group’s business or its dividend policy.
Capital is monitored on the basis of the capitalisation, which is calculated as being debt plus equity (including non-controlling
interests). This is reported to senior management as part of the Group’s regular internal management reporting. The Group’s
capitalisation is shown in the table below.

The Group is not subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements as known in the financial services industry.
The Group has a majority shareholding in Chugai (see Note 3). Chugai is a public company and its objectives, policies and
processes for managing its own capital are determined by local management.

Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsReport of Roche Management on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
control over financial reporting. The internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance over the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems
determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2012
based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment,
management has concluded that the system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 31 December 2012.
The Statutory Auditor KPMG AG have audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year
ended 31 December 2012, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and with the International Standards on Auditing
(ISA). They have also issued a report on the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control over financial reporting.
This report is set out on pages 140 to 141.

Roche Group – Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting | Roche Finance Report 2012Report of the Statutory Auditor on
the Consolidated Financial Statements
Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Consolidated Financial Statements to the Annual General Meeting
of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
As statutory auditor, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, which
comprise the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, statement
of changes in equity and notes on pages 44 to 136 for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Board of Directors’ Responsibility. The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and
the requirements of Swiss law. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control
system relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying
appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s Responsibility. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, Swiss Auditing Standards and International Standards
on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks
of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of
the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 give a true and fair view
of the financial position, the results of operations and the cash flows in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), and comply with Swiss law.
138
Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Consolidated Financial StatementsReport on Other Legal Requirements
We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA) and independence
(article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence.
In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control
system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions
of the Board of Directors.
We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

Roche Group – Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2012Report of the Independent Auditor on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of the Independent Auditor on Internal Control over Financial Reporting to the Annual General Meeting
of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
We have examined the Roche Group’s system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2012, based
on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (COSO).
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as included in the
accompanying Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our examination. An entity’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process effected by the entity’s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial statements prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements
in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding the
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have
a material effect on the entity’s financial statements.
We conducted our examination in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000).
This standard requires that we plan and perform our examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our examination included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of management
override of controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation
of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that internal control may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Group – Report of the Independent Auditor on Internal Control over Financial ReportingIn our opinion, the Roche Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of 31 December 2012 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and International Standards on Auditing,
the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended 31 December 2012 and our report dated
28 January 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Roche Group – Multi-Year Overview and Supplementary Information | Roche Finance Report 2012Supplementary Core results and EPS information
The Group’s basic and diluted earnings per share information is given in Note 28 to the Annual Financial Statements on
pages 120 to 121. The Group has expanded the presentation of its core results in 2010. Previously only core EPS was shown,
but now the full income statement for the Group and the operating results of the divisions are shown on both an IFRS and
core basis. This allows a transparent assessment of both the actual results and the underlying performance of the business.
The core results concept, which is used in the internal management of the business, is based on the IFRS results, with the
following adjustments:
Global restructuring plans (see Note 7) are excluded.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (see Note 13) and impairment of goodwill (see Note 12) are excluded.
Acquisition accounting and other one-time impacts from Alliance arrangements and Business Combinations (see Financial
Review) are excluded.
Discontinued operations (currently none) would be excluded.
Legal and environmental expenses (see Financial Review) are excluded.
Global issues outside the healthcare sector beyond the Group’s control are excluded. In 2011 this includes the directly
attributable costs of the earthquake that occurred in Japan on 11 March 2011 (see Note 3). There were no such items in
2012.
Material one-time treasury items such as major debt restructurings or settlement of pension plans (both currently none)
would be excluded.
The tax benefit recorded under IFRS in respect of Equity Compensation Plans (ECPs), which varies according to price
of the underlying equity, is replaced by a normalised tax benefit, being the IFRS 2 expense multiplied by the applicable tax
rate (see Note 5).
The core results concept was further described on 22 October 2010 at an Investor Update teleconference, which is available
for download at: http://www.roche.com/investors/ir_agenda/csr_151010.htm
The Group’s IFRS results, including the divisional breakdown, are reconciled to the core results in the tables below.
The calculation of core EPS is also given in the tables below. Additional commentary to the adjustment items is given in
the Financial Review.

Bonus Stock Awards. Certain members of the Corporate Executive Committee will be granted Bonus Stock Awards in lieu
of part or all of their cash-settled bonus for the financial year 2012. These will be issued by the end of April 2013 with a total
fair value for the employee of 3,143 thousand Swiss francs. The fair value of these awards for the employee is calculated
taking into account the period in which they are blocked (3 years: 83.962%, 10 years: 55.839%). The number of awards and
fair value per award will be calculated at the grant date.
Employer contribution to social security schemes and pension plans. The Group pays social insurance contributions
in respect of the above remuneration and pays contributions to pension and other post-employment benefit plans for the
Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate Executive Committee.
Equity Compensation Plans. The Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate Executive Committee
also participate in certain equity compensation plans as described below. The terms and vesting conditions of these awards
are disclosed in Note 10 to the Roche Group Annual Financial Statements. The fair values used in the Roche Group Annual
Financial Statements represent the cost to the company at grant date and reflect amongst other matters the observed
exercise behaviour and exit rate for the whole population that receive the awards and initial simulations of any performance
conditions. For the purposes of these remuneration disclosures the values are calculated based on the fair value that the
employee receives taking into account the preliminary assessment of any completed performance conditions.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate Executive Committee are eligible to participate in
Roche Connect, a programme that enables employees to make regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting
equity securities. The Group contributes to the programme, which allows the employees to purchase non-voting equity
securities at a discount (usually 20%).
During 2012 members of the Corporate Executive Committee were granted 408,288 Stock-settled Stock Appreciation
Rights (S-SARs). The individual awards relating to 2012 are shown in the table below. The fair value of these awards for
the employees was 9,966 thousand Swiss francs, which was calculated using the Trinomial model for American options.
160
Roche Finance Report 2012 | Roche Holding Ltd, Basel – Notes to the Financial StatementsMembers of the Corporate Executive Committee and other members of senior management participate in the Roche
Performance Share Plan (PSP). The Group has three overlapping three-year PSPs. The target awards for the three-year cycle
are defined at the beginning of the cycle and the awards are considered to form part of the employee’s remuneration in three
equal annual amounts over the three-year cycle. Each award will result in between zero and two non-voting equity securities,
depending upon the achievement of the performance targets, and the discretion of the Board of Directors. The individual
awards relating to 2012 are shown in the table below. The number of the awards is calculated as follows:
PSP 2010–2012: At the end of the cycle the performance targets were not achieved and accordingly the participants
received none of the originally targeted non-voting equity securities.
PSP 2011–2013: One non-voting equity security per award.
PSP 2012–2014: One non-voting equity security per award.
The resulting allocations are multiplied by the non-voting equity security price at 31 December 2012 of 184 Swiss francs
to give the fair value for the remuneration received by the employee.

Roche Holding Ltd, Basel – Appropriation of Available Earnings | Roche Finance Report 2012Report of the Statutory Auditor
on the Financial Statements
Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Financial Statements to the Annual General Meeting
of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
As statutory auditor, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, which comprise
the income statement, balance sheet and notes on pages 155 to 165 for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Board of Directors’ Responsibility. The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements
in accordance with the requirements of Swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation. This responsibility includes
designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting
and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s Responsibility. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor
considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the entity’s internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion.
Opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 comply with Swiss law and the
company’s articles of incorporation.
166

of Directors.

of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

Finance – 2010 in brief Roche Finance Report 2010
Finance – 2010 in brief
Sales
• Group sales were 47.5 billion Swiss francs, a decline of 3% due to the large pandemic sales of Tamiflu
in the comparative period and a currency translation effect from the strength of the Swiss franc relative
to the US dollar and euro. Local currency sales were stable as growth in the underlying business
compensated for the sharply reduced Tamiflu sales. Excluding Tamiflu, Group sales increased by 5%
in local currencies.
• The Pharmaceuticals Division sales grew above the market at 5% in local currencies, excluding Tamiflu.
There was solid growth in key oncology products, Lucentis in ophthalmology and Actemra/RoActemra
in rheumatoid arthritis.
• Tamiflu sales in 2010 declined sharply by over 2.3 billion Swiss francs to 0.9 billion Swiss francs due
to the 2009 pandemic A (H1N1) influenza virus (‘swine flu’) outbreak.
• Healthcare reforms in the United States, austerity measures in Europe and price cuts in Japan had
a negative impact on Pharmaceuticals sales of almost 800 million Swiss francs and 2 percentage points
on sales growth.
• Diagnostics sales increased by 8% in local currencies to 10.4 billion Swiss francs, driven by sales growth
in Professional Diagnostics and Diabetes Care. This was significantly ahead of the estimated IVD market
growth rate.
Operating results
• Core operating profit increased by 7% in local currencies to 16.6 billion Swiss francs thanks to the
Genentech integration synergies and productivity improvements, which more than offset the substantially
lower profit contribution from Tamiflu and the impact of the healthcare reforms.
• The core operating profit margin increased by 1.7 percentage points, while the increase in the
Pharmaceuticals Division was 1.9 percentage points and in the Diagnostics Division 3.8 percentage points.
• Research and development expenditure on a core basis declined 2% in local currencies to 9.0 billion Swiss
francs, representing 19.1% of Group sales.
• On 17 November 2010 the Group announced the details of its Operational Excellence programme.
Initial restructuring charges of 1.3 billion Swiss francs were included in the 2010 IFRS operating results,
mainly relating to severance costs and asset impairments.
Treasury
• Core net financial expenses increased by 0.6 million Swiss francs primarily due to a full year of financing
costs in 2010 for the debt issued in the first quarter of 2009 in respect of the Genentech transaction,
and losses on early redemption of debt in 2010.
• The repayment of debt is ahead of schedule as 2.5 billion US dollars of debt was redeemed early
in September 2010. Of the 48.2 billion Swiss francs of bonds and notes issued in 2009 to finance
the Genentech transaction, 33% has already been repaid by the end of 2010, and a further 1.0 billion
US dollars has been called for early redemption in March 2011.
Financial condition
• Strong financial condition with an operating free cash flow of 14.1 billion Swiss francs and a free cash flow
of 4.7 billion Swiss francs.
• Net debt position of 19.2 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2010, down 4.7 billion from 23.9 billion Swiss
francs at the previous year-end.
• Strong credit rating: Moody’s at A2 and Standard & Poor’s at AA–.
Net income and Core EPS
• Net income increased by 4% to 8.9 billion Swiss francs compared to 2009 primarily driven by the strong
operating result.
• The Genentech transaction had an accretive impact on net income attributable to Roche shareholders,
which rose 11% to 8.7 billion Swiss francs. The synergies and the elimination of non-controlling interests
more than compensated for the costs of financing the transaction.
• Core EPS was 10% higher at constant exchange rates and 4% higher in Swiss francs.
Shareholder return
• Increase in proposed dividend of 10% to 6.60 Swiss francs, representing the 24th consecutive year
of dividend growth.
• If approved by shareholders, this will result in an increased payout ratio of 51.6% and a higher dividend
yield on Roche shares of 4.6% and on non-voting equity securities of 4.8%, based on year-end prices.
• Decline in Total Shareholder Return (TSR), i.e. share price movement plus dividends, of –19% combined
performance of share and non-voting equity security.4

In 2010 the Group achieved another solid operating performance. Sales were stable in local currencies
(–3% in Swiss francs; +1% in US dollars) at 47.5 billion Swiss francs as underlying growth was able to
compensate for the expected decline in Tamiflu sales and the initial impacts of healthcare reforms and
austerity measures. Excluding Tamiflu, sales increased by 5% in local currencies. The Pharmaceuticals
Division represented 78% of Group sales and the Diagnostics Division contributed 22%.
Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division declined by 2% in local currencies to 37.1 billion Swiss francs. Excluding
Tamiflu, local growth was 5%, above market growth. Demand for the oncology drugs Avastin, MabThera/
Rituxan, Herceptin, Xeloda and Tarceva continued to grow strongly. Additional major growth drivers were
Lucentis in ophthalmology, Actemra/RoActemra in rheumatoid arthritis and Mircera in renal anemia. These
positive factors mostly offset the expected decline in Tamiflu sales, the reduction in CellCept sales due to US
patent expiry in May 2009 and the impacts of the US healthcare reforms, European austerity measures and
price cuts in Japan. The Diagnostics Division increased sales to 10.4 billion Swiss francs, growing 8% in local
currencies (4% in Swiss francs; 8% in US dollars), thereby strengthening its leading market position. Major
growth areas were Professional Diagnostics and Diabetes Care.
The Group has expanded the presentation of its core results for 2010. Previously only Core EPS was shown,
but now the full income statement for the Group and the operating results of the divisions are shown on both
an IFRS and core basis. This allows a transparent assessment of both the actual results and the underlying
performance of the business. The core concept is fully described on pages 144–147 and reconciliations
between the IFRS and core results are given there.5
On a core basis, the Group’s operating profit increased by 7% in local currencies (2% in Swiss francs),
while sales were stable. The increase in profitability was driven by synergies from the Genentech integration,
further productivity improvements and cost containment. This performance was achieved in spite of a
substantially lower contribution from Tamiflu and the impacts of the healthcare reforms. Marketing and
distribution costs remained at around the prior year’s level in local currencies and research and development
costs declined. The Pharmaceuticals Division increased its core operating profit by 4% in local currencies,
driven primarily by cost synergies from the Genentech integration, resource prioritisation and productivity
improvements. Core operating profit growth in the Diagnostics Division was 30% in local currencies,
mainly resulting from sales growth and the ongoing operational efficiency programmes. The Group’s core
operating profit margin increased by 1.7 percentage points, with the Pharmaceuticals Division improving
by 1.9 percentage points and the Diagnostics Division by 3.8 percentage points. The margin increase at
Group level was lower than in the two divisions due to a mix effect, with a much stronger growth in the
relatively lower-margin Diagnostics business, and due to a shift of certain administration activities from the
Pharmaceuticals Division to Corporate as a result of the new Group organisation effective 1 January 2010.
The Group’s operating free cash flow remained strongly positive at over 14.1 billion Swiss francs. There was
a decrease of 6% in local currencies (10% in Swiss francs), principally arising from payments in early 2010 of
certain large year-end 2009 accrued liabilities, notably for Tamiflu royalties and employee retention/severance
schemes. The free cash flow in 2010 decreased by 4.2 billion Swiss francs to 4.7 billion Swiss francs. This was
primarily due to the non-recurrence of the one-time tax benefit in 2009 of 1.1 billion Swiss francs following
the Genentech transaction, the interest payments on the new debt issued to fund the Genentech transaction
which had no comparable payments in 2009, and higher dividend payments. The Group continued to pay
down the debt issued in the first half of 2009 to finance the Genentech transaction.
On 17 November 2010 the Group announced the details of the Operational Excellence programme. As a
consequence of implementing the respective restructuring measures, significant costs were incurred in
2010. The costs recognised in 2010 of 1.3 billion Swiss francs mainly relate to severance payments following
reductions in positions in sales and marketing, global manufacturing, global development and research and
early development, as well as impairments of intangible assets. The Pharmaceuticals Division accounts for
1.2 billion Swiss francs of these costs and 0.1 billion Swiss francs relate to the Diagnostics Division. Roughly
40% of the charges are non-cash, being mostly impairments of property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets.
During 2010 the Pharmaceuticals Division completed the integration and restructuring activities at
Genentech. Further expenses of 596 million Swiss francs were incurred in 2010, mainly due to site closure
and employee-related costs. In the comparative period 2,415 million Swiss francs were incurred mainly for
impairment of manufacturing facilities.

Pharmaceuticals operating results
Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division declined by 2% in local currencies to 37.1 billion Swiss francs. Excluding
Tamiflu, local growth was 5%, above market growth. Core operating profit grew 4% in local currencies and
was stable in Swiss francs at 14.8 billion Swiss francs. The core operating profit margin increased by
1.9 percentage points, driven by the Genentech integration synergies, resource prioritisation and productivity
improvements. This was achieved in spite of the expected sharp decline in Tamiflu sales of more than
2.3 billion Swiss francs and the impact of healthcare reforms and austerity measures. Exchange rate movements
had a negative 0.3 percentage point effect on the margin.
Marketing efforts focused on the growing oncology and rheumatoid arthritis portfolios, especially for
the broader indications of Avastin and Herceptin, and the launch of Actemra/RoActemra. Marketing and
distribution costs in local currencies decreased by 1% through tight cost management, which more than
covered an increase in allowances for bad debts in Southern Europe. Research and development costs
were reduced by 2% at constant exchange rates whereas in previous years they had increased significantly.
This was achieved by resource prioritisation while securing long-term growth through the rich pipeline.
The Pharmaceuticals Division acquired the US biopharmaceutical company Marcadia Biotech, whose research
programmes focus on new peptide therapies for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and obesity.
In 2010, the Pharmaceuticals Division incurred non-core expenses of 1.2 billion Swiss francs relating to the
Operational Excellence programme. Of this 0.8 billion Swiss francs relate to termination and other costs which
are shown as global restructuring costs in the reconciliations to the core results. The remaining 0.4 billion
Swiss francs consists of impairments of intangible assets. Also included in global restructuring costs are the
remaining costs of 0.6 billion Swiss francs from the Genentech integration and restructuring.7

Sales
Sales by therapeutic area | The major growth drivers were key products in the oncology, ophthalmology
and inflammation/autoimmune/transplantation therapeutic areas. In virology, sales of Tamiflu decreased
substantially due to unusually high sales in 2009 arising from the A (H1N1) influenza virus (‘swine flu’). Sales
in inflammation/autoimmune/transplantation increased slightly due to the continued success of MabThera/
Rituxan in rheumatoid arthritis as well as the excellent uptake of Actemra/RoActemra, which more than
compensated the negative impact from the CellCept patent expiry in the United States in May 2009. Sales in
the renal anemia therapeutic area decreased in an increasingly competitive, cost-sensitive market.

Sales by product | In 2010 the Top 20 Pharmaceuticals products, which represented 88% of sales of
the Pharmaceuticals portfolio, declined by 1% in local currencies as the growth contribution of the majority
of products could not entirely offset the expected significant decline of Tamiflu sales by more than 2.3 billion
Swiss francs. Local sales growth of the Pharmaceuticals Division was primarily driven by six products:
Avastin, MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin, Lucentis, Actemra/RoActemra and Xeloda. These products represent
58% of the portfolio (2009: 52%; 2008: 51%) and together generated 1.3 billion Swiss francs of additional
sales in 2010 compared to 2009. Sales of other products declined, as the contribution to sales growth from
the renal anemia medication Mircera could not fully offset the lower sales of some other products due to
generic erosion following patent expiry and the voluntary withdrawal of Raptiva from the US market in 2009.8

1) Inflammation/Autoimmune/Transplantation.
Avastin | Sales for advanced colorectal, breast, lung and kidney cancer, and for relapsed glioblastoma
(a type of brain tumour) rose 9% in local currencies to 6.5 billion Swiss francs, reflecting the continued
positive uptake of the product overall. Sales growth of 7% in Western Europe is being driven primarily by
continued uptake for breast cancer and improved uptake for lung cancer. US sales were stable overall, with
lower sales in the second half reflecting regulatory and reimbursement uncertainty regarding the metastatic
breast cancer indication. Very strong sales growth in Japan of 51% was driven by good uptake in colorectal
cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Significant sales growth was also recorded in Latin America. Following
marketing approval in China earlier this year, Avastin was launched for the first-line treatment of metastatic
colorectal cancer in the third quarter and contributed to a sharp growth of 49% in sales in Asia.
MabThera/Rituxan | Full-year sales in oncology and autoimmune disease areas for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
(NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) totalled 6.4 billion Swiss francs
in 2010, an increase of 9% in local currencies versus 2009. Sustained growth in the oncology segment was
driven by uptake in CLL and continued strong use in NHL in Western Europe and the US. The high growth
of 20% in the International region, including increases in key emerging markets, reflects uptake of the
medicine in its NHL indications. The European rollout of MabThera in a new indication, first-line maintenance
treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma, began in the fourth quarter. Estimated sales in the RA segment
reached the 1.0 billion Swiss franc mark in 2010. Growth is being driven by increased use in patients with
an inadequate response to one or more tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and by growing acceptance of six-
month repeat treatment intervals.9
Herceptin | Global sales for HER2-positive breast cancer and advanced HER2-positive stomach cancer rose
7% in local currencies to 5.4 billion Swiss francs due to sustained growth of 6% in both the United States
and Western Europe and significant increase of 18% in the International region. Herceptin maintained its
solid market penetration in breast cancer, with sales also benefiting from initial uptake for stomach cancer in
EU countries and other markets. In addition improvements in the quality of HER2 testing are expanding the
population of patients eligible for treatment with Herceptin. A higher sales volume in Japan was outweighed
by the effect of revised reimbursement prices from April 2010, resulting in a significant decline in sales of
15% compared with 2009.
Pegasys | Sales for hepatitis B and C remained virtually stable year-on-year at 1.6 billion Swiss francs, with
growth seen in the Asia region. Sales decreases of 4% in Western Europe and 6% in Japan were offset by
growth of 9% in the International region, especially Asia and CEMAI countries. The product’s market share
continued to expand in the main European markets, the US and Japan. Global sales continued to benefit from
clinical data reinforcing the superiority of Pegasys over other hepatitis C treatment options and increased
use in the treatment of hepatitis B.
Lucentis | US sales for wet age-related macular degeneration and macular edema following retinal vein
occlusion grew 27% in local currencies to 1.5 billion Swiss francs. The strong growth throughout the year has
been driven primarily by an increase in the total number of patients receiving Lucentis and the time patients
are on treatment. The US launch of Lucentis for the treatment of macular edema (swelling in the retina)
following retinal vein occlusion began in late June 2010 and the initial uptake is encouraging.
Xeloda | Sales for colorectal, stomach and breast cancer rose 17% in local currencies to 1.4 billion Swiss
francs. Growth was driven primarily by significant increases in the United States, Japan and China, the
product’s three largest markets. Global sales of Xeloda are benefitting from a number of new indications,
including stomach cancer in China, an expanded metastatic colorectal cancer indication in Japan, and
adjuvant colon cancer in Europe, as well as increased patient share in metastatic breast cancer in the EU.
Tarceva | Sales for advanced lung and pancreatic cancer grew 6% in local currencies to 1.3 billion Swiss
francs, driven mainly by increased use in the second-line non-small cell lung cancer setting. The main growth
contributions came from the International region with 16% growth, and also from Japan and the United
States. Growth of 5% in the US reflects steady demand in the lung and pancreatic cancer indications and the
impact of government healthcare reforms. Against a background of stable demand, sales in Western Europe
declined slightly mainly as a result of government-mandated pharmaceutical price reductions and rebates
in several major markets. Sustained sales growth of 37% in Japan reflects continued market penetration and
oncologists’ increasing confidence in the benefits of treatment with Tarceva.
CellCept | At 1.3 billion Swiss francs, sales of CellCept for the prevention of solid organ transplant rejection
remained significant. The sales decrease of 15% in local currencies was due to the loss of patent exclusivity
in the United States in May 2009. The resulting losses to competition from generic versions caused US sales
to decrease by 48%. This was partly offset by sales growth in the International region of 5% and in Japan
of 16%.
NeoRecormon/Epogin | Combined sales of Roche’s NeoRecormon and Chugai’s Epogin (epoetin beta)
declined 15% in local currencies to 1.3 billion Swiss francs. Roche’s overall share of the European anemia
market remained stable, despite increasing biosimilars competition, due mainly to the strong performance
of Mircera in the major EU countries and a robust market share by volume for NeoRecormon in the renal
indication. A decline in sales of Epogin in Japan of 10% was mainly due to competition in the dialysis market
and a lower National Health Insurance reimbursement price. These effects outweighed the increased
demand for the medicine in the pre-dialysis segment.10
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Financial Review
Tamiflu | Following unprecedented demand in 2009 due to the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic sales of Tamiflu,
for influenza A and B, totalled 0.9 billion Swiss francs in 2010, a decrease of 2.3 billion Swiss francs, or 73%
lower than in 2009. With government stockpiling orders largely completed by early 2010 and the influenza
A (H1N1) pandemic passing its peak, sales fell sharply in the last three quarters of 2010. Sales were also
affected by relatively mild influenza seasons in both hemispheres during 2010.
Actemra/RoActemra | As the global rollout of the novel rheumatoid arthritis medicine Actemra continued,
sales in 2010 totalled 397 million Swiss francs, a rise of 177% in local currencies over 2009. Uptake of
Actemra/RoActemra in the EU, the United States and other launch markets remains very encouraging.
Continued strong sales growth of 67% in Japan reflects increasing use of Actemra as a first-line biologic.
Mircera | Sales of the renal anemia medication Mircera rose 51% in local currencies to 255 million Swiss
francs. Demand for Mircera, which is now available in over 100 countries worldwide, is coming mainly from
the pre-dialysis segment and new patient commencements.
See the Business Report (Part 1 of this Annual Report) for more information on Roche’s pharmaceutical
products.
Sales by region | The worldwide pandemic A (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus (‘swine flu’) outbreak that
began in the first half of 2009 and other pandemic sales resulted in unusually high sales for Tamiflu in
the comparative period. The significant decline in demand since December 2009 led to varying impacts
across regions which are shown in the table below. Therefore the following comments focus on the
business excluding Tamiflu. In the United States sales continued to grow by 4% in local currencies driven
by the oncology products and Lucentis. This more than covered the substantial decline in CellCept post-
patent expiry, which was down by 48% in US dollars, with a negative impact on regional sales growth
of 2 percentage points. In addition the initial impact of the US healthcare reforms led to a reduction of sales
of approximately 250 million US dollars (260 million Swiss francs) in 2010 through increased rebates, affecting
all major products. Sales in Western Europe increased by 2% due to the strong oncology portfolio and good
uptake of Actemra/RoActemra and Mircera and in spite of an estimated 275 million Swiss francs negative
impact from European austerity measures. CEMAI (Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa, Central
Asia and Indian subcontinent), Latin America and Asia–Pacific regions showed strong growth driven by
MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin, Avastin, Xeloda, Pegasys and Mircera. Sales in Japan increased by 3% as the
continued success of Avastin, Actemra/RoActemra, Xeloda, Tarceva and MabThera outweighed the impact
from biennial price cuts in Japan, which became effective 1 April 2010.

Operating results
Royalties and other operating income | The decline of 18% in local currencies was in particular due to
369 million Swiss francs lower income from out-licensing agreements in 2010. This decrease was mainly
due to the non-recurrence of significant milestone payments in 2009 from GlaxoSmithKline (84 million
Swiss francs related to orlistat OTC approval by the EU and 81 million Swiss francs for Bonviva/Boniva) and
milestone income at Chugai in 2009. Furthermore the comparative period included income from the disposal
of products, mainly in Latin America, of 226 million Swiss francs compared to 120 million Swiss francs in 2010.
These effects were only partly offset in 2010 by higher royalty income. In total royalties and other operating
income as a percentage of sales decreased by 0.8 percentage points to 4.2% (2009: 5.0%).

Cost of sales | On a core basis, costs decreased by 12% in local currencies as a result of lower royalty
expenses, reductions in manufacturing costs and lower costs from collaboration agreements. As a percentage
of sales, cost of sales declined to 21.4% (2009: 23.9%). The 6% decline in manufacturing cost of goods
sold and period costs was mainly due to productivity improvements and favourable product mix effects. The
comparative period includes the one-time impact of the inventory write-off of 141 million Swiss francs for the
voluntary withdrawal of Raptiva from the US market in 2009. Royalty expenses were 23% lower mainly due
to lower sales of Tamiflu and CellCept in 2010. This was partly offset by higher royalties on Bonviva/Boniva of
176 million Swiss francs as a result of a contractual change with GlaxoSmithKline. Expenses for collaboration
and profit-sharing agreements decreased by 13%. This reduction was primarily as a result of the same
amended agreement with GlaxoSmithKline for Bonviva/Boniva, with expenses of 121 million Swiss francs in
2010 compared to 407 million Swiss francs in 2009. Expenses from collaboration agreements with Biogen
Idec, Novartis and OSI in the US increased to 1,430 million Swiss francs (2009: 1,417 million Swiss francs).
Project termination costs in the manufacturing and logistics area of 66 million Swiss francs were recorded
as part of the Operational Excellence programme. The amortisation charge on marketed products in use was
28% lower in local currencies as certain acquisition intangibles were fully amortised by the end of 2009.

Marketing and distribution | Core costs declined by 1% in local currencies to 6.7 billion Swiss francs
and as a percentage of sales remained practically stable at 18.0% (2009: 17.9%). Sales and marketing
efforts focussed on the oncology portfolio with the rollout of additional approved indications of Avastin and
Herceptin, continued rollouts and support of Actemra/RoActemra in rheumatoid arthritis, Bonviva/Boniva and
Pegasys. There was also increased focus on emerging markets. Bad debt provisions increased significantly
taking into account the financial crisis, particularly in Southern Europe. These higher costs were compensated
by generally lower product promotion and field force expenses. Termination costs in commercial operations
of 312 million Swiss francs were recorded as part of the Operational Excellence programme.

Research and development | The increase of research and development costs seen in previous years
was halted. Core research and development expenses declined by 2% in local currencies due to resource
prioritisation, while securing long-term growth through the promising pipeline. Research and development
costs as a percentage of sales were 22.0%, same as in 2009. The main focus areas were the metabolism
franchise, some new phase III initiations requiring smaller studies and investments in the earlier-stage
neurology portfolio, which were offset by lower life cycle investments in oncology and inflammation. Research
and development expenses also included the immediate recognition of the remaining costs of 77 million
Swiss francs necessary to cover the termination of the ocrelizumab rheumatoid arthritis development
programme and the payment received from Novartis for opting in to the Lucentis study on the treatment of
macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. The majority of the costs of 701 million Swiss francs that
were recorded as part of the Operational Excellence programme relate to impairments of intangible assets
due to project terminations (424 million Swiss francs) and to termination costs in research and development
(277 million Swiss francs). The remaining impairment charges of 210 million Swiss francs include 180 million
Swiss francs with respect to product intangibles not available for use primarily due to recent clinical data.

General and administration | Overall, core costs decreased by 14% in local currencies, driven by
lower administration costs and an organisational shift effective from 1 January 2010 of certain finance,
IT and communication functions to Corporate. In 2009 administration costs of 78 million Swiss francs
(0.2 percentage points of sales) for these functions were included in the results of the Pharmaceuticals
Division. The remaining reduction in administration costs was mainly due to synergies following the
Genentech integration. The non-core costs in the general and administration area included costs of
113 million Swiss francs relating to Operational Excellence, which consists mainly of employee termination
costs. Effective 26 March 2009 the Group obtained full ownership of Genentech and further continued the
implementation of the reorganisation of the Group’s US Pharmaceuticals business announced on 21 July
2008. Subsequently, the Group commenced a restructuring of its Pharmaceuticals manufacturing operations,
particularly in the biotech network. During 2010 further expenses of 596 million Swiss francs were incurred
mainly due to site closure and employee-related costs. In the comparative period 2,415 million Swiss francs
were incurred mainly for impairment of manufacturing facilities. Additional information is given in Note 8
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The total cost of the integration and restructuring was 3.3 billion
Swiss francs, which includes 2.7 billion Swiss francs that were incurred in years 2008 and 2009. Of this total
of 3.3 billion Swiss francs approximately 2.0 billion Swiss francs were non-cash. Legal and environmental
settlement costs were 301 million Swiss francs, a decrease of 115 million Swiss francs compared to 2009.
These costs represent the current development of the various litigation and other issues. Additional
information is given in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating free cash flow
The Pharmaceuticals Division generated a strong operating free cash flow of 12.9 billion Swiss francs. As
a percentage of sales the division’s operating free cash flow decreased to 34.9% compared to 38.3% in 2009.
The decrease of 9% in local currencies compared to 2009 is driven by the increase in net working capital of
0.8 billion Swiss francs which was mainly due to the payment in 2010 of some large 2009 year-end accruals.
This included the payment of the employee retention/severance schemes and high royalty payments relating
to the large Tamiflu sales in the second half of 2009. Third-party receivables remained at the end of 2010
at a similar level as in 2009 despite higher Days-Sales-Outstanding levels, particularly in Southern Europe.
Operating profit cash adjustments decreased mainly due to the 1.1 billion Swiss francs impairments of
property, plant and equipment following the Genentech transaction in the comparative period.14

Diagnostics operating results
The Diagnostics Division increased sales to 10.4 billion Swiss francs in 2010, growing 8% in local currencies
(4% in Swiss francs; 8% in US dollars), thereby strengthening its leading market position. Core operating
profit increased by 30% in local currencies and by 26% in Swiss francs to 2.2 billion Swiss francs. The core
operating profit margin increased by 3.8 percentage points to 21.1% of sales. This was driven by the high
sales growth with further positive effects from a more favourable product mix, manufacturing efficiency gains
and tight management of operating expenses. Exchange rate movements had a positive 0.2 percentage
point effect on the margin.
Global restructuring expenses of 144 million Swiss francs were recorded for Operational Excellence. The
development and manufacturing activities relating to blood gas diagnostics will be transferred to Rotkreuz
in Switzerland where the division’s Professional Diagnostics business area has its global headquarters.
The site at Graz in Austria will be closed. Research and development of insulin pumps will be transferred
from Burgdorf in Switzerland to Mannheim in Germany, Diabetes Care’s global headquarters. In addition
manufacturing of new pumps will be outsourced and the Burgdorf site closed thereafter. Diagnostics
chemical raw materials manufacturing and analytical services in Germany will be discontinued at Mannheim
and transferred to other sites.15
The Diagnostics Division acquired micropump specialist Medingo, thereby broadening the portfolio
of innovative insulin delivery technologies and strengthening its position in the Diabetes Care business.
The Tissue Diagnostics business area completed the acquisition of the US company BioImagene, which
will complement and strengthen the offering in image analysis and information management.
For more information on the divisional business and its pipeline, see the Business Report (Part 1 of this
Annual Report).

Sales
The Diagnostics business continued to increase sales significantly above the IVD market with a growth of 8%
in local currencies over 2009. Professional Diagnostics with 11% sales growth, leveraged by Immuno-
diagnostics, and Diabetes Care with 4% sales growth were the main growth contributors, with both business
areas growing above their respective markets. Sales in Molecular Diagnostics totalled 1,189 million Swiss
francs, an increase of 4%, led by the virology segment. Applied Science sales grew by 4% in local currencies
driven by the cell analysis, genomics and custom biotech segments. Sales of Tissue Diagnostics totalled
541 million Swiss francs driven by sales in the advanced tissue staining market.

Professional Diagnostics | Sales rose 11% in local currencies, about twice the market rate, to 4,858 million
Swiss francs. The immunoassay business grew 17%, gaining additional market share due to new placements
of cobas analysers combined with strong assay sales from an expanding test menu. Other key drivers were
clinical chemistry with 5% growth, and point-of-care solutions with 10% growth. Professional Diagnostics
launched eight new or next-generation immunoassays, including six tests to diagnose or monitor infectious
diseases. Following FDA approval in September 2010 the rollout of the cobas 8000 series’ clinical chemistry
modules cobas c 701 and cobas c 502 commenced in the US. In July 2010 the new cobas 8000 immunoassay
module e 602 was launched in Europe and countries recognising the CE Mark, and in October 2010 in the
US. This module further improves testing efficiency by enabling large-volume laboratories to fully consolidate
their immunoassay and clinical chemistry testing.16
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Financial Review
Diabetes Care | Combined sales of blood glucose monitoring systems and insulin pumps outpaced their
market, rising 4% in local currencies to 2,959 million Swiss francs. The main growth drivers were Accu-Chek
Aviva/Accu-Chek Performa blood glucose monitoring systems, supported by continued market uptake of the
Accu-Chek Aviva Nano/Accu-Chek Performa Nano meters and the strip-free Accu-Chek Mobile system. In
the EU maltose-independent test strip chemistries received regulatory approval in June and were immediately
rolled out. US and Japanese regulatory approvals for maltose-free test strip chemistries are expected in 2011,
and will enable the latest additions to the Accu-Chek portfolio to be launched in these key markets. The
insulin delivery business posted robust sales growth, primarily due to Accu-Chek Combo, a combined insulin
pump and blood glucose monitoring system. In May 2010 Diabetes Care acquired Medingo, enhancing its
portfolio with an innovative micropump to strengthen its offering in insulin delivery.
Molecular Diagnostics | Sales in local currencies increased by 4% to 1,189 million Swiss francs, with
the main contribution from virology in Eastern Europe, North America and Asia–Pacific. Demand continued
for the fully automated cobas 4800 system for mid- to high-throughput laboratories. The FDA approved
LightCycler MRSA Advanced Test and dual PCR-target HIV Tests were successfully launched in the US.
Molecular Diagnostics received CE mark certification for the cobas TaqScreen DPX Test, the first duplex test
enabling simultaneous real-time detection of both parvovirus B19 and hepatitis A virus for increased safety
of human plasma and plasma products. Data from the ATHENA trial assessing the utility of the cobas 4800 HPV
Test in screening for cervical cancer were presented at the International Papillomavirus Conference in July
2010. The data confirmed the increased accuracy of HPV DNA testing, including 16/18 genotyping and was
used to file the test with the FDA in June 2010.
Applied Science | Sales rose 4% in local currencies to 868 million Swiss francs, driven by strong growth
in the cell analysis, genomics and custom biotech segments. Sales of MagNA Pure and LightCycler product
lines for sample preparation and quantitative PCR analysis declined due to dramatically lower demand for
influenza A (H1N1) virus testing. Cell analysis was driven by full integration of the innovatis product portfolio
and continued demand for the xCELLigence Systems, including the recently launched RTCA HT Instrument
for high-throughput analysis and RTCA Cardio Instrument for label-free cardiotoxicity testing. In genomics
up-take of the medium-throughput benchtop GS Junior DNA sequencer was strong, enabling next-generation
sequencing to thousands of research labs worldwide. Applied Science entered a partnership with IBM to
develop third-generation sequencing through nanopore-based single-molecule sequencing.
Tissue Diagnostics | Sales totalled 541 million Swiss francs, up 17% in local currencies, outperforming the
market in most key regions. Advanced tissue staining – immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridisation
(ISH) – continued to be the main growth driver, reflecting strong reagent sales along with continued robust
uptake of the BenchMark ULTRA system for simultaneous IHC and ISH testing on a single platform. Tissue
Diagnostics further expanded its advanced staining portfolio by launching 15 new antibodies to support
the diagnosis of various cancers. In September 2010 the label of HER2 SISH DNA Probe was extended in
Europe and other countries recognising the CE Mark to include use in assessing the likelihood of response
to treatment with Herceptin in both breast and gastric cancer. Tissue Diagnostics completed the acquisition
of BioImagene, a leader in digital pathology analysis and workflow, with products enabling high resolution
of whole-slide digital images from glass microscope slides.
See the Business Report (Part 1 of this Annual Report) for more information on Roche’s diagnostics products
and business areas.17
Sales by regions | Sales again outgrew the market in all regions. Asia–Pacific countries, led by China and
South Korea, achieved especially strong growth of 20%, driven mainly by Professional Diagnostics. Despite
pricing challenges sales growth of 6% outperformed the market in EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) in
both mature and emerging economies. This was driven by the strong performance of Professional Diagnostics
and Diabetes Care business areas. Professional Diagnostics and Tissue Diagnostics were the primary growth
drivers in North America with 5% growth. In Japan the good performance of Professional Diagnostics offset
continuing challenges in Diabetes Care and the overall divisional sales grew ahead of the market. Increased
investments in these regions as well as high demand for immunoassays and other leading-edge Roche
products contributed to the robust above-market growth in the E7 (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Korea,
Mexico and Turkey) emerging markets of 21%, with sales accounting for 13% of total divisional sales.

Operating results
Royalties and other operating income | Income of 157 million Swiss francs was 7% higher in local
currencies compared to 2009 due to local currency increases in out-licensing income of 25% as a result
of new PCR license contracts. There was also a 3% increase in royalty income.

Cost of sales | Core cost of sales increased by 4% in local currencies. The growth was under proportional
to sales growth resulting in a lower cost of sales ratio of 43.8% in 2010 compared to 45.5% in 2009. Various
cost reduction initiatives such as centralisation of logistics services, harmonisation of technical services
practices and renegotiations of supplier contracts had a positive impact. These more than compensated for
the higher depreciation and installation costs from the continued investments to expand market share
through meter placements and further increase in the installed instrument base. As part of the Operational
Excellence programme costs of 91 million Swiss francs were incurred relating to the manufacturing facilities
at Graz in Austria, Rotkreuz and Burgdorf in Switzerland and Mannheim in Germany. Total cost of sales
therefore increased by 5% in 2010 when compared to 2009.18

Operating free cash flow
The operating free cash flow of the Diagnostics Division of 1,634 million Swiss francs increased 48% in
local currencies compared to 2009, as the strong increase in the operating profit was only partially offset by
increases in net working capital. The increase in net working capital of 405 million Swiss francs was primarily
due to increases in accounts receivable especially in certain European countries such as Greece, and higher
inventory levels resulting from the launch of key products. As a percentage of sales, operating free cash flow
of the Diagnostics Division increased to 15.7% compared to 11.5% in 2009.

Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Financial Review
Corporate operating costs
General and administration | On a core basis, costs were 27% higher in local currencies at 387 million
Swiss francs (306 million Swiss francs in 2009) mainly due to the new Group organisation effective 1 January
2010. Since the beginning of 2010, administration costs include certain finance, IT and communication
functions which were previously part of the Pharmaceuticals Division. In 2009 these costs were 78 million
Swiss francs. Operating free cash flow was a net outflow of 418 million Swiss francs (2009: net outflow of
353 million Swiss francs) driven by the higher operating expenses. Total costs on an IFRS basis grew at 16%
in local currencies to 394 million Swiss francs (340 million Swiss francs in 2009) at a lower rate than core
costs, as the 2010 Operational Excellence restructuring expenses of 7 million Swiss francs were significantly
lower compared to last year’s increase in environmental provisions.

In 2010 the average rates for the euro, the US dollar and many other currencies were lower against the Swiss
franc compared to 2009, while the yen and some other currencies strengthened against the Swiss franc.
For sales these developments resulted in a growth being 3 percentage points lower in Swiss franc terms
compared to the local currency basis. Core operating profit growth expressed in Swiss francs was
5 percentage point lower than in local currencies. This slightly higher impact is due to a different currency
structure of operating costs than of sales.21

Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Financial Review
The 2010 results include a full twelve months of interest expenses for the new debt issued in 2009 to finance
the Genentech transaction, compared to only nine months in 2009. The increase from the full-year effect was
partly offset by lower interest expenses due to repayment of some of the bonds and notes. In 2010 there was
also 255 million Swiss francs recorded as a loss on early redemption of debt. In 2010 financing costs therefore
increased by 369 million Swiss francs, or 15%, to 2,829 million Swiss francs, exceeding financial income by
2,272 million Swiss francs. In addition the comparative period in 2009 included non-core financing costs of
377 million Swiss francs directly attributable to the Genentech transaction. The Group’s effective tax rate on
a core basis decreased slightly to 21.9% compared to 22.5% in 2009. Net income increased by 4% driven
by a strong operating performance in spite of significantly lower Tamiflu sales and by overall lower non-core
items such as global restructuring charges and amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, although
significant charges were already incurred in respect of the Operational Excellence initiative. On a core basis,
net income decreased slightly. The core net income attributable to Roche shareholders was 3% higher
compared to 2009 due to the further improving operating performance and elimination of non-controlling
interests more than compensating for the higher financing costs arising from the Genentech transaction.

Financial income
Financial income was 557 million Swiss francs in 2010, declining 30% compared to 2009. Interest income
and income from debt securities were 64 million Swiss francs, down 71% due to decreases in interest rates
on reduced debt security holdings. The net foreign exchange result was a loss of 147 million Swiss francs
compared to a gain of 33 million Swiss francs in 2009, with the decline being mainly due to the currency
devaluation in Venezuela. Net income from equity securities was 94 million Swiss francs compared to 36
million Swiss francs in 2009. Expected returns on pension plan assets were 562 million Swiss francs, up 11%
compared to 2009, due to increases in value of the pension plan assets.
In order to execute the Genentech transaction in 2009, the Group liquidated certain debt securities into cash.
This resulted in a non-core net loss of 238 million Swiss francs, which were included in the IFRS financial
income in 2009.
A full analysis of financial income is given in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.23
Financing costs
Financing costs were 2,829 million Swiss francs, an increase of 369 million Swiss francs or 15% compared
to 2009. The increase is mainly due to 255 million Swiss francs for the loss on early redemption of debt as
the Group has redeemed on 9 September 2010 all 2.5 billion US dollars of notes that were due 1 March 2012
and exercised its option to call for redemption 1.0 billion US dollars of notes that were due 1 March 2014.
Interest expenses were 1,849 million Swiss francs, an increase of 116 million Swiss francs or 7%, reflecting
twelve months of financing costs in 2010 compared to only nine months in 2009 for the debt issued in 2009
in connection with the Genentech transaction. This was partly offset by the lower interest expenses following
the repayment and early redemption of some of the bonds and notes during 2009 and 2010. The interest cost
of pension plans was 657 million Swiss francs, which remained stable.
Due to the prevailing financial conditions in the first quarter of 2009, the Group issued bonds and notes in
advance of the Genentech transaction totalling 48.2 billion Swiss francs through a series of debt offerings. The
non-core interest expense on these instruments for the bridging period between their issue and the completion
of the Genentech transaction on 26 March 2009 was 139 million Swiss francs, which were included in the
IFRS financing costs in 2009.
A full analysis of financing costs is given in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income taxes
The Group’s effective tax rate on a core basis decreased slightly by 0.6 percentage points to 21.9% (2009:
22.5%). This reduction was mainly due to three month additional interest costs for the debt raised to finance
the Genentech transaction and losses on early redemption of bonds, both of which were tax deductible
in the US. A tax benefit of 815 million Swiss francs was recorded for the non-core items described above
compared to a tax benefit of 1,565 million Swiss francs in 2009. This was primarily due to lower global
restructuring costs recorded in 2010 as well as the impact from income taxes on equity compensation plans.

In 2010 the Group’s net income increased by 4% to 8.9 billion Swiss francs compared to 2009. This increase
is due to a strong operating performance in spite of significantly lower Tamiflu sales and to overall lower
non-core items such as global restructuring charges and amortisation and impairment of intangible assets.
Excluding non-core items, core net income decreased slightly by 1%, and the portion attributable to Roche
shareholders rose 3%.
IFRS net income attributable to Roche shareholders rose 11% to 8.7 billion Swiss francs. The comparative
period included 431 million Swiss francs attributable to Genentech non-controlling interests until 25 March
2009. The Genentech transaction has a positive impact on net income attributable to Roche shareholders and
earnings per share, as the synergy savings and the elimination of the allocation to non-controlling interests
more than compensate for the costs of financing the transaction.

1) Operating profit cash adjustments include the elimination of depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges for property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets and the replacement of the operating income/expenses for provisions, equity
compensation plans and disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with their cash equivalents. A detailed
breakdown is provided on page 148.
The free cash flow of the Group in 2010 was 4.7 billion Swiss francs, compared to 8.9 billion Swiss francs
in 2009. The decrease of 4.2 billion Swiss francs was driven by higher interest and dividend payments,
the non-recurrence of some one-time tax benefits in 2009 and an increase in net working capital following
the settlement in 2010 of unusually high accruals at the end of 2009.
Although the operating profit increased by 10%, the operating free cash flow decreased by 10%, or
1.6 billion Swiss francs. This was mainly caused by increases in net working capital of 1.3 billion Swiss francs,
in particular due to payments in 2010 of certain large year-end 2009 accruals, notably for Tamiflu royalties
and employee retention and severance schemes. Capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment
included investments in new Pharmaceuticals research and production facilities in Switzerland, Germany
and the United States. Operating profit cash adjustments decreased by 1.4 billion Swiss francs to 5.0 billion
Swiss francs, mainly due to large non-cash items in 2009 from the Genentech integration.
In the first quarter of 2010 large interest payments were made for the new debt issued in 2009 with no
comparable payments in the first quarter of 2009. Some of this debt has only a single annual interest payment
in the first quarter of each year. This is the main reason for the decrease in free cash flow from treasury
activities of 0.7 billion Swiss francs, resulting in an overall outflow of 1.4 billion Swiss francs.
Total taxes paid in 2010 were 2.8 billion Swiss francs. This was higher than in 2009 because the comparative
period total tax payments were unusually low due to the one-time 1.1 billion Swiss francs tax benefit on
the settlement of stock options with Genentech employees upon closing of the Genentech transaction in
March 2009.26
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Financial Review
Total dividends paid in 2010 were 5.3 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 0.9 billion Swiss francs compared to
2009, reflecting the 20% increase of the Roche Group dividend for the year 2009.

The net debt position of the Group was 19.2 billion Swiss francs at the end of 2010, a decrease of
4.7 billion Swiss francs from 31 December 2009. This was mainly due to the free cash flow of 4.7 billion
Swiss francs described above. An outflow of 0.7 billion Swiss francs came mainly from transactions in own
equity instruments which were executed to cover the exposure from equity compensation plans issued to
employees. In addition 0.5 billion Swiss francs were paid in business combinations, mainly for Marcadia. The
net debt position improved also due to a translation gain of 2.9 billion Swiss francs on consolidation of the
total debt in the Group’s US affiliates due to a stronger Swiss franc compared to US dollar. This improvement
was partially offset by payments to the Group of 1.7 billion Swiss francs during 2010 from the hedging and
collateral arrangements, which were set up following the financing of the Genentech transaction (see below).
The Group entered into derivative contracts in 2009 with third parties to hedge the foreign exchange risk
arising from bonds and notes issued in currencies other than US dollar. The total exposure hedged at issuance
of these bonds and notes was approximately 25 billion Swiss francs (see Note 27 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements). Collateral agreements were entered into with the derivative counterparties to mitigate
counterparty risk. As the fair value of the derivative instruments went down due to the strengthening of the
US dollar against the euro during 2010, cash collateral of 1.4 billion Swiss francs was delivered by Roche.
This decreased the 31 December 2009 cash collateral balance in favour of Roche of 1.5 billion Swiss francs
to 0.1 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2010. The collateral balance in relation to the hedges on the
non-US dollar-denominated bonds and notes is mainly sensitive to the foreign exchange rate between the
US dollar and the euro, but also to the Swiss franc and pound sterling. Currently the collateral balance moves
by approximately 180 million US dollars if all of these foreign exchange rates move by 1% simultaneously.
Collateral volatility will decrease to less than 80 million US dollars for each 1% movement in foreign exchange
rates by mid-2013 as the non-US dollar-denominated bonds and notes will be repaid. The realised loss on
derivatives in 2010 was 0.3 billion Swiss francs and relates mainly to hedges on the non-US dollar-
denominated bonds and notes.27
The redemption on due dates in 2010 of the 3 billion US dollar and 1.5 billion euro floating rate notes and
the 0.5 billion US dollar Genentech senior notes and the early redemption of notes on 9 September 2010 with
a principal value of 2.5 billion US dollars that were due 1 March 2012 were the main factors for the decline
of 7.6 billion Swiss francs in liquid funds. However, this had no impact on the net debt position.

Non-current assets | Property, plant and equipment declined in particular due to impairments as a result of
the Operational Excellence announcements regarding site closures in Diagnostics in Austria and Switzerland
and due to the euro and US dollar significantly weakening by 17% and 10% respectively against the Swiss
franc during 2010. Goodwill and intangible assets also declined driven by amortisation, impairments and
the weaker euro. The majority of the impairments of intangible assets results from portfolio prioritisation
decisions as part of the Operational Excellence initiative.28
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Financial Review
Current assets | Accounts receivable and inventories increased only moderately in local currencies, with
the weakening of the euro having an impact on the overall balances in Swiss francs. The carrying value of
derivative assets decreased by 1.3 billion Swiss francs, consistent with the decrease in the carrying value
of the debt that they are hedging. Cash and marketable securities declined by 41% as described in the cash
flows and net debt commentary above.
Debt | The carrying value of debt, mainly from the financing of the Genentech transaction, decreased by
29% to 30.1 billion Swiss francs. This reduction reflects the redemption on due dates 2010 of the 3 billion US
dollar and 1.5 billion euro floating rate notes, the 0.5 billion US dollar Genentech senior notes and the early
redemption on 9 September 2010 of 2.5 billion US dollars of notes that were due 1 March 2012. A detailed
reconciliation of the debt movements is provided in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other non-current and current liabilities | The overall balance decreased by 3.4 billion Swiss francs
mainly due to the repayment of 1.4 billion Swiss francs of collateral payable as the fair value of the derivatives
declined. In addition accounts payable and other accrued liabilities decreased by 3.1 billion Swiss francs due
to the payment in 2010 of accrued royalties, notably in respect of Tamiflu sales in the second half of 2009,
and accrued employee retention/severance schemes.
Total net assets/equity | The most significant movements in equity were the net income of 8.9 billion Swiss
francs and the dividend payments of 5.3 billion Swiss francs. Overall capitalisation, being total debt plus
equity, declined by 20%. Debt was significantly lower due to repayments and equity was higher as the net
income more than offset the dividend. At the end of 2010 equity made up 28% of the capitalisation compared
to 18% a year previously.
Debt
To finance the Genentech transaction, the Group issued bonds and notes equivalent to 48.2 billion Swiss
francs in February and March 2009. Of the bonds and notes raised in early 2009, roughly 33% had already
been repaid by 31 December 2010. This includes the early redemption of notes on 9 September 2010 with
a principal value of 2.5 billion US dollars that were due 1 March 2012.
In addition on 28 December 2010 the Group resolved to exercise its option to call for redemption a portion
of the US dollar 5.00% fixed rate notes due 1 March 2014. Of the total principal amount of 2.75 billion US
dollars, 1.0 billion US dollars will be redeemed on 24 March 2011. This portion of the notes is shown as due
in 2011 in the table below.
The maturity schedule of the Group’s bonds and notes outstanding at 31 December 2010 is shown in the table
below, which includes those instruments that were already in issue prior to the Genentech transaction.29

2) The proceeds from these bonds and notes were swapped into US dollars, and therefore in the financial statements the bonds and
notes have economic characteristics equivalent to US dollar-denominated bonds and notes.
The Group plans to meet its debt obligations using existing liquid funds as well as cash generated from the
ongoing business. In 2010 the free cash flow was 4.7 billion Swiss francs, which includes the cash generated
from operations, as well as payment of interest, tax and dividends. In the second half of 2010 free cash
flow was an inflow of 6.3 billion Swiss francs, while in the first half of 2010 free cash flow was an outflow of
1.6 billion Swiss francs, which included 5.2 billion Swiss francs used for the payment of the annual dividend.
For short-term financing requirements, the Group has a commercial paper programme in the United States
under which it can issue up to 7.5 billion US dollars of unsecured commercial paper notes and committed
credit lines of 2.5 billion euros and 950 million US dollars available as back-stop lines. Commercial paper
notes totalling 0.2 billion US dollars were outstanding as of 31 December 2010. For longer-term financing the
Group maintains strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA– by Standard & Poor’s and A2 by
Moody’s which should facilitate efficient access to international capital markets.
As described above in the commentary on the net debt position, in 2009 the Group entered into derivative
contracts with third parties to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from bonds and notes issued in
currencies other than US dollar. At the same time collateral agreements were entered into with the derivative
counterparties to mitigate counterparty risk.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefit plans are classified as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or
constructive obligation to pay further contributions. In 2010 expenses for the Group’s defined contribution
plans were 305 million Swiss francs (2009: 295 million Swiss francs).
All other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’, even if the Group’s potential obligation is minor or has
a relatively remote possibility of arising. The funding and asset management of the Group’s various defined
benefit plans is overseen at a corporate level. Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the
Group and are funded by payments from the Group and by employees, but in some cases the plan is unfunded
and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources.30

Unfunded plans
– Defined benefit obligation (3,080) (3,486)
Funding status | Overall the funding status of the Group’s defined benefit plans was stable at 93%. The
main movements came from an increase in the fair value of plan assets, which recovered in 2010, offset by an
increase in the defined benefit obligation arising from a decrease in discount rates. The Group continues to
closely monitor the funded status of its major pension funds. In addition to some cash injections, the Group
has initiated plan changes in several local pension plans, with, for example, some of the major pension funds
removing early retirement incentives. The Group continues to introduce more flexible retirement models in
anticipation of an ageing workforce.
Expenses recorded in income statement | Total pension expenses in 2010 relating to the Group’s defined
benefit plans were 330 million Swiss francs compared to 464 million Swiss francs in 2009. The decrease of
29% is primarily due to a higher expected return on plan assets arising mainly as a consequence of a higher
asset base at the start of 2010. In addition there were curtailment gains of 95 million Swiss francs in 2010
compared to 48 million Swiss francs in 2009. Based on the revised actuarial assumptions at the end of 2010,
total pension expenses for 2011 are expected to be broadly stable compared to 2010, excluding curtailment
effects.
Full details of the Group’s pensions and other post-employment benefits are given in Note 10 to the

Proposed dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing an increase of 10% in the dividend for 2010 to 6.60 Swiss francs per
share and non-voting equity security (2009: 6.00 Swiss francs) for approval at the Annual General Meeting.
This is the 24th consecutive increase in the dividend. If the dividend proposal is approved by shareholders,
dividend payments on the shares and non-voting equity securities in issue will amount to 5.7 billion Swiss
francs (2009: 5.2 billion Swiss francs), resulting in a payout ratio (based on core net income) of 52% (2009:
49%). Based on the prices at year-end 2010, the dividend yield on the Roche share is 4.6% (2009: 3.3%) and
the yield on the non-voting equity security is 4.8% (2009: 3.4%). Further information on the Roche securities
is given on pages 149–150 of the Finance Report

Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Financial Review
Financial risks
As at 31 December 2010 the Group has a net debt position of 19 billion Swiss francs (31 December 2009:
24 billion Swiss francs). The financial assets of the Group are managed in a conservative way with the
objective to meet the Group’s financial obligations at all times.
Asset allocation | A considerable portion of the cash and marketable securities the Group currently holds
is being used for debt redemptions. Liquid funds are either held as cash or are invested in high-quality,
investment-grade fixed income securities with an investment horizon to meet those liquidity requirements.
During 2010 Roche reduced its money market portfolio by 7.9 billion Swiss francs as the instruments
matured or were sold.
Cash and marketable securities

(mCHF) (% of total) (mCHF) (% of total)

Money market instruments 7,174 66 15,040 81
Bonds, debentures and other investments 1,614 15 753 4
Shares 272 2 314 2
Total cash and marketable securities 10,901 100 18,549 100
Credit risk | Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their
obligations causing financial losses for the Group. The rating profile of the Group’s 10.6 billion Swiss francs
fixed income marketable securities remained strong with 98% being invested in the A-AAA range. As noted
previously the Group has signed netting and collateral agreements with the counterparties in order to
mitigate counterparty risk on derivative positions.
The Group has trade receivables of 9.7 billion Swiss francs. Since the beginning of the year there have
been increasing financial difficulties in certain Southern European countries, particularly Greece. The
Group is a leading supplier to the Greek healthcare sector and has trade receivables with the Greek public
customers. In the second half of 2010 the Group has accepted an offer made by the Greek government to
settle large parts of trade receivables with zero coupon government bonds, redeemable between 2011 and
2013. Some first government bonds were received in late December 2010. The Group expects to receive the
remaining government bonds during the first half of 2011. The Group is carefully monitoring the situation
and is assessing its options to manage these counterparty exposures. During 2010 bad debt provisions were
increased to reflect these various developments.
Liquidity risk | Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets
due at any point in time. The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available
reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements at any point in time. In addition to the current liquidity
position the Group has strong cash generation ability. Those future cash flows will be used to repay debt
instruments in the coming years.
Despite total debt of 30.1 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2010, Roche enjoys strong long-term
investment-grade credit ratings of AA– by Standard & Poor’s and A2 by Moody’s. At the same time Roche
is rated at the highest available short-term ratings by those agencies. In the event of financing requirements,
the ratings and the strong credit of Roche should permit efficient access to international capital markets,
including the commercial paper market. The Group has committed credit lines with various financial
institutions totalling 4.5 billion Swiss francs (31 December 2009: 5.1 billion Swiss francs) of which 4.0 billion
Swiss francs serve as back-stop line for the commercial paper programme. As at 31 December 2010 no
debt has been drawn under these credit lines.33
Market risks | Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial
liabilities. The exposures are predominantly related to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates
and equity prices. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to assess the impact of market risk on its financial
instruments. VaR data indicates the value range within which a given financial instrument will fluctuate with
a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices. The VaR data in the table below indicates
the economic loss level over a period of one month which with 95% probability will not be exceeded. Actual
future economic gains and losses associated with our treasury activities may differ materially from the
VaR analyses performed due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount
of changes to interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and equity investment prices, particularly
in periods of high market volatilities. Furthermore, the VaR numbers below do not include a credit risk
component.

VaR – Foreign exchange component 44 43
VaR – Other price component 34 57
Diversification (77) (98)
VaR – Total 467 719
At 31 December 2010 the total VaR of the financial assets and liabilities was 467 million Swiss francs
(31 December 2009: 719 million Swiss francs). The interest rate VaR decreased to 466 million Swiss francs
reflecting the ageing of debt, the repayment of debt during 2010 and a higher duration of fixed income assets
held. As all issued debt is held at amortised cost, the interest rate VaR is a sole metric for economic fair value
changes, but there is no impact on the carrying value or profit and loss of the Group. The foreign exchange
VaR basically remained stable. Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities
and declined as equity securities holdings were reduced. At 31 December 2010 the Group held equity
securities with a market value of 0.5 billion Swiss francs (31 December 2009: 0.6 billion Swiss francs). This
includes holdings in biotechnology companies which were acquired in the context of licensing transactions
or scientific collaborations.
Further information on financial risk management and financial risks and the VaR methodology is included in
Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
International Financial Reporting Standards
The Roche Group has been using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to report its
consolidated results since 1990. In 2008 the Group early adopted the revised versions of IFRS 3 ‘Business
Combinations’ and IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’, which were required to be
implemented from 1 January 2010 at the latest. The Group has also implemented various other amendments
to existing standards and interpretations, which have no material impact on the Group’s overall results and
financial position.34

Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated
Financial Statements
Reference numbers indicate corresponding Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of the Roche Group have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. They have been prepared
using the historical cost convention except that, as disclosed in the accounting policies below, certain
items, including derivatives and available-for-sale investments, are shown at fair value. They were approved
for issue by the Board of Directors on 27 January 2011 and are subject to approval by the Annual General
Meeting of shareholders on 1 March 2011.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure
of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. If in the future such estimates and assumptions,
which are based on management’s best judgement at the date of the financial statements, deviate from the
actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the year in
which the circumstances change.
Changes in accounting policies that arise from the application of new or revised standards and interpretations
are applied retrospectively, unless otherwise specified in the transitional requirements of the particular
standard or interpretation. Retrospective application requires that the results of the comparative period and
the opening balances of that period are restated as if the new accounting policy had always been applied.
In some cases the transitional requirements of the particular standard or interpretation specify that the
changes are to be applied prospectively. Prospective application requires that the new accounting policy
only be applied to the results of the current period and the comparative period is not restated. In addition
comparatives have been reclassified or extended from the previously reported results to take into account
any presentational changes.
Consolidation policy
These financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, a company
registered in Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’).
The subsidiaries are those companies controlled, directly or indirectly, by Roche Holding Ltd, where control
is defined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits
from its activities. This control is normally evidenced when Roche Holding Ltd owns, either directly or
indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or currently exercisable potential voting rights of a company’s
share capital. Special Purpose Entities are consolidated where the substance of the relationship is that the
Special Purpose Entity is controlled by the Group. Companies acquired during the year are consolidated from
the date on which control is transferred to the Group, and subsidiaries to be divested are included up to the
date on which control passes from the Group. Inter-company balances, transactions and resulting unrealised
income are eliminated in full. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity
transactions if they occur after control has already been obtained and if they do not result in a loss of control.41
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. These are companies over which the
Group exercises, or has the power to exercise, significant influence, but which it does not control. This is
normally evidenced when the Group owns 20% or more of the voting rights or currently exercisable potential
voting rights of the company. Balances and transactions with associates that result in unrealised income are
eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate. Interests in joint ventures are reported using
the line-by-line proportionate consolidation method.
Segment reporting
The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the organisation units for which
information is reported to the Group’s management. The Group has two divisions, Pharmaceuticals and
Diagnostics. Revenues are primarily generated from the sale of prescription pharmaceutical products and
diagnostic instruments, reagents and consumables, respectively. Both divisions also derive revenue from
the sale or licensing of products or technology to third parties. Certain headquarter activities are reported
as ‘Corporate’. These consist of corporate headquarters, including the Corporate Executive Committee,
corporate communications, corporate human resources, corporate finance, including treasury, taxes and
pension fund management, corporate legal and corporate safety and environmental services. Sub-divisional
information for Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai, the previously aggregated operating segments within
the Pharmaceuticals Division, is also presented.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis. Operating assets and liabilities
consist of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade receivables/payables,
inventories and other assets and liabilities, such as provisions, which can be reasonably attributed to the
reported operating segments. Non-operating assets and liabilities mainly include current and deferred
income tax balances, post-employment benefit assets/liabilities and financial assets/liabilities such as cash,
marketable securities, investments and debt.
Foreign currency translation
Most Group companies use their local currency as their functional currency. Certain Group companies use
other currencies (such as US dollars, Swiss francs or euros) as their functional currency where this is the
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Local transactions in other
currencies are initially reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses from
the settlement of such transactions and gains and losses on translation of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in other currencies are included in income, except when they are qualifying cash flow hedges
or arise on monetary items that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign entity.
In such cases the gains and losses are deferred into equity.
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using functional currencies other than Swiss
francs (foreign entities) are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange. Sales, costs,
expenses, net income and cash flows are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Translation
differences due to the changes in exchange rates between the beginning and the end of the year and the
difference between net income translated at the average and year-end exchange rates are taken directly to
equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, the identified cumulative currency translation differences within equity
relating to that foreign entity are recognised in income as part of the gain or loss on divestment.42
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Revenues
Sales represent amounts received and receivable for goods supplied to customers after deducting trade
discounts, cash discounts and volume rebates, and exclude value added taxes and other taxes directly linked
to sales. Revenues from the sale of products are recognised upon transfer to the customer of significant
risks and rewards. Trade discounts, cash discounts and volume rebates are recorded on an accrual basis
consistent with the recognition of the related sales. Estimates of expected sales returns, charge-backs
and other rebates, including Medicaid in the United States and similar rebates in other countries, are also
deducted from sales and recorded as accrued liabilities or provisions or as a deduction from accounts
receivable. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual or legislatively mandated obligations,
historical trends and the Group’s experience. If the circumstances are such that the level of sales returns,
and hence revenues, cannot be reliably measured, then sales are only recognised when the right of return
expires, which is generally upon prescription of the products to patients. Other revenues are recorded as
earned or as the services are performed. Where necessary, single transactions are split into separately
identifiable components to reflect the substance of the transaction. Conversely, two or more transactions may
be considered together for revenue recognition purposes, where the commercial effect cannot be understood
without reference to the series of transactions as a whole.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and related production overheads of goods
sold and services rendered. Royalties, alliance and collaboration expenses, including all collaboration profit-
sharing arrangements are also reported as part of cost of sales. Start-up costs between validation and the
achievement of normal production capacity are expensed as incurred.
Research and development
Internal research costs are those costs incurred for the purpose of gaining new scientific or technical
knowledge and understanding. These costs are expensed as incurred.
Internal development costs are those costs incurred for the application of research findings or other
knowledge to plan and develop new products for commercial production. Such costs would qualify for
capitalisation as intangible assets only if all of the following criteria can be demonstrated:
• The technical feasibility of completing the development project successfully so that it will be available for
use or sale.
• The intention to complete the development project.
• The ability to use or sell the results of the development project.
• That the development project would generate economic benefits. This would normally be evidenced by
the existence and size of a market for the results of the project itself or the products that would result from
the project.
• The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development project.
• The ability to measure the development expenditure reliably that would qualify for capitalisation as an
intangible asset.
The development projects undertaken by the Group are subject to technical, regulatory and other
uncertainties, such that, in the opinion of management, the criteria for capitalisation are not met prior to
obtaining marketing approval by the regulatory authorities in major markets. Internal development costs
that do not meet these criteria are therefore expensed as incurred.
Post-marketing studies after regulatory approval, such as Phase IV costs in the pharmaceuticals business,
are expensed as incurred. They generally involve safety surveillance and ongoing technical support of a drug
after it receives marketing approval to be sold. They may be required by regulatory authorities or may be
undertaken for safety or commercial reasons. The safety surveillance is designed to detect any rare or long-
term adverse effects over a much larger patient population and longer time period than was possible during
earlier stages of development. The costs of such post-marketing studies are not capitalised as intangible
assets, as in the opinion of management, they do not generate separately identifiable incremental future
economic benefits that can be reliably measured.43
In addition to its internal research and development activities, the Group is also party to in-licensing
and similar arrangements with its alliance partners. The Group may also acquire in-process research and
development assets, either through business combinations or through purchases of specific assets.
In-process research and development resources acquired either through in-licensing arrangements, business
combinations or separate purchases are capitalised as intangible assets if they are controlled by the Group,
are separately identifiable and are expected to generate future economic benefits, even if uncertainty exists
as to whether the research and development will ultimately result in a marketable product. Consequently,
upfront and milestone payments to third parties for pharmaceutical products or compounds before regulatory
marketing approval are recognised as intangible assets. Assets acquired through such arrangements are
measured on the basis set out below in the ‘Intangible assets’ policy and are reviewed for impairment as set
out below in the ‘Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets’ policy. Once available for
use, such intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the expected benefit and
are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date. If research and development are embedded in contracts
for strategic alliances, the Group carefully assess whether upfront or milestone payments constitute funding
of research and development work or acquisition of an asset.
Licensing, milestone and other upfront receipts
Royalty income is recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the respective
licensing agreements. If the collectability of a royalty amount is not reasonably assured, those royalties
are recognised as revenue when the cash is received. Certain Group companies receive from third parties
upfront, milestone and other similar payments relating to the sale or licensing of products or technology.
Revenue associated with performance milestones is recognised based on achievement of the deliverables
as defined in the respective agreements. Upfront payments and licence fees for which there are subsequent
deliverables are initially reported as deferred income and are recognised in income as earned over the
period of the development collaboration or the manufacturing obligation.
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary
benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group.
Where the Group provides long-term employee benefits, the cost is accrued to match the rendering of the
services by the employees concerned. Liabilities for long-term employee benefits are discounted to take into
account the time value of money, where material.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Most employees are covered by defined benefit and defined contribution post-employment plans sponsored
by Group companies. The Group’s contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the appropriate
income statement heading within the operating results in the year to which they relate. The accounting and
reporting of defined benefit plans are based on recent actuarial valuations. The defined benefit obligations
and service costs are calculated using the projected unit credit method. This reflects service rendered by
employees to the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount
rates used in determining the present value of benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth and long-
term expected rates of return for plan assets. Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-quality
corporate bonds in the country concerned. Past service costs are allocated over the average period until the
benefits become vested. Current and past service costs are charged to the appropriate income statement
heading within the operating results. Pension plan administration and funding is overseen at a corporate level
and any settlement gains and losses resulting from changes in funding arrangements are reported as general
and administration expenses within the ‘Corporate’ segment. The expected returns on plan assets and
interest costs are charged to financial income and financing costs, respectively. Actuarial gains and losses,
which consist of differences between assumptions and actual experiences and the effects of changes in
actuarial assumptions, are recorded directly in equity. Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit
plans are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to use the surplus in one plan to settle
obligations in the other plan. The recognition of pension assets is limited to the total of the present value
of any future refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans and any cumulative44
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
unrecognised past service costs. Adjustments arising from the limit on the recognition of assets for defined
benefit plans are recorded directly in equity.
Equity compensation plans
Certain employees of the Group participate in equity compensation plans, including separate plans at
Genentech (prior to the Genentech transaction) and at Chugai. The fair value of all equity compensation
awards granted to employees is estimated at the grant date and recorded as an expense over the vesting
period. The expense is charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results. For
equity-settled plans, an increase in equity is recorded for this expense and any subsequent cash flows from
exercises of vested awards are recorded as changes in equity. For cash-settled plans, a liability is recorded,
which is measured at fair value at each reporting date with any movements in fair value being recorded to
the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results. Any subsequent cash flows from
exercise of vested awards are recorded as a reduction of the liability.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction, and include all
costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable
of operating in the manner intended by management. These include items such as costs of site preparation,
installation and assembly costs and professional fees. The net costs of testing whether the asset is
functioning properly, including validation costs, are also included in the initially recorded cost of construction.
Interest and other borrowing costs incurred with respect to qualifying assets are capitalised and included in
the carrying value of the assets.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis, except for land, which is not
depreciated. Estimated useful lives of major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
Land improvements 40 years
Buildings 10–50 years
Machinery and equipment 5–15 years
Diagnostic instruments 3–5 years
Office equipment 3 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted
for as separate components. The estimated useful life of the assets is regularly reviewed and, if necessary,
the future depreciation charge is accelerated. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Leases
Where the Group is the lessee, leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially
all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised
at the start of the lease at fair value, or the present value of the minimum lease payments, if lower. The
rental obligation, net of finance charges, is reported within debt. Assets acquired under finance leases are
depreciated in accordance with the Group’s policy on property, plant and equipment. If there is no reasonable
certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is depreciated over
the shorter of the lease term and its useful life. The interest element of the lease payment is charged against
income over the lease term based on the effective interest rate method. Leases where substantially all of
the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the period
of the lease.
Where the Group is the lessor, which primarily occurs in the Diagnostics Division, assets subject to finance
leases are initially reported as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Assets
subject to operating leases are reported within property, plant and equipment. Lease income from finance
leases is subsequently recognised as earned income over the term of the lease based on the effective interest
rate method. Lease income from operating leases is recognised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.45
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The consideration
transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. This consideration
includes the cash paid plus the fair value at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or
assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group. The fair value of the consideration transferred also
includes contingent consideration arrangements at fair value. Directly attributable acquisition-related costs
are expensed in the current period and reported within general and administration expenses. At the date
of acquisition the Group recognises the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-
controlling interest in the acquired business. The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
are initially recognised at fair value. Where the Group does not acquire 100% ownership of the acquired
business non-controlling interests are recorded as the proportion of the fair value of the acquired net
assets attributable to the non-controlling interest. Goodwill is recorded as the surplus of the consideration
transferred over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquired net assets. Any goodwill and fair
value adjustments are recorded as assets and liabilities of the acquired business in the functional currency
of that business. When the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete at the end of a
reporting period, provisional amounts are used. During the measurement period, the provisional amounts are
retrospectively adjusted and additional assets and liabilities may be recognised, to reflect new information
obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date which would have affected
the measurement of the amounts recognised at that date, had they been known. The measurement period
does not exceed twelve months from the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortised, but is assessed for
possible impairment at each reporting date and is additionally tested annually for impairment. Goodwill may
also arise upon investments in associates, being the surplus of the cost of investment over the Group’s share
of the fair value of the net identifiable assets. Such goodwill is recorded within investments in associates.
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after
control has already been obtained and if they do not result in a loss of control.
Intangible assets
Purchased patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Where
these assets have been acquired through a business combination, this will be the fair value allocated in
the acquisition accounting. Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis
beginning from the point when they are available for use. Estimated useful life is the lower of the legal
duration and the economic useful life. The estimated useful life of intangible assets is regularly reviewed.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
An impairment assessment is carried out when there is evidence that an asset may be impaired. In addition
intangible assets that are not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. When the recoverable
amount of an asset, being the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, is less than its
carrying value, then the carrying value is reduced to its recoverable amount. This reduction is reported in
the income statement as an impairment loss. Value in use is calculated using estimated cash flows, generally
over a five-year period, with extrapolating projections for subsequent years. These are discounted using
an appropriate long-term pre-tax interest rate. When an impairment loss arises, the useful life of the asset
in question is reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation/amortisation charge is accelerated. The
impairment of financial assets is discussed below in the ‘Financial assets’ policy.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is assessed for possible impairment at each reporting date and is additionally tested annually for
impairment. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units as described in Note 13. When the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit, being the higher of its fair value less costs to sell or its value in use,
is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value of the goodwill is reduced to its recoverable amount.
This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. The methodology used in the
impairment testing is further described in Note 13.46
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods and work in
process includes raw materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs and overheads based upon
the normal capacity of production facilities. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Net
realisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to completion and selling expenses.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts,
trade discounts, cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances. An allowance for doubtful accounts
is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount where there is
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. Trade discounts, cash discounts,
volume rebates and similar allowances are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of
the related sales, using estimates based on existing contractual obligations, historical trends and the Group’s
experience. Long-term accounts receivable are discounted to take into account the time value of money,
where material.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and time, call and current balances with banks and similar
institutions. Such balances are only reported as cash if they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash,
are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date
of acquisition. This definition is also used for the statement of cash flows.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably
lead to an outflow of resources that can be reasonably estimated. In particular, restructuring provisions are
recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan that has either commenced implementation or been
announced. Provisions are recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise, taking into
account foreign currency effects arising from their translation from their functional currency into Swiss francs
and the time value of money, where material. A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the
obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured
with reasonable reliability. Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of
economic benefits is probable.
Fair values
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between
knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by reference to quoted
market prices or by the use of established valuation techniques such as option pricing models and the
discounted cash flow method if quoted prices in an active market are not available (‘fair value hierarchy’).
Valuation techniques will incorporate observable market data about market conditions and other factors that
are likely to affect the fair value of a financial instrument. Valuation techniques are typically used for derivative
financial instruments. The fair values of financial assets and liabilities at the reporting date are not materially
different from their reported carrying values unless specifically mentioned in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements. Information on fair value hierarchy is included in Note 32 on risk management.
Financial assets
Financial assets, principally investments, including marketable securities, are classified as either ‘Fair-value-
through-profit-or-loss’, ‘Available-for-sale’, ‘Held-to-maturity’ or ‘Loans and receivables’. Fair-value-through-
profit-or-loss financial assets are either classified as held-for-trading or designated upon initial recognition.
Held-for-trading financial assets are acquired principally to generate profit from short-term fluctuations in
price. Financial assets are designated as fair-value-through-profit-or-loss if doing so results in more relevant
information by eliminating a measurement or recognition inconsistency. Held-to-maturity financial assets
are securities with a fixed maturity that the Group has the intent and ability to hold until maturity. Loans
and receivables are financial assets created by the Group or acquired from the issuer in a primary market.
They are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market. All other financial assets are considered to be available-for-sale.47
All financial assets are initially recorded at fair value, including transaction costs, except for assets at fair-
value-through-profit-or-loss, which exclude transaction costs. All purchases and sales are recognised
on the settlement date. Fair-value-through-profit-or-loss financial assets are subsequently carried at fair
value, with all changes in fair value recorded as financial income in the period in which they arise. Held-to-
maturity financial assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value, with all unrealised changes in fair
value recorded in equity except for interest calculated using the effective interest rate method and foreign
exchange components. When the available-for-sale financial assets are sold, impaired or otherwise disposed
of, the cumulative gains and losses previously recognised in equity are included in financial income for the
current period. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest
rate method.
Financial assets are individually assessed for possible impairment at each reporting date. An impairment
charge is recorded where there is objective evidence of impairment, such as where the issuer is in
bankruptcy, default or other significant financial difficulty. In addition any available-for-sale equity securities
that have a market value of more than 25% below their original cost, net of any previous impairment, will be
considered as impaired. Any available-for-sale equity securities that have a market value below their original
cost, net of any previous impairment, for a sustained six-month period will also be considered as impaired.
Any decreases in the market price of less than 25% of original cost, net of any previous impairment, which
are also for less than a sustained six-month period are not by themselves considered as objective evidence
of impairment. Such movements in fair value are recorded in equity until there is objective evidence of
impairment or until the asset is sold or otherwise disposed of. For financial assets carried at amortised cost,
any impairment charge is the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount, calculated
using estimated future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate. For available-for-sale
financial assets, any impairment charge is the amount currently carried in equity for the difference between
the original cost, net of any previous impairment, and the fair value. An impairment loss is reversed if the
reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. For debt
securities measured at amortised cost or available-for-sale, the reversal is recognised in income. For equity
securities held available-for-sale, the reversal is recognised directly in equity.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual cash flows from the asset expire or when the Group
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows from the financial assets in a transaction in which
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in
transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is recognised as a separate asset or
liability.
Derivatives
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Apart from those
derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments as discussed in the ‘Hedging’ policy
below, all changes in fair value are recorded as financial income in the period in which they arise. Embedded
derivatives are recognised separately if not closely related to the host contract and where the host contract
is carried at amortised cost.
Hedge accounting
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types. A ‘fair value hedge’
is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or an unrecognised firm
commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to
a particular risk and could affect profit or loss. A ‘cash flow hedge’ is a hedge of the exposure to variability
in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly
probable forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss. A ‘hedge of a net investment in a foreign
operation’ is a hedge of the foreign currency exposure on a net investment in a foreign operation.48
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on
documentation, probability of occurrence (for cash flow hedges), hedge effectiveness and reliability of
measurement. If these conditions are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting.
In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were
no hedging relationship. In particular any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value
included in financial income.
For qualifying fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item is
recorded at its previous carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair value that are attributable to the
hedged risk. Any changes in the fair values are reported in financial income.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of any change
in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity, and any remaining ineffective portion is reported
in financial income. If the hedging relationship is the hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment
or highly probable forecasted transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability,
the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are
included in the initial carrying value of the asset or liability at the date of recognition. For all other qualifying
cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded
in equity are included in financial income when the forecasted transaction affects net income.
For qualifying hedges of net investment in a foreign entity, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair
value. The portion of any change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity. Any remaining
ineffective portion is recorded in financial income where the hedging instrument is a derivative and in equity
in other cases. If the entity is disposed of, then the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument
that have been recorded in equity are reclassified to income.
Debt
Debt instruments are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Subsequently they are reported at amortised cost. Any discount between the net proceeds received and the
principal value due on redemption is amortised over the duration of the debt instrument and is recognised
as part of financing costs using the effective interest rate method. The Group derecognises a financial liability
when its contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
Certain debt instruments have been designated as ‘fair-value-through-profit-or-loss’ where doing so
results in more relevant information as it eliminates or significantly reduces measurement or recognition
inconsistencies. Such debt instruments were reported at fair value, based on quoted prices in an active
market, with movements in fair value reported within financial income. The Group’s last such instrument
was redeemed on 6 July 2009 as disclosed in Note 27.
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding taxes
payable on the distribution of retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based on income, such as
property and capital taxes, are included within general and administration expenses.
Liabilities for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained
earnings, principally relating to subsidiaries, are only recognised where it is probable that such earnings will
be remitted in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements. Deferred income tax assets relating
to the carry-forward of unused tax losses are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.49
Current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the
same taxation authority and when there is a legally enforceable right to offset them. Deferred income taxes
are determined based on the currently enacted tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction where the Group
operates.
Discontinued businesses and non-current assets held for sale
A discontinued business is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of
business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Reclassification as a discontinued business occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria
to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.
A disposal group is a group of assets that are to be disposed of as a group in a single transaction, together
with the liabilities directly associated with those assets that will be transferred in the transaction. The assets
and liabilities in a disposal group are reclassified as held for sale if their value will be recovered principally
through a sale rather than through continuing use. The disposal group must be available for sale in its current
condition and the sale must be highly probable.
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the measurement of all assets and liabilities in a disposal
group is updated in accordance with applicable accounting policies. Then, on initial classification as held for
sale, disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment
losses on initial classification as held for sale are included in the income statement.
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The original
purchase cost, consideration received for subsequent resale of these equity instruments and other
movements are reported as changes in equity. These instruments have been acquired primarily to meet the
potential obligations to employees that may arise in respect of certain of the Group’s equity compensation
plans.
Management judgements made in applying accounting policies
The application of the Group’s accounting policies may require management to make judgements, apart
from those involving estimates, that can have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the
consolidated financial statements. Management judgement is particularly required when assessing the
substance of transactions that have a complicated structure or legal form. These include, but are not
limited to, the following areas:
Revenue recognition | The nature of the Group’s business is such that many sales transactions do not have
a simple structure. Sales agreements may consist of multiple components occurring at different times. The
Group is also party to various out-licensing agreements, which can involve upfront and milestone payments
that may occur over several years. These agreements may also involve certain future obligations. Revenue
is only recognised when, in management’s judgement, the significant risks and rewards of ownership have
been transferred and when the Group does not retain continuing managerial involvement or effective control
over the goods sold or when the obligation has been fulfilled. For some transactions this can result in cash
receipts being initially recognised as deferred income and then released to income over subsequent periods
on the basis of the performance of the conditions specified in the agreement.50
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Consolidation of subsidiaries and associates | The Group periodically undertakes transactions that may
involve obtaining the right to control or significantly influence the operations of other companies. These
transactions include the acquisition of all or part of the equity of other companies, the purchase of certain
assets and assumption of certain liabilities and contingent liabilities of other companies, and entering into
alliance agreements with other companies. Also included are transactions involving Special Purpose Entities
and similar vehicles. In all such cases management makes an assessment as to whether the Group has the
right to control or significantly influence the other company’s operations, and based on this assessment
the other company is consolidated as a subsidiary or associated company. In making this assessment
management considers the underlying economic substance of the transaction and not only the contractual
terms.
Business combinations | Where the Group acquires control of another business, the consideration
transferred has to be allocated to the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-
controlling interest in the acquired business, with any residual recorded as goodwill. This process involves
management making an assessment of the fair value of these items. Management judgement is particularly
involved in the recognition and measurement of the following items:
• Intellectual property. This may include patents, licences, trademarks and similar rights for currently
marketed products, and also the rights and scientific knowledge associated with projects that are
currently in research or development phases.
• Contingencies such as legal and environmental matters.
• Contingent consideration arrangements.
• The recoverability of any accumulated tax losses previously incurred by the acquired company.
In all cases management makes an assessment based on the underlying economic substance of the items
concerned, and not only on the contractual terms, in order to fairly present these items.
Leases | The Group is party to leasing arrangements, both as a lessee and as a lessor. The treatment
of leasing transactions in the financial statements is mainly determined by whether the lease is considered
to be an operating lease or a finance lease. In making this assessment, management looks at the substance
of the lease, as well as the legal form, and makes a judgement about whether substantially all of the risks
and rewards of ownership are transferred. Arrangements which do not take the legal form of a lease but that
nevertheless convey the right to use an asset are also covered by such assessments.
Key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income, expenses and related disclosures. The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on
historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in accounting
estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based,
or as a result of new information or more experience. Such changes are recognised in the period in which
the estimate is revised.
The key assumptions about the future and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next twelve months
are described below.
Revenue recognition | If the circumstances are such that the level of sales returns, and hence revenues,
cannot be reliably measured, then sales are only recognised when the right of return expires, which
is generally upon prescription of the products to patients. In order to estimate this, management uses
publicly available information about prescriptions as well as information provided by wholesalers and other
intermediaries.51
Sales allowances | The Group has provisions and accruals for expected sales returns, charge-backs
and other rebates, including Medicaid in the United States and similar rebates in other countries, which
at 31 December 2010 total 1,155 million Swiss francs. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing
contractual or legislatively-mandated obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience. Management
believes that the total provisions and accruals for these items are adequate, based upon currently available
information. As these deductions are based on management estimates, they may be subject to change as
better information becomes available. Such changes that arise could impact the provisions and accruals
recognised in the balance sheet in future periods and consequently the level of sales recognised in the
income statement in future periods.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill | The Group has property,
plant and equipment with a carrying value of 16,729 million Swiss francs as disclosed in Note 12. Goodwill
has a carrying value of 7,722 million Swiss francs (see Note 13) and intangible assets have a carrying
value of 5,133 million Swiss francs (see Note 14). All of these assets are reviewed annually for impairment
as described above. To assess whether any impairment exists, estimates are made of the future cash
flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal. Actual outcomes could vary
significantly from such estimates of discounted future cash flows. Factors such as changes in the planned
use of buildings, machinery or equipment, or closure of facilities, the presence or absence of competition,
technical obsolescence or lower than anticipated sales of products with capitalised rights could result in
shortened useful lives or impairment. Changes in the discount rates used could also lead to impairments.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits | Many of the Group’s employees participate in post-
employment defined benefit plans. The calculations of the recognised assets and liabilities from such plans
are based upon statistical and actuarial calculations. In particular the present value of the defined benefit
obligation is impacted by assumptions on discount rates used to arrive at the present value of future pension
liabilities, and assumptions on future increases in salaries and benefits. Furthermore, the Group’s independent
actuaries use statistically based assumptions covering areas such as future withdrawals of participants
from the plan and estimates of life expectancy. At 31 December 2010 the present value of the Group’s
defined benefit obligation is 11,464 million Swiss francs for funded plans and 3,080 million Swiss francs for
unfunded plans (see Note 10). The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due
to changes in market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, longer or shorter life spans
of participants, and other changes in the factors being assessed. These differences could impact the assets
or liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Legal provisions | Group companies are party to various legal proceedings, including claims arising from
trade, and the most significant matters are described in Note 25. Legal provisions at 31 December 2010 total
781 million Swiss francs. Management believes that the total provisions for legal proceedings are adequate
based upon currently available information. However, given the inherent difficulties in estimating liabilities
in this area, it cannot be guaranteed that additional costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued.
Additional claims could be made which might not be covered by existing provisions or by insurance. There
can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in the scope of these matters or that any future
lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations will not be material. Such changes that arise could impact the
provisions recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.52
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Environmental provisions | The Group has provisions for environmental remediation costs, which at
31 December 2010 total 261 million Swiss francs, as disclosed in Note 25. The material components of
the environmental provisions consist of costs to fully clean and refurbish contaminated sites, including
landfills, and to treat and contain contamination at certain other sites. Future remediation expenses are
affected by a number of uncertainties that include, but are not limited to, the detection of previously
unknown contaminated sites, the method and extent of remediation, the percentage of the problematic
materials attributable to the Group at the remediation sites relative to that attributable to other parties, and
the financial capabilities of the other potentially responsible parties. Management believes that the total
provisions for environmental matters are adequate based upon currently available information. However, given
the inherent difficulties in estimating liabilities in this area, it cannot be guaranteed that additional costs will
not be incurred beyond the amounts accrued. The effect of the resolution of environmental matters on the
results of operations cannot be predicted due to uncertainty concerning both the amount and the timing
of future expenditures. Such changes that arise could impact the provisions recognised in the balance sheet
in future periods.
Income taxes | At 31 December 2010 the net liability for current income taxes is 1,869 million Swiss francs
and the net asset for deferred income taxes is 1,483 million Swiss francs, as disclosed in Note 6. Significant
estimates are required to determine the current and deferred assets and liabilities for income taxes. Some
of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Management believes
that the estimates are reasonable and that the recognised liabilities for income tax-related uncertainties are
adequate. Various internal and external factors may have favourable or unfavourable effects on the income
tax assets and liabilities. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or
rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, future levels of research and development
spending and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. Such changes that arise could impact the assets
and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Changes in accounting policies
In 2008 the Group early adopted the revised versions of IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ and IAS 27
‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ which were required to be implemented from 1 January
2010 at the latest. In 2010 the Group implemented various amendments to existing standards and
interpretations, which have no material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position.
Presentation of income statement | During 2010 the Group has made certain presentational changes to
the income statement. These have been made in light of current international and industry practice and taking
into account the latest regulatory guidance. These changes, which have been applied retrospectively,
are listed below:
• The term ‘exceptional items’ is no longer used in the financial statements.
• The income statement headings ‘Major legal cases’ and ‘Changes in Group organisation’ are no longer
shown separately on the face of the income statement. Such income and expenses are included as part
of ‘General and administration’. Disclosure is made in Notes 25 and 8 respectively.
• The sub-total for ‘Operating profit before exceptional items’ is deleted as it is redundant.
• The income statement heading ‘Exceptional financing costs’ is no longer shown separately on the
face of the income statement. Such income and expenses are included as part of ‘Financial income’
or ‘Financing costs’, as appropriate. Disclosure is made in Note 5.
• The income statement heading ‘Income taxes on exceptional items’ is no longer shown separately
on the face of the income statement. Such income and expenses are included as part of ‘Income taxes’.
Disclosure is made in Note 6.53
The income statement for the year ended 31 December 2009 has been restated following the above changes
as set out in the table below.

Net income 8,510 – 8,510
Improvements to IFRS: IAS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ | During 2010 the Group has made a minor
presentational change to the statement of cash flows, following the implementation of the ‘Improvements to
IFRS’ issued in April 2009. The only change is that ‘Disposal of products’, totalling 169 million Swiss francs
in 2009, are now reported as operating rather than investing cash flows. The statement of cash flows for the
year ended 31 December 2009 has been restated accordingly.
The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of the other new and revised standards and
interpretations that will be effective from 1 January 2011 and beyond, and which the Group has not early
adopted. The Group does not anticipate that these will have a material impact on the Group’s overall results
and financial position.54

operating income are allocated according to the location of the Group company that receives the revenue.
European Union information is based on members of the EU as at 31 December 2010.57
Major customers
The US national wholesale distributor, AmerisourceBergen Corp., represented approximately 6 billion
Swiss francs (2009: 6 billion Swiss francs) of the Group’s revenues. Approximately 99% of these revenues
were in the Pharmaceuticals operating segment, with the residual in the Diagnostics segment. The Group
also reported substantial revenues from the US national wholesale distributors, Cardinal Health, Inc. and
McKesson Corp., and in total these three customers represented approximately a quarter of the Group’s
revenues.
3. Genentech
Effective 7 September 1990 the Roche Group acquired a majority interest of approximately 60% of Genentech,
Inc., a biotechnology company in the United States. The common stock of Genentech was publicly traded
and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol ‘DNA’. At 31 December 2008 the Group’s
interest in Genentech was 55.8%.
Genentech transaction
On 12 March 2009, Roche entered into a merger agreement with Genentech pursuant to which the Group
made a successful tender offer to purchase all of the shares of Genentech not already owned by the Group
for USD 95.00 per share in cash (the ‘Genentech transaction’). As a result, Genentech became a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Group, effective 26 March 2009.
The cash consideration for the purchase of all public shares, including shares issuable under Genentech’s
outstanding employee stock option plans and payment of related fees and expenses, amounted
to approximately 47 billion US dollars, as set out in the table below. These amounts have been recorded
to equity as a change in ownership interest in subsidiaries in 2009.

Translated at spot rate on date of transaction (26 March 2009) 1 USD = 1.12 CHF
The Group financed the Genentech transaction by a combination of the Group’s own funds, bonds, notes
and commercial paper. The Group raised net proceeds of approximately 48.2 billion Swiss francs through a
series of debt offerings, as described in Note 27. All newly issued debt is senior, unsecured and has been
guaranteed by Roche Holding Ltd.
The impacts of the Genentech transaction and the related reorganisation of Roche’s pharmaceuticals
business on the Group’s results are described in Note 8.58
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
4. Chugai
Effective 1 October 2002 the Roche Group and Chugai completed an alliance to create a leading research-
driven Japanese pharmaceutical company, which was formed by the merger of Chugai and Roche’s Japanese
pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Nippon Roche. The merged company, known as Chugai, is a fully consolidated
subsidiary of the Group. At 31 December 2010 the Group’s interest in Chugai was 61.6% (2009: 61.6%).
The common stock of Chugai is publicly traded and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the stock
code ‘TSE:4519’. Chugai prepares financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in Japan (JGAAP). These are filed on a quarterly basis with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due
to certain consolidation entries and differences in the requirements of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and JGAAP, there are differences between Chugai’s stand-alone results on a JGAAP basis
and the results of Chugai as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS.
Roche’s relationship with Chugai
Chugai has entered into certain agreements with Roche, which are discussed below:
Basic Alliance Agreement | As part of the Basic Alliance Agreement signed in December 2001, Roche and
Chugai entered into certain arrangements covering the future operation and governance of Chugai. Amongst
other matters these cover the following areas:
• The structuring of the alliance.
• Roche’s rights as a shareholder.
• Roche’s rights to nominate members of Chugai’s Board of Directors.
• Certain limitations to Roche’s ability to buy or sell Chugai’s common stock.
Chugai issues additional shares of common stock in connection with its convertible debt and equity
compensation plans, and may issue additional shares for other purposes, which affects Roche’s percentage
ownership interest. The Basic Alliance Agreement provides, amongst other matters, that Chugai will
guarantee Roche’s right to maintain its shareholding percentage in Chugai at not less than 50.1%.
Licensing Agreements | Under the Japan Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in December 2001, Chugai has
exclusive rights to market Roche’s pharmaceutical products in Japan. Chugai also has first right of refusal on
the development and marketing in Japan of all development compounds advanced by Roche.
Under the Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in May 2002, Roche has the right of first
refusal on the development and marketing of Chugai’s development compounds in markets outside Japan,
excluding South Korea, if Chugai decides that it requires a partner for such activities.
Further to these agreements, Roche and Chugai have signed a series of separate agreements for certain
specific products. Depending on the specific circumstances and the terms of the agreement, this may result
in payments on an arm’s-length basis between Roche and Chugai, for any or all of the following matters:
• Upfront payments, if a right of first refusal to license a product is exercised.
• Milestone payments, dependent upon the achievement of agreed performance targets.
• Royalties on future product sales.
These specific product agreements may also cover the manufacture and supply of the respective products to
meet the other party’s clinical and/or commercial requirements on an arm’s-length basis.
Research Collaboration Agreements | Roche and Chugai have entered into research collaboration
agreements in the areas of small-molecule synthetic drug research and biotechnology-based drug discovery.59
Dividends
The dividends distributed to third parties holding Chugai shares during 2010 totalled 99 million Swiss francs
(2009: 87 million Swiss francs) and have been recorded against non-controlling interests (see Note 30).
Dividends paid by Chugai to Roche are eliminated on consolidation as inter-company items.
Chugai share repurchases
During 2009 Chugai repurchased 640,800 of its common shares. As a result the Group’s ownership in
Chugai increased to 61.6% from 61.5%. The total cash outflow, including repurchases of fractional shares,
was 1.2 billion Japanese yen (14 million Swiss francs). There were no share repurchases in 2010.
Other matters
Details of Chugai’s equity compensation plans are given in Note 11.

Genentech transaction financing costs
As described in Note 3, effective 26 March 2009 the Group purchased all publicly owned shares of
Genentech for USD 95.00 per share in cash, with the total cash consideration of the transaction, including
shares issuable under Genentech’s outstanding employee stock option plans and payment of related fees
and expenses, being approximately 52.7 billion Swiss francs.
In order to execute this transaction, the Group liquidated certain debt securities into cash. This resulted
in a net loss on these transactions of 238 million Swiss francs. Furthermore, due to the prevailing financial
conditions, the Group issued bonds and notes in advance of the transaction totalling 48.2 billion Swiss francs
through a series of debt offerings, as described in Note 27. The interest expense on these instruments for
the bridging period between their issue and the completion of the Genentech transaction on 26 March 2009
was 139 million Swiss francs.
These were previously presented as ‘Exceptional financial costs’. As disclosed in Note 1, such income and
expenses are no longer shown separately on the face of the income statement, but are now included as part
of ‘Financial income’ or ‘Financing costs’, as appropriate. Appropriate reclassifications have been made to
the 2009 disclosures in this Note.61
6. Income taxes

Current income taxes (2,569) (3,466)
Adjustments recognised for current tax of prior periods 16 160
Deferred income taxes 233 1,584
Total income (expense) (2,320) (1,722)
As disclosed in Note 1, the income statement heading ‘Income taxes on exceptional items’ is no longer
shown separately on the face of the income statement. Such income and expenses are included as part of
‘Income taxes’. Appropriate reclassifications have been made to the 2009 disclosures in this Note, including
restatement of the reconciliation of the Group’s effective tax rate in the table below.
Since the Group operates internationally, it is subject to income taxes in many different tax jurisdictions. The
Group calculates its average expected tax rate as a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions
in which the Group operates. This rate changes from year to year due to changes in the mix of the Group’s
taxable income and changes in local tax rates. The average expected rate increased in 2010 compared to
2009. There were no significant local tax rate changes in the main operating areas of the Group compared
to 2009. The main driver of the increase comes from the US, which has a relatively higher local tax rate than
the average Group rate. The Group’s taxable profits in the US increased significantly in 2010 which resulted
in an increase in the percentage the US contributes to the overall mix of the Group’s profit. The increased
profit made in the US is mainly due to lower global restructuring costs in the US recorded in 2010 (0.8 billion
US dollars in 2010 compared to 1.8 billion US dollars in 2009). This more than offsets the increased interest
expenses in the US. The Group’s effective tax rate can be reconciled to the Group’s average expected tax rate
as follows:
Reconciliation of the Group’s effective tax rate
2010 2009
Average expected tax rate 20.2% 19.4%
Tax effect of
– Utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses –0.2% –0.1%
– Non-taxable income/non-deductible expenses +0.9% +0.9%
– Equity compensation plans +0.7% –1.0%
– Research, development and other manufacturing tax credits –2.7% –3.3%
– US state tax impacts +1.4% +0.4%
– Other differences +0.4% +0.5%
Group’s effective tax rate 20.7% 16.8%
The impact from equity compensation plans on the effective tax rate 2010 was an increase of 0.7%, while
in 2009 it was a benefit of 1.0%. This is mainly due to the one-time impact of the accelerated vesting of
Genentech plans in 2009. The increased profit contribution from the US also results in higher US state taxes
which increases the Group’s effective tax rate.
The income tax benefits recorded in respect of equity compensation plans, which varies according to the price
of the underlying equity, was 6 million Swiss francs (2009: 77 million Swiss francs, excluding accelerated
vesting impacts from Genentech plans). Had the income tax benefits been recorded solely on the basis of the
IFRS 2 expense multiplied by the applicable tax rate, then benefits of approximately 89 million Swiss francs
(2009: 90 million Swiss francs) would have been recorded.62

currently in Phase I development. Based on Marcadia’s unique peptide chemistry technology, these peptides
are designed to offer patients improved efficacy, safety and convenience.64
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The total purchase consideration was 359 million Swiss francs, of which 273 million Swiss francs was paid in
cash and 86 million Swiss francs arises from a contingent consideration arrangement. The payment from this
arrangement is based on the achievement of two separate performance milestones that may arise between
2013 and 2015 and the range of outcomes, undiscounted, is between zero and 250 million US dollars,
equivalent to 234 million Swiss francs at 31 December 2010 exchange rates. A liability of 86 million Swiss
francs was recognised at the acquisition date, based on management’s best estimate of the probability-
adjusted expected cash outflow from the arrangement. As at 31 December 2010 the amount recognised for
this arrangement was unchanged based on the most recent management estimates.
The purchase consideration has been allocated as shown in the table below. The assets and liabilities and
the amounts allocated to them are provisional based on preliminary information and valuations of the assets
and liabilities of Marcadia. They are subject to adjustment during 2011 if new information is obtained about
the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date.

Lonza Singapore | In 2006 Genentech entered into a supply agreement for the manufacture of certain
Genentech products at a facility under construction in Singapore by Lonza Group Ltd. (‘Lonza’). Genentech
was committed to fund the pre-commissioning production qualification costs at this facility and, upon FDA
licensure, Genentech was committed to purchase 100% of products successfully manufactured at the facility
for a period of three years after commissioning of the facility. Genentech also received an exclusive option
to purchase Lonza’s Singapore facility during the period from 2007 up to one year after FDA licensure for
a purchase price of 290 million US dollars. Genentech also entered into a loan agreement with Lonza to
advance up to 299 million US dollars to Lonza for the construction of the Singapore facility. If Genentech
exercised its option to purchase the facility then any outstanding advances may be offset against the
purchase price. If Genentech did not exercise its purchase option then the advances may be offset against
supply purchases. Regardless of whether the purchase option were exercised, Genentech would be obliged
to make a milestone payment of 70 million US dollars if certain performance milestones were met at the
facility being constructed.67
For accounting purposes, due to the nature of the supply agreement and Genentech’s involvement in the
construction of the buildings, Genentech has been considered to be the owner of the assets during the
construction period even though the funds to construct the building shell and some infrastructure costs are
paid by Lonza. As at 31 December 2008, construction in progress totalling 284 million Swiss francs had been
capitalised and a liability for the financing obligation totalling 46 million Swiss francs had been recorded,
which is net of 225 million US dollars (238 million Swiss francs) that had been advanced by Genentech to
Lonza.
On 28 August 2009 Genentech Singapore Pte. Ltd, (‘Genentech Singapore’) exercised the option to
purchase 100% ownership in Lonza Biologics Singapore Pte. Ltd. (‘Lonza Singapore’). Lonza Singapore
is a cell culture biologic manufacturing facility, which is mechanically complete. It is expected to produce
Avastin (bevacizumab) bulk drug substance, has 80,000 litres of fermentation capacity and is located on
approximately 10 acres with an option for up to 20 additional acres. As part of the integration between
Roche’s and Genentech’s combined technical operations, the biotechnology production facilities in Singapore
have been merged and now operate under the name of Roche Singapore Technical Operations. With the
exercise of the option and resultant merger, approximately 230 Lonza employees joined Genentech Singapore
Technical Operations, for a total site headcount of approximately 325. As at 28 August 2009, under the
previous accounting treatment described above, construction in progress totalling 284 million US dollars
(301 million Swiss francs) had been capitalised and a similar liability for the financing obligation had been
recorded. In addition 225 million US dollars had been advanced by Genentech to Lonza.
The transaction value was 376 million US dollars, which consists of 306 million US dollars for the Singapore
facility and 70 million US dollars of various milestone payments. Of this amount 225 million US dollars was
offset by loans previously made by Genentech to Lonza. The net transaction value was 151 million US dollars
(159 million Swiss francs), of which 108 million US dollars (114 million Swiss francs) was cash payments
in 2009 and 43 million US dollars (46 million Swiss francs) in accrued milestone payments that would be
made in 2010. For accounting purposes, 94 million US dollars (99 million Swiss francs) was allocated to
the settlement of the existing financing obligation and 14 million US dollars (15 million Swiss francs) to the
acquisition of the Lonza Singapore business. This has been allocated as follows:

Other acquisitions | Effective 1 January 2009 the Group acquired an 89.6% controlling interest in Memory
Pharmaceuticals Corp. (‘Memory’), a publicly owned US company based in Montvale, New Jersey, that
had been listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol ‘MEMY’. Memory develops innovative drug candidates
for the treatment of debilitating central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and
schizophrenia. Memory is reported as part of the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment. The acquisition
will further strengthen the Group’s research and development pipeline in areas such as Alzheimer’s disease.
The purchase consideration was 48 million Swiss francs, paid in cash.68
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
There were other minor business combinations in the Diagnostics business with a total purchase
consideration of 57 million Swiss francs, of which 55 million Swiss francs was in cash and 2 million Swiss
francs from a contingent consideration arrangement. A liability of 2 million Swiss francs was recognised at
the acquisition date, based on management’s best estimate at that time of the probability-adjusted expected
cash outflow from the arrangement. As at 31 December 2009 the amount recognised for this arrangement
was reduced to zero, based on the most recent management estimates at that time.

Subsequent to the effective date of the acquisition on 1 January 2009, the Group purchased the remaining
shares in Memory held by third parties to give the Group a 100% interest in Memory. The cash consideration
was 6 million Swiss francs, which has been recorded to equity as a change in ownership interest in
subsidiaries.
Goodwill represents a control premium and synergies that can be obtained from the Group’s existing
business. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The fair value of other net assets (liabilities) includes receivables with a fair value of 4 million Swiss francs
which includes an allowance for doubtful accounts of 1 million Swiss francs.
Directly attributable acquisition-related costs of 2 million Swiss francs were incurred in these acquisitions.
These are reported within general and administration expenses in the current period as part of the operating
result of the Pharmaceuticals operating segment (1 million Swiss francs) and the Diagnostics operating
segment (1 million Swiss francs).

8. Global restructuring plans
Genentech transaction: restructuring and integration
On 21 July 2008 the Group announced an offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Genentech. Following
the closing of the transaction, Genentech’s South San Francisco site would become the headquarters of
the Group’s combined pharmaceuticals operations in the United States. On 21 July 2008 the Group also
announced that Roche’s pharmaceuticals business in the US would close manufacturing operations at its site
in Nutley, New Jersey, and commercial operations would be moved to Genentech. The research site at Palo
Alto, California, would be closed with the research activities being transferred to Nutley and to Genentech.
Subsequent to these announcements, initial restructuring activities started at the Nutley and Palo Alto sites
in 2008.70
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
As described in Note 3, the Genentech transaction was completed effective 26 March 2009. Following this
the Pharmaceuticals Division initiated a detailed integration programme to align the Genentech business
and the rest of the Roche’s pharmaceuticals business. Genentech’s South San Francisco site has now been
established as the headquarters of the pharmaceuticals business in the US, including commercial operations
for the US market. Genentech Research and Early Development has been set up as an autonomous unit while
Genentech’s late-stage development activities have been integrated with the global Pharmaceuticals Division
network. The integration programme included prioritising projects within the shared portfolio and eliminating
activities that were either duplicated or no longer required, notably in the administration function.
Following the completion of the transaction, the Pharmaceuticals Division carried out a detailed reassessment
of its global manufacturing network, with particular emphasis on its biotech manufacturing facilities. As a
result several manufacturing facilities and construction projects have been discontinued, notably a bulk drug
production unit on part of the site at Vacaville in California. In 2009 an impairment charge of 940 million Swiss
francs was recorded in respect of this facility, which had a previous carrying value of 1.3 billion Swiss francs.
Assets with a carrying value of 0.3 billion Swiss francs were subsequently transferred to other facilities for
continuing use.
These restructuring activities have been substantially completed by the end of 2010. The total cost was
3.3 billion Swiss francs, which includes 2.7 billion Swiss francs that were incurred in 2008 and 2009. Of this
total of 3.3 billion Swiss francs approximately 2.0 billion Swiss francs were non-cash.

Operational Excellence
On 17 November 2010 the Group announced details concerning the ‘Operational Excellence’ global
restructuring plan. The plan is aimed at adapting cost structures to an increasingly challenging market
environment and achieving significant efficiency and productivity gains. The planned measures will enable
sustained investment in research and product development and thus strengthen the Group’s long-term
innovation capability.71
Implementation plans include reducing the work force by 4,800 positions worldwide, or 6% of the
Group’s current work force, over the next two years. Most of the planned job reductions will occur in
the Pharmaceuticals Division, particularly in the division’s global sales and marketing organisation and
in manufacturing. Approximately 800 jobs would be transferred to other Roche sites and 700 positions
outsourced to third parties. The combination of planned job reductions and transfers affect 6,300
positions overall.
As part of its plans, the Group intends to seek buyers for its Pharmaceuticals Division manufacturing sites
at Florence, South Carolina and Boulder, Colorado in the United States and the research and development
sites at Kulmbach, Germany and Madison, Wisconsin in the United States. These plans are still at a
preliminary stage and all of these sites are still in operation. Following a comprehensive portfolio review, the
Pharmaceuticals Division has decided to discontinue certain activities in research and early development.
In addition certain product development activities are being discontinued or transferred to other Roche sites
or to third parties. As a result of these decisions intangible assets with a carrying value of 424 million Swiss
francs were fully written down during 2010.
In the Diagnostics Division the sites at Graz in Austria and Burgdorf in Switzerland will be closed. During
2010 impairment charges of 27 million Swiss francs were recorded in respect of these facilities, which had
a previous carrying value of 46 million Swiss francs.
The Group currently anticipates that these restructuring activities will be substantially completed by the end
of 2012. The total cost is expected to be in the order of 2.7 billion Swiss francs, which includes 1.3 billion
Swiss francs that were already incurred in 2010.

in 2009 also include 192 million Swiss francs of expenses related to the Genentech Employee Retention
Program. The charges for employee benefits in the operating results are included in the relevant expenditure
line by function. The expected return on plan assets and interest cost from defined benefit plans are included
as part of financial income and financing costs, respectively (see Note 5).
10. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group’s objective is to provide attractive and competitive post-employment benefits to employees, while
at the same time ensuring that the various plans are appropriately financed and managing any potential
impacts on the Group’s long-term financial position. Most employees are covered by pension plans sponsored
by Group companies. The nature of such plans varies according to legal regulations, fiscal requirements and
market practice in the countries in which the employees are employed. Other post-employment benefits
consist mostly of post-retirement healthcare and life insurance schemes, principally in the United States.
Post-employment benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or
constructive obligation to pay further contributions. All other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’,
even if the Group’s potential obligation is relatively minor or has a relatively remote possibility of arising.
Consequently most of the Group’s post-employment benefit plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’ for
the purpose of these financial statements.
Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans typically consist of payments by employees and by the Group to funds
administered by third parties. Payments by the Group were 305 million Swiss francs (2009: 295 million Swiss
francs). No assets or liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet in respect of such plans, apart
from regular prepayments and accruals of the contributions withheld from employees’ wages and salaries and
of the Group’s contributions.
Defined benefit plans
The Group’s major defined benefit plans are located in Switzerland, the United States, Germany, the United
Kingdom and Japan. Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by
payments from the Group and by employees. In some cases, notably for the major defined benefit plans
in Germany, the plan is unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own
financial resources.
Current and past service costs are charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating
results. Pension plan administration and funding is overseen at a corporate level, and any settlement gains
and losses resulting from changes in funding arrangements are reported as general and administration
expenses within the Corporate segment. The expected returns on plan assets and interest costs are charged
to financial income and financing costs, respectively. Actuarial gains and losses are recorded directly in
equity. The recognition of pension assets is limited to the total of the present value of any future refunds from
the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans and any cumulative unrecognised past service
costs. Adjustments arising from the limit on the recognition of assets for defined benefit plans are recorded
directly in equity.74

The funding of the Group’s various defined benefit plans is overseen at a corporate level. Qualified
independent actuaries carry out valuations on a regular basis and for major plans annually as at the reporting
date. For funded plans, which are usually trusts independent of the Group’s finances, the net asset/liability
recognised on the Group’s balance sheet corresponds to the over/under funding of the plan, adjusted for
unrecognised past service costs. For unfunded plans, where the Group meets the pension obligations directly
from its own financial resources, a liability for the defined benefit obligation is recorded in the Group’s
balance sheet. Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless the Group
has a legally enforceable right to use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan. Amounts
recognised in the balance sheet for post-employment benefits are predominantly non-current and are
reported in non-current assets and liabilities.

Actuarial assumptions
Actuarial assumptions are unbiased and mutually compatible estimates of variables that determine the
ultimate cost of providing post-employment benefits. They are set on an annual basis by local management
and actuaries and are subject to approval by corporate management and the Group’s actuaries. Actuarial
assumptions consist of demographic assumptions on matters such as mortality and employee turnover, and
financial assumptions on matters such as salary and benefit levels, interest rates, return on investments
and costs of medical benefits. The Group operates defined benefit plans in many countries and the actuarial
assumptions vary based upon local economic and social conditions.
Demographic assumptions | The most significant demographic assumptions relate to mortality rates.
The Group’s actuaries use mortality tables which take into account historic patterns and expected changes,
such as further increases in longevity. The mortality tables used for the major schemes are:
• Germany: Heubeck tables 2005G.
• Japan: National Census (No. 20 Life Table).
• Switzerland: BVG 2005.
• United Kingdom: non-pensioners – S1NA_L table rated up 1.5 years (male) and 0.5 years (female). Future
improvements: medium cohort (from 2002) with a 1% underpin (from 2009)
• United Kingdom: pensioners – S1NA_L table rated up 1.5 years. Future improvements: medium cohort
(from 2002) with a 1% underpin (from 2009).
• United States: RP2000 projected to 2017.
Rates of employee turnover, disability and early retirement are based on historical behaviour within Group
companies.
Financial assumptions | These are based on market expectations for the period over which the obligations
are to be settled. The ranges of assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the most significant plans,
which are in countries with stable currencies and interest rates, are shown below.77
Defined benefit plans: financial actuarial assumptions

Weighted Weighted
average Range average Range
Discount rates 4.08% 1.60%–7.20% 4.65% 2.35%–8.50%

Ultimate medical cost trend rate (in 2029) 4.50% 4.50% 4.50% 4.50%
Discount rates, which are used to calculate the discounted present value of the defined benefit obligation,
are determined with reference to market yields on high-quality corporate bonds, or government bonds
in countries where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. The currency and term of the bonds
are consistent with the obligation being discounted. The interest cost included in the income statement is
calculated by multiplying the discount rate by the defined benefit obligation.
Expected returns on plan assets are based on market expectations of expected returns on the assets
in funded plans over the duration of the related obligation. This takes into account the split of the plan
assets between equities, bonds, property and other investments. The calculation includes assumptions
concerning expected dividend and interest income, realised and unrealised gains on plan assets and taxes
and administration costs borne by the plan. These are based on long-term market expectations and the
actual performance is continually monitored by corporate management. Due to the long-term nature of
the obligations, the assumptions used for matters such as returns on investments may not necessarily
be consistent with recent historical patterns. The expected return on plan assets included in the income
statement is calculated by multiplying the expected rate of return by the fair value of plan assets. The
difference between the expected return and the actual return in any twelve-month period is an actuarial
gain/loss and is recorded directly to equity. The actual return on plan assets was a gain of 803 million
Swiss francs (2009: gain of 1,191 million Swiss francs).
Expected rates of salary increases, which are used to calculate the defined benefit obligation and the current
service cost included in the income statement, are based on the latest expectation and historical behaviour
within Group companies.
Medical cost trend rates are used to calculate the defined benefit obligation and the current service cost
included in the income statement of post-employment medical plans. These take into account the benefits
set out in the plan terms and expected future changes in medical costs. Since the Group’s major post-
employment medical plans are for US employees, these rates are driven by developments in the United States.
The effect of one percentage point increase or decrease in the medical cost trend rate is shown below.

Cash flows
The Group incurred cash flows from its defined benefit plans as shown in the table below.

Employer contributions, net of reimbursements – funded plans (196) (333)
Benefits paid – unfunded plans (138) (134)
Total cash inflow (outflow) (334) (467)
Based on the most recent actuarial valuations, the Group expects that employer contributions for funded
plans in 2011 will be approximately 213 million Swiss francs, which includes an estimated 12 million Swiss
francs of additional contributions. Benefits paid for unfunded plans are estimated to be approximately
124 million Swiss francs.
Amounts recorded in equity
The actuarial gains and losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income were losses of 344 million
Swiss francs (2009: losses of 69 million Swiss francs), pre-tax. The total amount at 31 December 2010 was
an accumulated loss of 1,846 million Swiss francs (2009: accumulated loss of 1,502 million Swiss francs).
In addition the recognition of pension assets is limited to the total of the present value of any future refunds
from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans and the cumulative unrecognised past
service costs. Adjustments arising from this limit on asset recognition are recorded directly in equity. In 2010
this adjustment was a decrease of 2 million Swiss francs (2009: decrease of 3 million Swiss francs).79
11. Employee stock options and other equity compensation plans
The Group operates several equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Genentech (prior to
the Genentech transaction) and Chugai. Effective 1 January 2005 the Group adopted IFRS 2 ‘Share-based
Payment’. Amongst other matters, the standard requires that the fair value of all equity compensation plan
awards granted to employees be estimated at grant date and recorded as an expense over the vesting period.
The expense is charged against the appropriate income statement heading. General and administration
costs in 2009 include 236 million Swiss francs of expenses from accelerated vesting of Genentech equity
compensation plans following the Genentech transaction (see Note 8).

Roche Stock Appreciation Rights (19) (17)
The net cash outflow from transactions in own equity instruments arises from sales and purchases of non-
voting equity securities (Genussscheine) and derivative instruments thereon which are held for the Group’s
potential conversion obligations that may arise from the Group’s equity-settled equity compensation plans.
These derivative instruments mainly consist of call options that are exercisable at any time up to their maturity
(see Note 28).
In addition to the above cash flows, upon the completion of the Genentech transaction in 2009 the remaining
outstanding Genentech employee stock options were fully redeemed for cash. The resulting cash outflow was
2,704 million Swiss francs, which was reported as a change in ownership interest in subsidiaries (see Note 3).
Roche Long-Term | During 2005 the Group implemented a new global long-term incentive programme
which is available to certain directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group.
The programme consists of Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (‘S-SARs’), with the Group having
the alternative of granting awards under the existing Roche Option Plan. In 2009, following the integration
of Genentech, the Group also established a Restricted Stock Unit (‘RSU’) plan. The first awards of this
plan were made in September 2009 to employees at Genentech. The S-SARs are issued in accordance
with the Roche S-SAR Plan (the Regulations of 1 January 2005 including amendments effective as of
1 January 2007 and the addenda, including the Roche S-SAR Plan’s 2009 Addendum United States as of
1 September 2009). The Remuneration Committee determines the number of non-voting equity securities
(Genussscheine) that will be available under the plan each year. The above regulations collectively provide
that 60 million non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine) will be available for issuance under the Roche
S-SAR Plan over a ten-year period. The RSUs are issued in accordance with the Roche Restricted Stock
Unit Plan (the Regulations effective 1 September 2009), under which 10 million non-voting equity securities
(Genussscheine) will be available for issuance over a ten-year period. Further details of both plans are given
in the relevant sections below.81
Share option plans
Roche Option Plan | Awards under this plan give employees the right to purchase non-voting equity
securities (Genussscheine) at an exercise price specified at the grant date. The options, which are non-
tradable equity-settled awards, have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years,
subject to continued employment. The Group covers such obligations by purchasing non-voting equity
securities or derivatives thereon (see Note 28). With the introduction of Roche Long-Term in 2005,
the number of options granted under the Roche Option Plan was significantly reduced, as most eligible
employees now receive Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights instead.

Genentech Stock Option Plan | The Genentech Stock Option Plan was adopted in 1999 and amended
thereafter. In April 2004 Genentech’s shareholders approved an equity incentive plan. The plans allowed
for the granting of various stock options, incentive stock options and stock purchase rights to employees,
directors and consultants of Genentech. The options granted, which were non-tradable equity-settled
awards, had a ten-year duration and vested on a phased basis over four years, subject to continued
employment. Upon the completion of the Genentech transaction (see Note 3) the remaining outstanding
options were fully redeemed for cash. For accounting purposes the remaining fair value of 217 million
Swiss francs was expensed for the options that were not fully vested at that time.82

The programme allows for the granting of rights to employees and directors of Chugai. Each right entitles
the holder to purchase 100 Chugai shares at a specified exercise price. The rights, which are non-tradable
equity-settled awards, have a ten-year duration and vest after two years.

Volatility for Roche and Chugai options was determined primarily by reference to historically observed prices
of the underlying equity. Risk-free interest rates are derived from zero coupon swap rates at the grant date
taken from Datastream. The early exercise factor describes the ratio between the expected market price
at the exercise date and the exercise price at which early exercises can be expected, based on historically
observed behaviour.
Other equity compensation plans
Special Stock Awards | In March and December 2009 the Group issued Special Stock Awards to certain
directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The awards consisted of
immediately vesting non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine). The fair value of the awards was calculated
on the basis of the market value of Roche non-voting equity securities at the date of issue.
Roche Connect | This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the United States
and certain other countries, to make regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting equity
securities (Genussscheine). It is administered by independent third parties. The Group contributes to the
programme, which allows the employees to purchase non-voting equity securities at a discount (usually
20%). The administrator purchases the necessary non-voting equity securities directly from the market.
At 31 December 2010 the administrator held 1.9 million non-voting equity securities (2009: 1.6 million).
The programme has been operational since 1 October 2002. During the year the cost of the plan was
14 million Swiss francs (2009: 13 million Swiss francs), which was reported within the relevant expenditure
line by function.
Genentech Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP) | Genentech had an employee stock purchase
programme that allowed employees to purchase Genentech’s common stock at 85% of the lower of market
value at the grant date or purchase date. In 2009 a total of 0.4 million shares of Genentech common stock
were purchased resulting in a cash inflow of 27 million Swiss francs and the cost of the plan was 37 million
Swiss francs, which was reported within the relevant expenditure line by function. Upon the completion
of the Genentech transaction (see Note 3) the remaining outstanding awards were fully redeemed for cash.
For accounting purposes the remaining fair value of 19 million Swiss francs was expensed for the awards
that were not fully vested at that time.84

Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights | With the introduction of Roche Long-Term in 2005,
the Group offers Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) to certain directors, management and
employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The S-SARs give employees the right to receive non-
voting equity securities (Genussscheine) reflecting the value of any appreciation in the market price of the
non-voting equity securities between the grant date and the exercise date. The rights, which are non-tradable
equity-settled awards, have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years, subject
to continued employment. The Group covers such obligations by purchasing non-voting equity securities,
or derivatives thereon (see Note 28).

The weighted average fair value of the rights granted in 2010 was calculated using a binomial model. The
inputs to the model were consistent with those used for the Roche Option Plan 2010 awards given previously,
except that the early exercise factor was 1.280 and the expected exit rate was 7.55%. The resulting weighted
average fair value per right is CHF 15.16 giving a total fair value of 244 million Swiss francs which is charged
over the vesting period of three years.
Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan | For the first time in September 2009 the Group issued Restricted
Stock Units (RSUs) awards to certain directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of
the Group. The RSUs, which are non-tradable, represent the right to receive non-voting equity securities
(Genussscheine) which vest only after a three-year period. The weighted average fair value of the awards
granted in 2010 was CHF 123.55 calculated on the basis of the market value of Roche non-voting equity
securities at the date of issue, discounted to take into account that the awards would not accrue for any
dividends during the vesting period.85

Chugai Retirement Stock Acquisition Rights | For the first time in 2009 Chugai issued Stock Acquisition
Rights in lieu of the Retirement Gratuities System for Directors which was abolished. The 716 rights issued
in 2010 (2009: 785) have a thirty-year duration and vest upon the holder’s retirement as a director of Chugai.
Each right entitles the holder to purchase 100 Chugai shares at an exercise price of 100 Japanese yen.
The total fair value of rights issued was equivalent to 1 million Swiss francs (2009: 1 million Swiss francs),
which was calculated using a binomial model with inputs consistent with those used for the Chugai Stock
Appreciation Rights given previously.
Roche Performance Share Plan | The Group offers future non-voting equity security awards (or, at the
discretion of the Board of Directors, their cash equivalent) to certain directors and key senior managers.
The programme was established at the beginning of 2002 and currently operates in annual three-year cycles.
The terms of the currently outstanding awards are set out in the table below. The amount of non-voting equity
securities allocated will depend upon the individual’s salary level, the achievement of performance targets
linked to the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (shares and non-voting equity securities combined) relative
to the Group’s peers during the three-year period from the date of the grant, and the discretion of the Board
of Directors. These are non-tradable equity-settled awards. Each award will result in between zero and two
non-voting equity securities, depending upon the achievement of the performance targets.

The weighted average fair value of the 107,796 awards granted in 2010 was calculated using a Monte Carlo
simulation. The input parameters to the model were the covariance matrix between Roche and the other
individual companies of the peer group based on a three-year history and a risk-free rate of 0.59%. The
valuation also takes into account the defined rank and performance structure which determines the payout
of the plan.86

Roche Stock Appreciation Rights | Some employees of certain North American subsidiaries of the
Group receive Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) as part of their compensation. The SARs, which are non-
tradable cash-settled awards, may be exercised after a vesting period of between one and three years for
a cash payment, based upon the amount by which the market price of the Group’s American Depositary
Receipts (ADRs) at the point of exercise exceeds the strike price (grant price at issuance). Following the
implementation of Roche Long-Term (see above), the Group does not plan to award any further cash-settled
SARs and no awards have been made since 2004.

Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the
use of the asset and its eventual disposal. Factors such as changes in the planned use of buildings, machinery
or equipment, or closure of facilities, the presence or absence of competition and technical obsolescence
could result in shortened useful lives or impairment. Impairment charges of 61 million Swiss francs (2009:
30 million Swiss francs) are reported as part of ‘Cost of sales’, 71 million Swiss francs (2009: 14 million
Swiss francs) in ‘Research and development’ and 6 million Swiss francs (2009: 1,083 million Swiss francs)
are reported within ‘General and administration’. The major part of the impairment reported in ‘General and
administration’ in 2009 related to the discontinuation of a bulk drug production unit on part of the site at
Vacaville in California (see Note 8).88

Genentech leasing arrangements
In December 2004 Genentech entered into a Master Lease Agreement with Slough SSF LLC, which was
subsequently acquired by Health Care Properties (‘HCP’) for the development of property adjacent to
Genentech’s South San Francisco site. The development includes a total of eight buildings, which are
subject to separate agreements as contemplated by the Master Lease Agreement. HCP as the developer
will construct the building shell for each building and Genentech will finish the interior of each building as
laboratory or office space, as applicable. The construction of the first buildings was completed in 2006,
at which point the lease term for those buildings was deemed to begin. Construction of the final buildings
was completed during 2008. The lease term expires twelve years from the occupation of the final building.
Genentech has two five-year renewal options for each building and has an option to purchase the various
buildings at different dates between 2016 and 2020. Genentech also has a right of first refusal with respect
to each building or the entire development should HCP consider selling part or all of the development.
As at 31 December 2010 the total carrying value of property, plant and equipment from this agreement
was 174 million Swiss francs (2009: 213 million Swiss francs) and the carrying value of Genentech leasing
obligations was 237 million Swiss francs (2009: 273 million Swiss francs). Estimates of the total future
minimum lease payments anticipated by the entire Master Lease Agreement are shown below.

There are no accumulated impairment losses in goodwill. The goodwill arising from investments in associates
is classified as part of the investments in associates (see Note 15).
Goodwill impairment testing
Pharmaceuticals Division | The division’s sub-divisions are the cash-generating units used for the testing
of goodwill. For Chugai, the recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs to sell, determined with
reference to the publicly quoted share prices of Chugai shares. For Roche Pharmaceuticals, the recoverable
amount used in the impairment testing is based on value in use. The cash flow projections used are based
on the most recent business plans approved by management. These assume no significant changes in the
organisation of the division and include management’s latest estimates on sales volume and pricing, and
production and other operating costs. These reflect past experience and are projected over five years. The
cash flow projections used do not extend beyond management’s most recent business plans. The discount
rate used is based on a rate of 7.31%, which is derived from a capital asset pricing model using data from
Swiss capital markets, including Swiss Federal Government twenty-year bonds and the Swiss Market Index.
A weighted average tax rate of 24.98% is used in the calculations. Management believes that any reasonably
possible change in any of the key assumptions would not cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed the
recoverable amount.
Diagnostics Division | The division’s business areas are the cash-generating units used for the testing of
goodwill. The goodwill arising from the Corange/Boehringer Mannheim acquisition and part of the goodwill
from the Ventana acquisition is recorded and monitored at a divisional level as it relates to the strategic
development of the whole division and cannot be meaningfully allocated to the division’s business areas.
Therefore the cash-generating unit for this goodwill is the entire division. The recoverable amount used in
the impairment testing is based on value in use. The cash flow projections used are based on the most recent
business plans approved by management. These assume no significant changes in the organisation of the
division and include management’s latest estimates on sales volume and pricing, and production and other91
operating costs. These reflect past experience and are projected over five years. The estimates for the Tissue
Diagnostics business area are projected over ten years, which management believes reflects the long-term
nature of this business. The cash flow projections used do not extend beyond management’s most recent
business plans. The discount rate used is based on a rate of 7.31%, which is derived from a capital asset
pricing model using data from Swiss capital markets, including Swiss Federal Government twenty-year bonds
and the Swiss Market Index. A weighted average tax rate of 19.71% is used in the calculations. Management
believes that any reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would not cause the carrying
value of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.

Impairment of intangible assets
Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the
use of the asset and its eventual disposal. Factors such as the presence or absence of competition, technical
obsolescence or lower than anticipated sales for products with capitalised rights could result in shortened
useful lives or impairment.
2010 | In 2010 the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment recorded an impairment charge of 634 million
Swiss francs and the Diagnostics operating segment recorded an impairment charge of 33 million Swiss francs.
Of the amount recorded in the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment, an impairment charge of
424 million Swiss francs was recorded as part of the Operational Excellence programme (see Note 8). As
part of the programme the division carried out a comprehensive portfolio review and decided to discontinue
certain activities in research and early development. In addition certain product development activities
are being discontinued or transferred to other Roche sites or to third parties. As a result of these decisions
intangible assets with a carrying value of 424 million Swiss francs were fully written down during 2010.
Apart from the Operational Excellence programme, an impairment charge of 179 million Swiss francs was
also recorded in the Pharmaceuticals Division with respect to product intangibles not available for use and
follows primarily from recent clinical data and portfolio prioritisation decisions relating to certain projects
either with alliance partners or acquired in business combinations. The assets concerned, which were not yet
being amortised, were fully written down by these charges. A further charge of 47 million Swiss francs was
recorded, resulting from a portfolio prioritisation decision on a project acquired as part of a previous business
combination. The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was written down to its recoverable
value of 95 million Swiss francs, based on a value in use calculation using a discount rate of 7.31%. A reversal
of previously recorded impairment loss of 16 million Swiss francs was recorded, which followed from the
latest clinical data assessment of the project concerned.
In the Diagnostics operating segment, an impairment charge of 33 million Swiss francs was recorded.
This was in respect of intangible assets in use and followed the regular updating of the division’s business
plans and technology assessments in the second half of 2010. The assets concerned were written down
to their recoverable amount of 23 million Swiss francs, based on a value in use calculation using a discount
rate of 7.31%.
2009 | In 2009 the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment recorded an impairment charge of 588 million
Swiss francs and the Diagnostics operating segment recorded an impairment charge of 80 million Swiss francs.
In the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment an impairment charge of 286 million Swiss francs was
recorded related to the Pharmaceuticals Division reorganisation (see Note 8). The integration programme
included prioritising projects within the shared portfolio. The assets concerned were fully written down by
these charges. An impairment charge of 286 million Swiss francs was also recorded in respect of product
intangibles not available for use and followed from recent clinical data and portfolio prioritisation decisions
relating to certain projects either with alliance partners or acquired in business combinations. The assets
concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were written down to their recoverable amount of 321 million
Swiss francs, based on a value in use calculation using a discount rate of 7.7%. In addition an impairment
charge of 16 million Swiss francs was recorded relating to intangible assets in use. These followed the regular
updating of the division’s business plans and technology assessments in the second half of 2009. The assets
were written down to their recoverable amount of 66 million Swiss francs, based on a value in use calculation
using a discount rate of 7.7%.94
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
In the Diagnostics operating segment an impairment charge of 80 million Swiss francs was recorded. This was
in respect of intangibles assets in use and followed the regular updating of the division’s business plans
and technology assessments in the second half of 2009. The assets were written down to their recoverable
amount of 71 million Swiss francs, based on a value in use calculation using a discount rate of 7.7%.
Intangible assets not available for use | These mostly represent in-process research and development
assets acquired either through in-licensing arrangements, business combinations or separate purchases.
As at 31 December 2010 the carrying value of such assets in the Pharmaceuticals Division is 1,548 million
Swiss francs. Of this amount approximately 49% represents projects that have potential decision points
within the next twelve months which in certain circumstances could lead to impairment. Due to the inherent
uncertainties in the research and development process, such assets are particularly at risk of impairment
if the project in question does not result in a commercialised product.
Potential commitments from alliance collaborations
The Group is party to in-licensing and similar arrangements with its alliance partners. These arrangements
may require the Group to make certain milestone or other similar payments dependent upon the achievement
of agreed objectives or performance targets as defined in the collaboration agreements.
The Group’s current estimate of future third-party commitments for such payments is set out in the table
below. These figures are not risk adjusted, meaning that they include all such potential payments that can
arise assuming all projects currently in development are successful. The timing is based on the Group’s
current best estimate. These figures do not include any potential commitments within the Group, such as
may arise between the Roche and Chugai businesses.

Financial long-term assets are held for strategic purposes and are classified as non-current. The available-
for-sale investments are mainly equity investments. These are primarily investments in private biotechnology
companies, which are kept as part of the Group’s strategic alliance efforts. Some unquoted equity investments
classified as available-for-sale are measured at cost, as their fair value cannot be measured reliably.
The carrying value of equity investments held at cost is 39 million Swiss francs (2009: 34 million Swiss francs,
2008: 25 million Swiss francs). Loans receivable comprise all loans to third parties with a term of over
one year.

Derivative financial instrument assets are primarily related to hedges on the non-US dollar-denominated
bonds and notes issued to finance the Genentech transaction. The decline compared to 31 December 2010 is
mainly due to a strengthening of the US dollar compared to the euro during 2010. This was offset by foreign
currency transaction gains on the non-US dollar-denominated bonds and notes (see Note 27).

Hedge accounting
The Group’s accounting policy on hedge accounting, which is described in Note 1, requires that to qualify for
hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability
of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
As described in Note 32, the Group has financial risk management policies for foreign exchange risk, interest
rate risk, market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. When deemed appropriate, certain of the above risks are
managed by using derivatives. While many of these transactions can be considered as hedges in economic
terms, if the required conditions are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting.
In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no
hedging relationship, which means that any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value
included in financial income.
The Group generally limits the use of hedge accounting to certain significant transactions. Consequently as
at 31 December 2010 the Group has no fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investment in
a foreign entity that meet the strict requirements to qualify for hedge accounting, apart from those described
below.100
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Cash flow hedges
The Group has issued bonds and notes in 2009 to finance the Genentech transaction (see Note 27).
On some of the bonds and notes which are denominated in euros and sterling, the Group has entered into
cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk. These cash flow hedges qualify for
hedge accounting. As at 31 December 2010 such instruments, which are designated and qualify for hedge
accounting, are recorded as assets with a fair value of 356 million Swiss francs (2009: assets of 1,698 million
Swiss francs). There was no ineffective portion.
The expected undiscounted cash flows from qualifying cash flow hedges, including interest payments during
the duration of the derivative contract and final settlement on maturity, are shown in the table below. The
decline in expected cash flows is due to a stronger Swiss franc against the euro, US dollar and pound sterling.

The undiscounted cash flows in the table above will affect profit and loss as shown below. These include
interest payments during the duration of the derivative contract but do not include the final settlement on
maturity. The decline in expected cash flows is due to a stronger Swiss franc against the euro, US dollar
and pound sterling.

The changes in the hedging reserve within equity are shown in Note 28.101
Fair value hedges
As at 31 December 2009 the Group had hedged some of its fixed-term debt instruments with interest rate
swaps. These instruments, which had been designated and qualified as fair value hedges, were recorded
in the balance sheet at 31 December 2009 as assets with a fair value of 11 million Swiss francs. These
instruments expired in July 2010 when the underlying bond was redeemed. During 2010 a loss of 11 million
Swiss francs was recorded on these interest rate swaps (2009: loss of 9 million Swiss francs). As the fair
value hedge had been highly effective since inception, the result of the interest rate swaps was largely offset
by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt instruments.
The Group has equity investments in various biotechnology companies that are subject to a greater risk of
market fluctuation than the stock market in general. To manage part of this exposure the Group has entered
into forward contracts, which have been designated and qualify as fair value hedges. As at 31 December
2010 such instruments are recorded as liabilities with a fair value of 7 million Swiss francs (2009: assets
of 20 million Swiss francs). During 2010 a loss of 27 million Swiss francs was recorded on these forward
contracts (2009: loss of 22 million Swiss francs). The result of the forward contracts is offset by the changes
in the fair value of the hedged equity investments.
The Group uses other derivatives, not designated in a qualifying hedge relationship, to manage its exposures
to foreign currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. The instruments used may include interest
rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, forwards contracts, options.102

Legal provisions
Legal provisions consist of a number of separate legal matters, including claims arising from trade, in various
Group companies. The majority of any cash outflows for these other matters are expected to occur within
the next one to three years, although these are dependent on the development of the various litigations.
Significant provisions are discounted by between 4% and 5% where the time value of money is material.103
Environmental provisions
Provisions for environmental matters include various separate environmental issues in a number of countries.
By their nature the amounts and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict. The estimated timings of these
cash outflows are shown in the table above. Significant provisions are discounted by between 5% and 6%
where the time value of money is material.
Restructuring provisions
These arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of business undertaken by the Group
or the manner in which business is conducted. Such provisions include only the costs necessarily entailed
by the restructuring which are not associated with the recurring activities of the Group. The timings of these
cash outflows are reasonably certain on a global basis and are shown in the table above. These provisions are
not discounted as the time value of money is not material in these matters.
Employee provisions
These mostly relate to certain employee benefit obligations, such as sabbatical leave and long-service
benefits. The timings of these cash outflows can be reasonably estimated based on past performance and
are shown in the table above. Significant provisions are discounted by 6% where the time value of money
is material.
Other provisions
Other provisions mostly relate to sales returns and various other provisions from Group companies that do
not fit into the above categories. The timings of cash outflows are by their nature uncertain and the best
estimates are shown in the table above. These provisions are not discounted as the time value of money is not
material in these matters.
Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees, to be affected
by political, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating to environmental
protection, in the countries in which it operates. The industries in which the Group operates are also subject
to other risks of various kinds. The nature and frequency of these developments and events, not all of which
are covered by insurance, as well as their effect on future operations and earnings, are not predictable.
The Group has entered into strategic alliances with various companies in order to gain access to potential
new products or to utilise other companies to help develop the Group’s own potential new products. Potential
future payments may become due to certain collaboration partners achieving certain milestones as defined in
the collaboration agreements. The Group’s best estimates of future commitments for such payments are given
in Note 14.
Pharmaceuticals legal cases
Accutane | Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (‘HLR’) and various other Roche affiliates have been named as
defendants in numerous legal actions in the United States and elsewhere relating to the acne medication
Accutane. The litigation alleges that Accutane caused certain serious conditions, including, but not limited
to, inflammatory bowel disease (‘IBD’), birth defects and psychiatric disorders. As of 31 December 2010 HLR
was defending approximately 2,422 actions brought in various federal and state courts throughout the United
States for personal injuries allegedly resulting from their use of Accutane. Most of the actions allege IBD as
a result of Accutane use. On 26 June 2009 HLR announced that, following a re-evaluation of its portfolio of
medicines that are now available from generic manufacturers, rapidly declining brand sales in the US and
high costs from personal-injury lawsuits that it continues to defend vigorously, it had decided to immediately
discontinue the manufacture and distribution of the product in the United States.104
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
All of the actions pending in federal court alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a
Multi-District Litigation in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division.
In July 2007 the District Court granted summary judgment in favour of HLR in the lead federal IBD cases.
The plaintiffs appealed and in August 2008 these rulings were affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals
for the Eleventh Circuit. In October 2009 the District Court granted summary judgment in favour of HLR in
the next five federal IBD cases. The plaintiffs appealed in November 2009 and in May 2010 these rulings were
affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Several recently filed matters remain
pending.
All of the actions pending in state court in New Jersey alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial
proceedings in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County. As of 31 December 2010
juries in the Superior Court have ruled in favour of the plaintiff in six cases, assessing total compensatory
damages totalling 48 million US dollars. The first verdict was reversed on appeal; the re-trial resulted in
a verdict in favour of the plaintiff assessing total compensatory damages of 25.2 million US dollars; HLR
is currently in the process of post-trial briefing. The second verdict was reversed on appeal; the re-trial is
scheduled for May 2011; additional plaintiffs may be added to the trial. HLR has appealed the third verdict
to the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, which involved three plaintiffs. The next trial,
involving three plaintiffs, is scheduled for February 2011.
In October 2007 a jury in the Circuit Court of Escambia County, Florida, returned a verdict in favour of the
plaintiff, assessing total compensatory damages of 7 million US dollars, subsequently reduced to 6.8 million
US dollars by the court, against the Company. In October 2009, the District Court of Appeal, State of Florida,
reversed and entered judgment as to HLR. The Supreme Court of Florida declined to review plaintiff’s appeal.
Additional trials may be scheduled for 2011. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including
many that are unique to the particular case and therefore the trial results to date may not be predictive of
future trial results. The Group continues to defend vigorously the remaining personal injury cases and claims.
Boniva | HLR and various other Roche affiliates have been named as defendants in numerous legal actions
in the United States relating to the post-menopausal osteoporosis medication Boniva. In these litigations,
the plaintiffs allege that Boniva caused one of the following conditions: osteonecrosis of jaw (‘ONJ’), atypical
femoral fractures, or severe bone pain. As of 31 December 2010 HLR is defending approximately 30 actions
brought in federal and state courts in the States of New Jersey, New York and California for personal injuries
allegedly resulting from the use of Boniva.
All of these Boniva cases are in the early discovery stages of litigation, with no trial dates having been
set. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including many that are unique to the particular
case. HLR and the other named Roche affiliates intend to vigorously defend themselves in these matters.
The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Cabilly patent | On 30 May 2008 Centocor, Inc. filed a patent lawsuit against Genentech and City of Hope
National Medical Center (‘City of Hope’) in the US District Court for the Central District of California. The
lawsuit related to US Patent No. 6,331,415 (‘the Cabilly patent’) that is co-owned by Genentech and the City
of Hope. The Cabilly patent, which expires in 2018, relates to methods used by Genentech and others to
make certain antibodies or antibody fragments, as well as cells and DNA used in these methods. Genentech
has licensed the Cabilly patent to other companies and derives significant royalties from these licences. The
lawsuit sought a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity and unenforceability with regard to the Cabilly
patent and of patent non-infringement with regard to certain of Centocor’s products. On 30 August 2010
Genentech and Centocor entered into a settlement agreement resolving this lawsuit and certain additional
patent issues. The agreement was effective as of 30 April 2010 with regard to royalties that Centocor has
agreed to pay for licenses under the Cabilly patent. This matter has been finally resolved.105
On 8 October 2009, Glaxo Group Limited, SmithKline Beecham Corporation, and GlaxoSmithKline LLC
(collectively ‘GSK’) filed a patent lawsuit against Genentech and City of Hope in the US District Court for
the Southern District of Florida. The lawsuit relates to the Cabilly patent and seeks a declaratory judgment
of patent invalidity and unenforceability with regard to the Cabilly patent and of patent non-infringement
with regard to a certain GSK product. On 16 December 2009 Genentech filed a motion to dismiss, or in the
alternative to transfer to the Central District of California. GSK dismissed its Florida lawsuit in its entirety on
17 February 2010 and filed a related action on the same day in Northern District of California. Genentech
filed a motion to transfer to the Central District of California, an answer, and a counterclaim against GSK
on 10 March 2010. On 12 April 2010 Genentech’s motion to transfer was granted. On 13 October 2010 the
Court entered an Order related to claim construction matters, including setting a Markman hearing date
of 14 February 2011. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Other litigation | On 28 June 2003 Mr Ubaldo Bao Martinez filed a lawsuit against the Porriño Town Council
and Genentech España S.L. in the Contentious Administrative Court Number One of Pontevedra, Spain.
The lawsuit challenged the Town Council’s decision to grant licenses to Genentech España S.L. for the
construction and operation of a warehouse and biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Porriño, Spain.
On 16 January 2008 the Administrative Court ruled in favour of Mr Bao on one of the claims in the lawsuit and
ordered the closing and demolition of the facility, subject to certain further legal proceedings. On 12 February
2008 Genentech España S.L. and the Town Council filed appeals of the Administrative Court decision at the
High Court in Galicia, Spain. On 16 March 2010 Genentech received notice that it prevailed over Mr Bao on
the appeal. This decision revokes the January 2008 ruling in its entirety.
On 4 October 2004 Genentech received a subpoena from the United States Department of Justice,
requesting documents related to the promotion of Rituxan. Genentech co-operated with the government’s
associated investigation. Previously the investigation had been both civil and criminal in nature. Genentech
was informed in August 2008 by the criminal prosecutor who handled this matter that the government has
declined to prosecute Genentech criminally in connection with this investigation. The civil matter was still
ongoing. Through counsel Genentech continued to have discussions with government representatives about
the status of their investigation and Genentech’s views on this matter, including potential resolution. On
20 October 2009 the government notified Genentech that it had decided not to make any civil claim against
Genentech. The government’s investigation was initiated by a complaint that was filed under seal in the US
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in 2003 by an individual plaintiff. The complaint was
unsealed on 31 December 2009 and is currently the basis of civil litigation by the plaintiff against Roche
Holdings, Inc. and Genentech. Discovery in this matter is on-going. The Group intends to vigorously defend
itself. The outcome of this civil litigation cannot be determined at this time.
HLR, Roche Laboratories Inc. (‘RLI’) and Genentech, along with approximately 50 other brand and generic
pharmaceutical companies, have been named as defendants in several legal actions in the United States
relating to the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs and State Medicaid reimbursement. The primary allegation
in these litigations is that the pharmaceutical companies misrepresented or otherwise reported inaccurate
Average Wholesale Prices (‘AWP’) and/or Wholesale Acquisition Costs (‘WAC’) for their drugs, which
prices were allegedly relied upon by the States in calculating Medicaid reimbursements to entities such
as retail pharmacies. The States, through their respective Attorney General, are seeking repayment of the
amounts they claim were over-reimbursed. The time period associated with these cases is 1991–2005. As of
31 December 2010, HLR and RLI are defending six actions filed in the following states: Alabama, Mississippi,
New Jersey, Kansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. Genentech is defending one action filed in the state of
Kansas. Discovery is currently pending in each of these cases. HLR, RLI and Genentech intend to vigorously
defend themselves in these matters. The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.106
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
HLR, along with various other branded pharmaceutical companies, has been named as a defendant in several
legal actions in the United States brought by retail pharmacies relating to the discounting practices for Brand
Name Prescription Drugs (‘BNPD’). In these BNPD litigations, the plaintiffs allege that they were denied
discounts for certain prescription drugs that were offered to other mail order and managed care entities,
which denial is claimed to be a violation of the Robinson-Patman Act (‘RPA’). The RPA is a Federal law that
prohibits unlawful price discrimination. In addition, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants conspired in
their refusal to offer them certain discounts. The conspiracy claims against all defendants were previously
settled, with only the RPA claims remaining to be litigated. As of 31 December 2010 HLR is defending
approximately 10 BNPD actions brought by approximately 120 retail pharmacies in various federal and state
courts throughout the United States. Discovery is currently pending in each of these cases. HLR is not
currently scheduled for a trial in any of these BNPD matters in 2011. HLR intends to vigorously defend itself.
The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
On 19 November 2007 Novartis Vaccines & Diagnostics, Inc. (the former Chiron affiliate of Novartis)
filed a lawsuit against Trimeris, Inc. and four Roche Group companies: Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.,
F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Roche Laboratories Inc. and Roche Colorado Corp., in the US District Court
for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint sought an injunction and damages for the manufacture and
sale of Roche’s anti-AIDS drug Fuzeon in the United States. Novartis alleged that these activities infringed
the claims of US Patent No. 7,285,271. On 23 September 2010 the matter was settled by Roche and Trimeris
taking a royalty-bearing license under the Novartis patent.
On 8 May, 11 June, 8 August, and 29 September 2008, Genentech was named as a defendant, along with
InterMune, Inc. and its former chief executive officer, W. Scott Harkonen, in four separate class-action
complaints filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of plaintiffs who
allegedly paid part or all of the purchase price for a product that was licensed by Genentech to Connectics
Corporation and was subsequently assigned to InterMune. Genentech responded to these complaints with
a motion to dismiss these matters, which was granted on 28 April 2009. Plaintiffs filed amended complaints
including only state law claims on 28 May 2009. Genentech responded to these complaints with another
motion to dismiss, which was heard on 11 September 2009. The Court again granted Genentech’s motion
to dismiss with respect to all claims, but with leave for plaintiffs to replead specific claims under California
unfair competition law. Plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint on 23 December 2009 naming
Genentech as a defendant in claims for unfair competition law, false advertising law, consumer remedies law,
consumer protection law, and unjust enrichment. Genentech sought dismissal of this amended complaint.
On 1 September 2010 the Court entered an order granting Genentech’s motion to dismiss all claims against it
with prejudice. Plaintiffs filed an appeal of the District Court’s ruling with the United States Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit and briefing on the appeal is ongoing. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined
at this time.107
On 27 October 2008 Genentech and Biogen Idec Inc. filed a complaint against Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland
GmbH (‘Sanofi’), Sanofi-Aventis US LLC and Sanofi-Aventis US Inc. in the Northern District of California
seeking a declaratory judgement that certain Genentech products, including Rituxan, do not infringe Sanofi’s
US Patents 5,849,522 and 6,218,140 and a declaratory judgement that the ‘522 and ‘140 patents are invalid.
Also on 27 October 2008 Sanofi filed suit against Genentech and Biogen Idec in the Eastern District of Texas,
Lufkin Division, claiming that Rituxan and at least eight other Genentech products infringe the ‘522 and
‘140 patents. Sanofi brought claims for preliminary and permanent injunctions, compensatory and exemplary
damages, and other relief. Genentech challenged the venue of the Texas case and, after an opinion by the
Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, the Texas and California cases were consolidated in the Northern District
of California. The District Court issued a claim construction order on 23 June 2010. Sanofi filed a motion for
reconsideration that was denied. Genentech and Biogen Idec have filed motions for summary judgment that
Sanofi has opposed and no ruling on these motions has been issued. Discovery in these consolidated matters
is ongoing. In addition on 24 October 2008 Hoechst GmbH filed with the ICC International Court of Arbitration
(Paris) a request for arbitration with Genentech, relating to a terminated agreement between Hoechst’s
predecessors and Genentech that pertained to the above patents and related patents outside the United
States. Hoechst is seeking payments on royalties on sales of Genentech products, damages for breach of
contract, and other relief. The ICC arbitration hearing was held on 30 August 2010 through 3 September 2010.
Post-hearing briefs have been filed and a ruling is expected in the first half of 2011. The outcome of these
matters cannot be determined at this time.
On 11 May 2010 Genentech filed a patent lawsuit against the University of Pennsylvania in the US District
Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit relates to United States Patent No. 6,733,752
and seeks a declaratory judgment of patent non-infringement and invalidity with regard to that patent. On
12 July 2010 the University counterclaimed against Genentech for infringement of the ‘752 patent, seeking
unspecified damages based on the sales of Herceptin. Genentech filed its answer on 2 August 2010. A case
management conference was held on 24 August 2010 and a Markman hearing is currently scheduled for
28 March 2011. Discovery in this matter is ongoing. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at
this time.
On 27 August 2010 PDL Biopharma (‘PDL’) filed a complaint against Genentech in Nevada state court seeking
a judicial declaration concerning Genentech’s obligation to pay royalties on certain ex-US sales of Herceptin,
Avastin, Xolair and Lucentis under a 2003 agreement between the parties. On 13 September 2010 PDL filed
a first amended complaint asserting additional claims against Genentech, including breach of contract and
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. PDL also asserted new claims against Roche
and Novartis for intentional interference with contractual relations. In addition to declaratory relief, PDL is
seeking monetary damages including liquidated and punitive damages. On 1 November 2010 Genentech and
Roche filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and Roche filed an additional motion to dismiss
for lack of personal jurisdiction. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
On 20 September 2010 GSK and Genentech each filed patent lawsuits against one another (and in the case
of GSK, also against Roche Holding Ltd) in US District Courts for the District of Delaware and the Northern
District of California respectively. The lawsuits concern GSK’s US Patent Nos. RE41,070 and RE41,555. GSK
has asserted claims against Genentech and Roche alleging infringement of the ‘070 and ‘555 patents by
certain ‘therapeutic antibody products’, although the complaint only specifically refers to Herceptin. In its
lawsuit Genentech is seeking a judicial declaration of non-infringement by certain Genentech products. In the
Delaware action on 12 November 2010 Genentech filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and a
motion to transfer the case to California. Roche filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction (and
joining Genentech‘s motion in the event its personal jurisdiction motion is denied). All motions are currently
pending. In the California action on 1 December 2010 the Court entered an order staying the California action
pending resolution by the Delaware Court of Genentech‘s motion to transfer. The outcome of these matters
cannot be determined at this time.108

Fair Value Option
In 2005 the Group applied the Fair Value Option on three of its outstanding debt instruments on which the
Group had been applying fair value hedge accounting in the past. These debt instruments are the ‘European
Medium Term Note programme’ Euro bonds, the ‘Chameleon’ US dollar bonds and the ‘Rodeo’ Swiss franc
bonds. These instruments were fully redeemed at their due dates in 2008 and 2009. The Fair Value Option
treatment is based on the elimination of an accounting mismatch which had been recognised between the
hedging swaps (reported at fair value) and the hedged bonds (reported at amortised cost).
Issuance of new bonds and notes – 2010
No new bonds or notes were issued in 2010.
Issuance of new bonds and notes – 2009

Early redemption of US dollar-denominated notes | On 29 June 2010 the Group resolved to exercise
its option to call for redemption the US dollar-denominated 4.50% fixed rate notes due 1 March 2012 with
a principal of 2.5 billion US dollars. The Group redeemed these notes on 9 September 2010 at an amount
equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of these notes discounted to
the redemption date at the US Treasury rate plus 0.50%, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the
principal. The effective interest rate of these notes before the redemption was 4.84%. The cash outflow
was 2,661 million Swiss francs, plus accrued interest. The loss on redemption of 147 million Swiss francs is
recorded within financing costs (see Note 5).
On 28 December 2010 the Group resolved to exercise its option to call for redemption a portion of the US
dollar-denominated 5.00% fixed rate notes due 1 March 2014. The Group will redeem 1.0 billion US dollars
of the total principal amount of 2.75 billion US dollars of these notes on 24 March 2011 at an amount equal
to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of these notes discounted to the
redemption date at the US Treasury rate plus 0.50%, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the
principal. The US Treasury rate will be determined by an independent investment banker on the third business
day preceding the redemption. A cash outflow of approximately 1,098 million US dollars, plus accrued
interest, is expected on redemption. The Group has revised the carrying value of these notes to take into
account the changes to the amounts and timings of the estimated cash flows. The revised carrying value
of these notes at 31 December 2010 is 1,097 million US dollars (1,026 million Swiss francs). The increase in
carrying value of 103 million US dollars (108 million Swiss francs) is recorded within financing costs (see

to mitigate counterparty risk. As the fair value of the derivative instruments moved down during 2010, due
mainly to a stronger US dollar compared to the euro, a total of 1.4 billion Swiss francs cash collateral was
delivered by the Group during 2010 (2009: 1.5 billion Swiss francs delivered to the Group). This collateral
delivered in 2010 is recorded as a decrease in cash and a corresponding decrease in accrued liabilities. The
carrying value of accrued liabilities in respect of these agreements was 0.1 billion Swiss francs (31 December
2009: accrued liabilities of 1.5 billion Swiss francs). The realised loss on derivatives was 0.3 billion Swiss
francs (2009: realised gain of 1.8 billion Swiss francs) and relates mainly to hedges on the non-US dollar-
denominated bonds and notes.
Commercial paper
Genentech commercial paper program | In October 2007 Genentech established a commercial paper
program under which it could issue up to 1 billion US dollars of unsecured commercial paper notes. As at
31 December 2008 unsecured commercial paper notes with a principal amount of 500 million US dollars were
outstanding. During the first six months of 2009 the Group fully redeemed these notes at maturity at their
principal value. Genentech has terminated its commercial paper program as of 15 May 2009 and there were
no amounts outstanding at 31 December 2010.
Roche Holdings, Inc. commercial paper program | In March 2009 Roche Holdings, Inc. established
a commercial paper program under which it can issue up to 7.5 billion US dollars of unsecured commercial
paper notes guaranteed by Roche Holding Ltd. Committed credit lines of 2.5 billion euros and 950 million
US dollars are available as back-stop lines. Maturity of the notes under the program cannot exceed 365
days from the date of issuance. As at 31 December 2010 unsecured commercial paper notes with a principal
amount of 177 million US dollars and an average interest rate of 0.19% were outstanding. These amounts
were due at various dates until 7 January 2011.

a) Of amounts transferred to income statement, gains of 29 million Swiss francs were reported as ‘Royalties and other operating
income’ and losses of 1,102 million Swiss francs as ‘Financial income’.
The Group completed the purchase of the non-controlling interests in Genentech effective 26 March 2009, as
described in Note 3. Based on the revised International Accounting Standard 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate
Financial Statements’ (IAS 27), which was adopted by the Group in 2008, this transaction was accounted
for in full as an equity transaction. As a consequence, the carrying amount of the consolidated equity of the
Group was reduced by 52.2 billion Swiss francs, of which 8.5 billion Swiss francs was allocated to eliminate
the book value of Genentech non-controlling interests. This accounting effect significantly impacts the
Group’s net equity, but has no effect on the Group’s business or its dividend policy.116
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Share capital
As of 31 December 2010, the authorised and issued share capital of Roche Holding Ltd, which is the Group’s
parent company, consisted of 160,000,000 shares with a nominal value of 1.00 Swiss franc each, as in the
preceding year. The shares are bearer shares and the Group does not maintain a register of shareholders.
Based on information supplied to the Group, a shareholder group with pooled voting rights owns 50.0125%
(2009: 50.0125%) of the issued shares. This is further described in Note 33. Based on information supplied
to the Group, Novartis Ltd, Basel, and its affiliates own 33.3330% (participation below 331⁄%) of the issued
3
shares (2009: 33.3330%).
Non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
As of 31 December 2010, 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities have been authorised and were in issue
as in the preceding year. Under Swiss company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value,
are not part of the share capital and cannot be issued against a contribution which would be shown as an
asset in the balance sheet of Roche Holding Ltd. Each non-voting equity security confers the same rights
as any of the shares to participate in the net profit and any remaining proceeds from liquidation following
repayment of the nominal value of the shares and, if any, participation certificates. In accordance with the
law and the Articles of Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd, the Company is entitled at all times to exchange
all or some of the non-voting equity securities into shares or participation certificates.
Dividends
On 2 March 2010 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of 6.00 Swiss francs per share and
non-voting equity securities (2009: 5.00 Swiss francs) in respect of the 2008 business year. The distribution
to holders of outstanding shares and non-voting equity securities totalled 5,144 million Swiss francs (2009:
4,300 million Swiss francs) and has been recorded against retained earnings in 2010. The Board of Directors
has proposed dividends for the 2010 business year of 6.60 Swiss francs per share and non-voting equity
security which, if approved, would result in a total distribution to shareholders of 5,693 million Swiss francs.
This is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 1 March 2011.

29. Earnings per share and non-voting equity security
Basic earnings per share and non-voting equity security
For the calculation of basic earnings per share and non-voting equity security, the number of shares and non-
voting equity securities is reduced by the weighted average number of its own non-voting equity securities
held by the Group during the period.

Diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security, the net income and weighted
average number of shares and non-voting equity securities outstanding are adjusted for the effects of all
dilutive potential shares and non-voting equity securities.
Potential dilutive effects arise from the employee stock option plans. The exercise of outstanding vested
employee stock options would have a dilutive effect. The exercise of the outstanding vested Chugai and,
prior to the Genentech transaction, Genentech employee stock options would have a dilutive effect if the net
income of Chugai or Genentech were positive. The diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security
reflects the potential impacts of these dilutive effects on the earnings per share figures.

31. Statement of cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities arise from the Group’s primary activities in the Pharmaceuticals and
Diagnostics businesses. These are calculated by the indirect method by adjusting the Group’s operating profit
for any operating income and expenses that are not cash flows (for example depreciation, amortisation and
impairment) in order to derive the cash generated from operations. This and other operating cash flows are
shown in the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flows also include income taxes paid on all activities.

Cash flows from investing activities
Cash flows from investing activities are principally those arising from the Group’s investments in property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets, and from the acquisition and divestment of subsidiaries,
associates and businesses. Cash flows connected with the Group’s portfolio of marketable securities and
other investments are also included, as are any interest and dividend payments received in respect of these
securities and investments. These cash flows indicate the Group’s net reinvestment in its operating assets
and the cash flow effects of business combinations and divestments, as well as the cash generated by the
Group’s other investments.
Interest and dividends received | in millions of CHF
2010 2009
Interest received 57 305
Dividends received 2 1
Total 59 306121
Cash flows from financing activities
Cash flows from financing activities are primarily the proceeds from the issue and repayment of the
Group’s equity and debt instruments. They also include interest payments and dividend payments on these
instruments. Cash flows from short-term financing, including finance leases, are also included. These cash
flows indicate the Group’s transactions with the providers of its equity and debt financing. Cash flows from
short-term borrowings are shown as a net movement, as these consist of a large number of transactions
with short maturity.
Significant non-cash transactions
2010 | There were no significant non-cash transactions.
2009 | Of the total purchase consideration of 376 million US dollars for Lonza Singapore, 225 million
US dollars (238 million Swiss francs) was a non-cash settlement of loans previously made by Genentech
to Lonza. See Note 7 for further information.
32. Risk management
Group risk management
Risk management is a fundamental element of the Group’s business practice on all levels and encompasses
different types of risks. At a group level risk management is an integral part of the business planning and
controlling processes. Material risks are monitored and regularly discussed with the Corporate Executive
Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Financial risk management specifically is
described in further detail below.
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising from its underlying operations and corporate finance
activities. The Group’s financial risk exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange
rates, interest rates and equity prices as well as the creditworthiness and the solvency of the Group’s
counterparties.
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies reviewed by the boards of directors
of Roche or Chugai as appropriate to their areas of statutory responsibility. These policies cover credit
risk, liquidity risk and market risk. The policies provide guidance on risk limits, type of authorised
financial instruments and monitoring procedures. As a general principle, the policies prohibit the use of
derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Policy implementation and day-to-day
risk management are carried out by the relevant treasury functions and regular reporting on these risks
is performed by the relevant accounting and controlling functions within Roche and Chugai.122

Following the implementation of amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ that were
published in March 2009 the Group has established a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of
inputs used in making the fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy includes the following three
levels:
• Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
• Level 2 – observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
• Level 3 – unobservable inputs

At 31 December 2010 Level 1 financial assets consist of treasury bills, bonds and quoted shares. Level 2
financial assets consist primarily of commercial paper, certificates of deposit, derivative financial instruments
and unquoted shares. At 31 December 2009 Level 3 financial assets consist of auction-rate student loan
securities. These securities were valued based on broker-provided valuation models, which approximate fair
value and were sold at par value during 2010. There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2
and vice versa.124

Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations,
causing financial losses for the Group. The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses
of liquid funds deposited with or invested in such counterparties.
The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering netting
agreements and without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements, is equal to the
carrying value of the Group’s financial assets.
Trade receivables | These are subject to a policy of active credit risk management which focuses on the
assessment of country risk, credit availability, ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures.
The objective of the management of trade receivables is to sustain the growth and profitability of the Group
by optimising asset utilisation whilst maintaining risks at an acceptable level. Except as noted below, there
is no significant concentration of counterparty credit risk due to the Group’s large number of customers and
their wide geographical spread. Risk limits and exposures are continuously monitored by country and by the
nature of counterparties. Additionally, the Group obtains credit insurance and similar enhancements when
appropriate to protect the collection of trade receivables. As at 31 December 2010 no collateral was held for
loans and receivables (2009: none).
At 31 December 2010 the Group’s combined trade accounts receivable balance with three US national
wholesale distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corp., Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corp., was equivalent
to 1.1 billion Swiss francs representing 12% of the Group’s consolidated trade accounts receivable (2009:
1.3 billion Swiss francs representing 13%).

Cash and marketable securities | These are subject to a policy of restricting exposures to high-quality
counterparties and setting defined limits for individual counterparties. These limits and counterparty
credit ratings are reviewed regularly. Investments in marketable securities are entered into on the basis of
guidelines with regard to liquidity, quality and maximum amount. As a general rule, the Group invests only in
high-quality securities with adequate liquidity. Cash and short-term time deposits are subject to rules which
limit the Group’s exposure to individual financial institutions. In 2010 the Group received zero coupon Greek
government bonds in settlement of overdue receivables which have been allocated to the ‘Below BBB-range’.

Derivatives | The Group signs netting and collateral agreements under an ISDA (International Swaps
and Derivatives Association) master agreement with the respective counterparties in order to mitigate
counterparty risk on derivative positions. During 2009 the Group entered into derivative contracts with third
parties to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from bonds and notes issued by the Group’s US affiliate,
Roche Holdings, Inc. in currencies other than US dollar. The total exposure hedged at issuance of these
bonds and notes was approximately 25 billion Swiss francs (see Note 27). As the fair value of the derivative
instruments moved up during 2009 due to a weaker US dollar, net cash collateral of 1.5 billion Swiss francs
was delivered to the Group by 31 December 2009. In 2010 the Group returned 1.4 billion Swiss francs due
to the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro and pound sterling.

Since the beginning of 2010 there have been increasing financial difficulties in certain Southern European
countries, particularly Greece. The Group is a leading supplier to the Greek healthcare sector and has
trade receivables with the Greek public customers. In the second half of 2010 the Group has accepted an
offer made by the Greek government to settle large parts of overdue trade receivables with zero coupon
government bonds, redeemable between 2011 and 2013. Some first government bonds were received in late
December 2010. The Group expects to receive the remaining government bonds during the first half of 2011.
The Group is carefully monitoring the situation and is assessing its options to manage these counterparty
exposures.
As at 31 December 2010 there are no other financial assets whose terms have been renegotiated
(2009: none).126
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in
time. The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet
its liquidity requirements at any point in time. Group liquidity is reported to senior management on a monthly
basis.
Roche and Chugai enjoy strong credit quality and are rated by at least one major credit rating agency.
The ratings will permit efficient access to the international capital markets in the event of major financing
requirements. In addition, the Group has unused committed credit lines with various financial institutions
totalling 4.5 billion Swiss francs (2009: 5.1 billion Swiss francs). The decline in undiscounted financial
liabilities, shown in the table below, is mainly due to debt repayments, interest paid as well as currency
translation effects from a stronger Swiss franc against the euro, US dollar and pound sterling.

Market risk
Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities. Market
risk may affect the Group financial result and the value of Group equity.
The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to measure the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. Roche
has defined VaR limits to manage market risk. VaR data are reported on a monthly basis and indicate the
value range within which a given financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of
movements in market prices. VaR is a statistical measure which implicitly assumes that value changes of the
recent past are indicative of value changes in the future. VaR figures do not represent actual or expected
losses, or possible worst-case losses over the stated period.127
VaR figures are calculated using a historical simulation approach. For each scenario, all financial instruments
are fully valued and the total change in value and earnings is determined. All VaR calculations are based on
a 95% confidence level and a holding period of 20 trading days over the past ten years. This holding period
reflects the time required to change the corresponding risk exposure, should this be deemed appropriate.
Longer holding periods increase the probability of higher value changes and lead to increased VaR figures.
Actual future gains and losses associated with our treasury activities may differ materially from the VaR
analyses performed due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of
changes to interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and equity investment prices, particularly in
periods of high market volatilities. Furthermore, the VaR numbers below do not include the effect of changes
in credit spreads.

VaR – Interest rate component 466 717
VaR – Other price component 34 57
Diversification (77) (98)
VaR – Total market risk 467 719
At 31 December 2010 the total VaR of the financial assets and liabilities was 467 million Swiss francs
(31 December 2009: 719 million Swiss francs). The interest rate VaR decreased to 466 million Swiss francs
reflecting the ageing of debt, the repayment of debt during 2010 and a higher duration of fixed income assets
held. As all issued debt is held at amortised cost, the interest rate VaR is a sole metric for economic fair value
changes, but there is no impact on the carrying value or profit and loss of the Group. The foreign exchange
VaR remained stable. Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities and
declined as equity securities holdings were reduced. At 31 December 2010 the Group held equity securities
with a market value of 0.5 billion Swiss francs (31 December 2009: 0.6 billion Swiss francs). This includes
holdings in biotechnology companies, which were acquired in the context of licensing transactions or
scientific collaborations.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates across the world and is exposed to movements in foreign currencies affecting the Group
financial result and the value of Group’s equity. Foreign exchange risk arises because the amount of local
currency paid or received for transactions denominated in foreign currencies may vary due to changes in
exchange rates (‘transaction exposures’) and because the foreign currency denominated financial statements
of the Group’s foreign subsidiaries may vary upon consolidation into the Swiss franc-denominated Group
Financial Statements (‘translation exposures’).
The objective of the Group’s foreign exchange risk management activities is to preserve the economic value
of its current and future assets and to minimise the volatility of the Group’s financial result. The primary
focus of the Group’s foreign exchange risk management activities is on hedging transaction exposures
arising through foreign currency flows or monetary positions held in foreign currencies. The Group does
not currently hedge translation exposures using financial instruments.
The Group monitors transaction exposures on a daily basis. The net foreign exchange result and the
corresponding VaR parameters are reported on a monthly basis. The Group uses forward contracts,
foreign exchange options and cross-currency swaps to hedge transaction exposures. Application of these
instruments intends to continuously lock in favourable developments of foreign exchange rates, thereby
reducing the exposure to potential future movements in such rates.128
Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could affect the Group financial result or
the value of Group equity. Changes in interest rates may cause variations in interest income and expense.
In addition, they may affect the market value of certain financial assets, liabilities and hedging instruments.
The primary objective of the Group’s interest rate management is to protect the net interest result.
Interest rate exposures and the corresponding VaR parameters are reported on a monthly basis. The Group
uses forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge its interest rate exposures. Depending on the interest
rate environment of major currencies, the Group will use these instruments to generate the appropriate mix
of fixed and floating rate exposures.
Other price risk
Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities. At 31 December 2010 the
Group held equity securities with a market value of 0.5 billion Swiss francs (2009: 0.6 billion Swiss francs).
This amount includes holdings in biotechnology companies, which were acquired in the context of licensing
transactions or scientific collaborations. Due to the nature of their business, biotechnology companies are
exposed to greater equity volatilities than general stock market fluctuations.
The Group manages the price risk through placing limits on individual and total equity investments. These
limits are defined both as a percentage of total liquid funds and as an absolute number for individual equity
investments. Equity price risk is reported as a VaR figure on a monthly basis to senior management.
Impairment of financial assets
In 2010 and 2009 impairments of loans and receivables were mainly due to an increase in the expected
non-recoverability of trade receivables (see also Note 18).

Capital
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total capitalisation, being the sum of debt plus
equity, including non-controlling interests. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide benefits
for patients and returns to investors.
• To provide an adequate return to investors based on the level of risk undertaken.
• To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver
future benefits for patients and returns to investors.
• To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The Group completed the purchase of the non-controlling interests in Genentech effective 26 March 2009, as
described in Note 3. Based on the revised International Accounting Standard 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate
Financial Statements’ (IAS 27), which was adopted by the Group in 2008, this transaction was accounted
for in full as an equity transaction. As a consequence, the carrying amount of the consolidated equity of the
Group was reduced by 52.2 billion Swiss francs, of which 8.5 billion Swiss francs was allocated to eliminate
the book value of Genentech non-controlling interests. This accounting effect significantly impacts the
Group’s net equity, but has no effect on the Group’s business or its dividend policy.129
Capital is monitored on the basis of the capitalisation, which is calculated as being debt plus equity (including
non-controlling interests). This is reported to senior management as part of the Group’s regular internal
management reporting. The Group’s capitalisation is shown in the table below.

The Group is not subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements as known in the financial services
industry.
The Group has a majority shareholding in Chugai (see Note 4). Chugai is a public company and its objectives,
policies and processes for managing its own capital are determined by local management.

Roche Group – Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Roche Finance Report 2010
Report of Roche Management on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate control over financial reporting. The internal control system was designed to provide
reasonable assurance over the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of
consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those
systems determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting as of
31 December 2010 based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described
in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the system
of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 31 December 2010.
The Statutory Auditor KPMG AG have audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for
the year ended 31 December 2010, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and with the International
Standards on Auditing (ISA). They have also issued a report on the effectiveness of the Group’s system of
internal control over financial reporting. This report is set out on pages 138 to 139.

Report of the Statutory Auditor on the
Consolidated Financial Statements
Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Consolidated Financial Statements
to the Annual General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
As statutory auditor, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding
Ltd, which comprise the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement
of cash flows, statement of changes in equity and notes on pages 34 to 134 for the year ended 31 December
2010.
Board of Directors’ Responsibility | The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair
presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) and the requirements of Swiss law. This responsibility includes designing, implementing
and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board
of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making
accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s Responsibility | Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, Swiss Auditing
Standards and International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material
misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system
relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion | In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 give
a true and fair view of the financial position, the results of operations and the cash flows in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law.137
Report on Other Legal Requirements
We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA)
and independence (article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with
our independence.
In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that
an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial
statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.
We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Report of the Independent Auditor on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of the Independent Auditor on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of the Independent Auditor on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
to the Annual General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
We have examined the Roche Group’s system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December
2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting as included in the accompanying Report of Roche Management on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our examination. An entity’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process effected by the entity’s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial statements prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial
reporting framework; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection
of the unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a material effect
on the entity’s financial statements.
We conducted our examination in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements
3000 (ISAE 3000). This standard requires that we plan and perform our examination to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our examination included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of
management override of controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also,
projections of any evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the
risk that internal control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.139
In our opinion, the Roche Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control, over financial
reporting as of 31 December 2010 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and International Standards on Auditing,
the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended 31 December 2010 and our
report dated 27 January 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Roche Finance Report 2010 Roche Group – Multi-Year Overview and Supplementary Information
Core results and EPS Information
The Group’s basic and diluted earnings per share information is given in Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages 117 to 118. The Group has expanded the presentation of its core results for 2010.
Previously only core EPS was shown, but now the full income statement for the Group and the operating
results of the divisions are shown on both an IFRS and core basis. This allows a transparent assessment
of both the actual results and the underlying performance of the business.
The core results concept, which is used in the internal management of the business, is based on the IFRS
results, with the following adjustments:
• Global restructuring costs (see Note 8) are excluded.
• Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (see Note 14) are excluded.
• Acquisition accounting and other one-time impacts from Alliance arrangements and Business
Combinations (see Financial Review) are excluded.
• Discontinued operations (currently none) would be excluded.
• Legal and environment expenses (see Financial Review) are excluded.
• The tax benefit recorded under IFRS in respect of Equity Compensation Plans (ECPs), which varies
according to price of the underlying equity, is replaced by a normalised tax benefit, being the IFRS 2
expense multiplied by the applicable tax rate (see Note 6).
• Material one-time treasury items such as major debt restructurings or settlement of pension plans
(both currently none) would be excluded.
• Global issues outside healthcare sector beyond the Group’s control (currently none) would be excluded.
The core results concept was further described on 22 October 2010 at an Investor Update teleconference,
which is available for download at: http://www.roche.com/investors/ir_agenda/csr_151010.htm
The Group’s IFRS results, including the divisional breakdown, are reconciled to the core results in the tables
below. The calculation of core EPS is also given in the tables below. To avoid double-counting, amounts shown
for ‘Global Restructuring’ below exclude items in 2010 from the Operational Excellence programme that are
included in the other adjustment columns: these are impairment of intangible assets totalling 424 million Swiss
francs (see Note 8). Additional commentary to the adjustment items is given in the Financial Review.145

Special Stock Awards | During 2009 the Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate
Executive Committee were granted a total of 96,750 Special Stock Awards. The Chairman of the Board of
Directors received 34,084 awards and members of the CEC received a total of 62,666 awards, of which
20,450 awards were granted to Dr Schwan. The fair value of these awards for the employee is calculated
based on the fair value of non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine) at the grant date (CHF 146.70 or CHF
169.40) discounted to take into account the period in which they are blocked (3 years: 83.962%, 10 years:
55.839%). There were no such awards in 2010.
Employer contribution to social security schemes and pension plans | The Group pays social insurance
contributions in respect of the above remuneration and pays contributions to pension and other post-
employment benefit plans for the Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate Executive
Committee.
Equity Compensation Plans | The Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate
Executive Committee also participate in certain equity compensation plans as described below. The terms
and vesting conditions of these awards are disclosed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The fair values used in the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the cost to the company at grant date
and reflect amongst other matters the observed exercise behaviour and exit rate for the whole population
that receive the awards and initial simulations of any performance conditions. For the purposes of these
remuneration disclosures the values are calculated based on the fair value that the employee receives taking
into account the preliminary assessment of any completed performance conditions.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate Executive Committee are eligible to
participate in Roche Connect, a programme that enables employees to make regular deductions from their
salaries to purchase non-voting equity securities. The Group contributes to the programme, which allows the
employees to purchase non-voting equity securities at a discount (usually 20%).
During 2010 members of the Corporate Executive Committee were granted 451,755 Stock-settled Stock
Appreciation Rights (S-SARs). The individual awards relating to 2010 are shown in the table below. The fair
value of these awards for the employee is 23.05 Swiss francs, which is calculated using the Black-Scholes
formula, assuming holding until maturity, and deducting 11% for the average two-year vesting period.157
Members of the Corporate Executive Committee and other members of senior management participate in
the Roche Performance Share Plan (PSP). The Group has three overlapping three-year PSPs. The target
awards for the three-year cycle are defined at the beginning of the cycle and the awards are considered
to form part of the employee’s remuneration in three equal annual amounts over the three-year cycle. Each
award will result in between zero and two non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine), depending upon
the achievement of the performance targets, and the discretion of the Board of Directors. The individual
awards relating to 2010 are shown in the table below. The number of the awards is calculated as follows:
• PSP 2008–2010: At the end of the cycle the performance targets were not achieved and accordingly
the participants received none of the originally targeted non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine).
• PSP 2009–2011: One non-voting equity security (Genussschein) per award.
• PSP 2010–2012: One non-voting equity security (Genussschein) per award.
• The resulting allocations are multiplied by the non-voting equity security (Genussschein) price at
31 December 2010 of 137.00 Swiss francs to give the fair value for the remuneration received by the
employee.

In 2009 the total remuneration of the Corporate Executive Committee from equity compensation plans
was 16 million Swiss francs, of which 4 million Swiss francs were attributable to Dr Schwan, the member of
the Corporate Executive Committee with the highest total remuneration.
Other employee benefits | This includes tax advisory costs and other incidental benefits. In 2009 this
also includes remuneration of Dr Schwan, Dr Hunziker, Mr Burns and Prof. Knowles for serving on the Chugai
Board of Directors and a special payment to Dr Keller of 50,000 Swiss francs for his 25 years’ service to
the Group.
Transactions with former members of the Corporate Executive Committee | Pensions and tax consulting
services totalling 2 million Swiss francs were paid by the Group in 2010 to four former Corporate Executive
Committee members (2009: 2 million Swiss francs to two former members).
7. Board and Executive shareholdings

Report of the Statutory Auditor
on the Financial Statements
Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Financial Statements
to the Annual General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
As statutory auditor, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd,
which comprise the income statement, balance sheet and notes on pages 151 to 161 for the year ended
31 December 2010.
Board of Directors’ Responsibility | The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Swiss law and the company’s articles of
incorporation. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system
relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting
policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s Responsibility | Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial
statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation
of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control system.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness
of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.
Opinion | In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 comply with Swiss
law and the company’s articles of incorporation.163
Report on Other Legal Requirements
We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA)
and independence (article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with
our independence.
In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an
internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according
to the instructions of the Board of Directors.
We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and
the company’s articles of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be
approved.

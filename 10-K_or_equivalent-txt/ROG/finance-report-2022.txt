CER (Constant Exchange Rates): The percentage changes at constant exchange rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the 2022 and 2021 results at
constant exchange rates (the average rates for the year ended 31 December 2021). For the definition of CER see page 171.
Core results and Core EPS (earnings per share): These exclude non-core items such as global restructuring plans and amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible
assets. This allows an assessment of both the actual results and the underlying performance of the business. A full income statement for the Group and the operating results
of the divisions are shown on both an IFRS and core basis. The core concept is fully described on pages 164–167 and reconciliations between the IFRS and core results are
given there.
Free cash flow is used to assess the Group’s ability to generate the cash required to conduct and maintain its operations. It also indicates the Group’s ability to generate cash
to finance dividend payments, repay debt and to undertake merger and acquisition activities. The free cash flow concept is used in the internal management of the business.

Finance – 2022 in Brief
Roche in 2022
The Roche Group reported good overall results in 2022. Sales grew by 2% at constant exchange rates (CER). IFRS net income
decreased by 6% (CER) and core earnings per share increased by 5% (CER). The appreciation of the Swiss franc had an adverse
impact on the results expressed in Swiss francs.
Sales
Group sales increased by 2% (CER) to CHF 63.3 billion (1% increase in CHF terms). Pharmaceuticals sales increased by 2% (CER)
driven by the growing demand for newer medicines, including Ocrevus, Hemlibra, Vabysmo, Evrysdi and Tecentriq. Diagnostics sales
showed growth of 3% (CER), with growth in routine testing more than compensating for lower sales of COVID-19-related products.
Operating results
Core operating profit increased by 3% (CER) to CHF 22.2 billion (1% increase in CHF terms). Research and development
expenditure grew by 3% (CER) to CHF 14.1 billion on a core basis, with oncology remaining the primary area and the cancer
immunotherapy portfolio being a key driver. Neuroscience, immunology and ophthalmology also represented significant areas of
spending in the Pharmaceuticals Division. Research and development costs represented 22.2% of Group sales. IFRS operating
results were 1% lower (CER) and included non-core expenses of CHF 2.8 billion for intangible asset impairment charges in the
Pharmaceuticals Division.
Non-operating results
Financing costs (IFRS) increased by 56% at CER to CHF 0.7 billion due to the issuance of debt in December 2021, February, March
and September 2022 as well as an increase in interest rates. Income tax expenses (IFRS) increased by 19% at CER to CHF 2.8 billion.
The effective core tax rate for 2022 increased to 16.4% mainly due to the impact from the resolution of several tax disputes which
reduced the Group’s effective core tax rate by 1.5 percentage points in 2022 compared to 3.3 percentage points in 2021.
Net income
IFRS net income was CHF 13.5 billion, a decrease of 6% at CER (decrease of 9% in CHF terms). This decrease is due to higher
impairment of intangible assets and higher interest costs and income taxes. Core earnings per share increased by 5% at CER
to CHF 20.30 (+2% in CHF terms). The repurchase of shares from Novartis and the consequent additional financing costs had an
accretive effect, net of tax, of approximately 4 percentage points on IFRS EPS and approximately 5 percentage points on Core EPS.
Cash flows
Operating free cash flow remained strong at CHF 17.7 billion. The decrease of 8% at CER (decrease of 9% in CHF terms) was due to
increased net working capital. Free cash flow decreased by 16% at CER (decrease of 17% in CHF terms) to CHF 13.0 billion, driven by
lower operating free cash flow and the higher tax payments.
Financial position
Net working capital increased driven by higher trade receivables in the Pharmaceuticals Division and higher inventories for
both divisions. Net debt decreased by CHF 2.6 billion to CHF 15.6 billion as the free cash flow exceeded the dividend payments.
Credit ratings remained strong: AA by Standard & Poor’s, Aa2 by Moody’s and AA by Fitch.
Shareholder return
A proposal will be made to increase dividends by 2% to CHF 9.50 per share and non-voting equity security. This would
represent the 36th consecutive year of dividend growth and would result in a pay-out ratio of 46.8%, subject to AGM approval.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) was minus 19.6% representing the combined performance of share and non-voting equity
security. The development of the Roche share price during 2022 was influenced by negative news flow on the research and
development pipeline and an expected decline in COVID-19-related sales.2 Roche Group Finance Report 2022

In 2022 the Roche Group achieved sales growth of 2% at constant exchange rates (CER) and core operating profit growth of
3%. IFRS net income decreased by 6% (CER) while Core EPS increased by 5% (CER). There was an adverse impact on the results
expressed in Swiss francs compared to constant exchange rates of 1 percentage point on sales, 2 percentage points on core
operating profit and 3 percentage points on IFRS net income and Core EPS.
In the Pharmaceuticals Division sales were higher by 2% due to the continuing uptake of newer medicines despite the negative
impact from biosimilar competition and lower sales of Actemra/RoActemra for COVID-19. In the Diagnostics Division growth
in routine testing of 7% more than compensated for a drop in demand for COVID-19-related products. The core operating profit
growth of 3% reflected the sales growth and also the income from the Ultomiris patent settlement, offset by lower Ronapreve
profit-share income from Regeneron.
IFRS net income decreased by 6% and Core EPS increased by 5%. The IFRS net income includes impairments of intangible
assets of CHF 2.8 billion which were driven by reduced sales expectations and the latest research data. The Core EPS increase
included a positive impact of approximately 5 percentage points from the share repurchase from Novartis, net of additional
financing costs and tax. The Ultomiris patent settlement had a positive impact of approximately 2 percentage points on Core
EPS, while the lower Ronapreve profit-share income had a negative impact of approximately 3 percentage points on Core EPS,
both net of tax.
Operating free cash flow remained strong at CHF 17.7 billion. The decrease of 8% was due to increased net working capital.
The free cash flow was CHF 13.0 billion, a decrease of 16%, as a result of the lower operating free cash flow and higher tax
payments.4 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2022

Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division were CHF 45.6 billion (2021: CHF 45.0 billion), an increase of 2% at CER, driven by growing
demand for Ocrevus, Hemlibra, Vabysmo, Evrysdi and Tecentriq, which together contributed an additional CHF 3.2 billion (CER)
of sales. Sales of MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin decreased by a combined CHF 1.9 billion (CER), as the impact of
biosimilar competition continued, but at a lower rate than in previous years. COVID-19-related sales declined due to sales of
Actemra/RoActemra being 22% lower, while for Ronapreve higher sales in Japan compensated for lower sales in Europe.
The Diagnostics Division reported sales of CHF 17.7 billion, an increase of 3% at CER. The sales growth was driven by increased
routine testing across all regions, partly offset by lower sales from COVID-19-related products. Sales in the division’s base
business increased by 7% at CER, with the immunodiagnostics business being the main growth driver. Total sales of COVID-19-
related tests, notably the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen tests, were 10% (CER) lower at CHF 4.1 billion (2021: CHF 4.7 billion).
The Pharmaceuticals Division’s core operating profit increased by 5% (CER), above the sales increase of 2%. The CHF 0.7 billion
of income from the Ultomiris patent settlement was largely offset by a reduction of CHF 0.6 billion from Ronapreve profit-share
income from Regeneron. Cost of sales decreased by 2% mainly due to lower manufacturing costs, driven by higher costs in 2021
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There was also a favourable product mix impact in 2022. Marketing and distribution
costs increased by 2% driven by higher spending on digital customer solutions and on launch and pre-launch activities. Research
and development costs were CHF 12.1 billion, with oncology remaining the primary area and the cancer immunotherapy portfolio
being a key driver. Neuroscience, immunology and ophthalmology also represented significant areas of spending. The increase of
1% in research and development costs was driven by investments in gene therapy, Chugai and early research and development.Finance Report 2022 Financial Review | Roche Group 5
In the Diagnostics Division core operating profit decreased by 5% (CER) to CHF 3.6 billion, despite the sales growth of 3%.
Cost of sales increased by 4%, ahead of the sales growth, because of an unfavourable product mix impact from COVID-19-
related tests and higher costs for freight. Marketing and distribution expenses increased by 1% at CER as a result of higher
distribution costs related to SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen tests, partly offset by lower personnel expenses. Research and
development costs increased by 12%, with digital solutions being the main growth driver. In addition, investments continued
for projects in sequencing, cardiac disease and mass spectrometry.
The IFRS operating profit decreased by 2% (CER) in the Pharmaceuticals Division, in contrast to the 5% growth in core operating
profit, because of higher intangible assets impairment. In the Diagnostics Division, IFRS operating profit increased by 5% (CER)
due to the base effect of the significant spending on restructuring activities in 2021. The 2022 results for the Group include
CHF 2.8 billion for the impairment of intangible assets, CHF 0.9 billion for intangible asset amortisation and CHF 1.0 billion of
expenses from global restructuring plans.
Financing core costs increased by 64% (CER) to CHF 0.7 billion due to the additional interest expense from the new debt issued
to finance the share repurchase from Novartis and also increases in interest rates which affected short-term borrowing costs.
Other financial income (expense) contributed CHF 0.2 billion less on a core basis due to higher net foreign exchange losses
and higher losses on the net monetary position in hyperinflationary economies in Argentina and Türkiye. The Group’s effective
core tax rate increased to 16.4% compared to 14.5% in 2021. The increase was mainly due to the impact from the resolution
of several tax disputes which reduced the Group’s effective core tax rate by 1.5 percentage points in 2022 compared to
3.3 percentage points in 2021.
Net income decreased by 6% (CER) on an IFRS basis to CHF 13.5 billion and decreased by 1% (CER) on a core basis to
CHF 17.5 billion. The amount of net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased by 20% on an IFRS basis, and
by 19% on a core basis, due to the impact of the Ultomiris patent settlement at Chugai.
Operating free cash flow was CHF 17.7 billion, a decrease of 8% at CER, due to the increase in net working capital. The free
cash flow of CHF 13.0 billion, a decrease of 16% at CER, was a result of the lower operating free cash flow and the higher tax
payments.6 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2022

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
In the Pharmaceuticals Division Actemra/RoActemra has received US FDA approval for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalised
adults and retains Emergency Use Authorization for children aged between 2 and 18. Sales in 2022 were CHF 2.7 billion, a decline
of 22% at CER due to lower demand from such patients. Sales of Ronapreve, a neutralising antibody combination developed with
Regeneron, were CHF 1.7 billion, with higher sales in Japan offsetting lower sales in Europe. There was a decline of CHF 0.6 billion
in profit-share income from Regeneron relating to US sales of Ronapreve. The Diagnostics Division’s portfolio of COVID-19 tests,
notably the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test, generated sales of CHF 4.1 billion (2021: CHF 4.7 billion), a decline of 10% at CER due
to the lower demand for COVID-19-related products.
Competition from biosimilar and generic medicines
The Group’s pharmaceutical products are generally protected by patent rights, which are intended to provide the Group with
exclusive marketing rights in various countries. However, patent rights are of varying scope and duration, and the Group may
be required to enter into costly litigation to enforce its patent and other intellectual property rights. Loss of market exclusivity
for one or more major products – either due to patent expiration, challenges from generic medicines, biosimilars and non-
comparable biologics or other reasons – could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations
or financial condition. The introduction of a generic, biosimilar or non-comparable biologic version of the same or a similar
medicine usually results in a significant reduction in net sales for the relevant product, as other manufacturers typically offer
their versions at lower prices.
Patents and their expiry are, and always have been, an integral part of the Group’s business model and future growth will remain
driven by innovation. The latest information from clinical studies is included in the Annual Report and details of the Group’s
product development portfolio are available for download at:
http://www.roche.com/research_and_development/who_we_are_how_we_work/pipeline.htm
MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin. The Group’s basic, primary patents for these three products have expired
worldwide. The in-licensed Halozyme patent rights for subcutaneous formulations of MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin begin
to expire in 2024. Sales, including regional breakdowns, for MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin are disclosed in the
Pharmaceuticals Division’s operating results and are summarised in the table below. The year-on-year movements were also
driven by regular price and volume changes. Biosimilar competition is only one factor in the overall picture.

Total sales 6,339 8,315 –23 13.9 18.5
The first biosimilar versions of Herceptin and Avastin were launched in the US from mid-2019 and the first biosimilar versions
of MabThera/Rituxan in late 2019. In Europe the first biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin were launched from
mid-2017 and from mid-2018, respectively, and are now marketed in most EU countries. The first biosimilar versions of Avastin
came to market in Europe from mid-2020. The first biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin were launched in Japan
in 2018. Biosimilar versions of Avastin were launched in late 2019 in the colorectal cancer indication, in 2020 in the non-small
cell lung cancer indication and in 2022 in the breast cancer indication. Sales of these three products in Japan were impacted
by government price cuts as well as biosimilar competition. In the International region, biosimilar versions of all three products
have been launched in many countries and this, together with the impacts of regular price and volume changes, has led to the
decline in sales.
Lucentis. The Group’s basic, primary patents have expired in the US. The first biosimilar version of Lucentis with a restricted
label has come to market in the US at the beginning of the third quarter of 2022. US sales of Lucentis were CHF 1,012 million
(2021: CHF 1,353 million), a decline of 28% at CER (as reported in US dollars) due to competitive pressure.
Esbriet. Following a negative decision from the US District Court for the District of Delaware in March 2022, the first
generic versions of Esbriet came to market in the US in the second quarter of 2022. US sales of Esbriet were CHF 455 million
(2021: CHF 732 million), a decline of 41% at CER (as reported in US dollars).8 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2022
Actemra/RoActemra. The Group’s basic, primary patents have expired in the US and EU. Based on publicly available information
from competitor companies, the Group currently anticipates that the first biosimilar versions of Actemra/RoActemra could
come to market in the US and the EU in the second half of 2023. Global sales of Actemra/RoActemra were CHF 2,701 million
(2021: CHF 3,562 million), a decline of 22% at CER, driven by lower demand from hospitalised patients with COVID-19.
Mergers and acquisitions
Asset acquisitions. On 26 September 2022 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Good Therapeutics, Inc.
(‘Good Therapeutics’), a privately owned US company based in Seattle, Washington. With the acquisition, the Group gained
access to Good Therapeutics’ PD-1-regulated IL-2 programme. Good Therapeutics is reported in the Pharmaceuticals Division.
The cash consideration paid at the acquisition date was USD 0.2 billion. Additional contingent payments may be made based
upon the achievement of performance-related milestones. This transaction did not qualify as business combination under
IFRS 3 and has been accounted for as addition to intangible assets.
Further details are given in Note 6 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Alliance transactions
In 2022 in-licensing and alliance transactions resulted in intangible assets of CHF 0.9 billion (2021: CHF 1.0 billion) being
recognised.
Global restructuring plans
During 2022 the Pharmaceuticals Division initiated a portfolio prioritisation programme and the Group continued the
implementation of various global restructuring plans initiated in prior years.
Global restructuring plans: costs incurred in millions of CHF
2022 2021
Global restructuring costs
– Employee-related costs 127 876
– Site closure costs 323 276
– Divestment of products and businesses 0 0
– Other reorganisation expenses 519 210
Total global restructuring costs 969 1,362
The business process transformation to simplify system landscapes and streamline process complexity incurred
employee-related costs of CHF 135 million (2021: CHF 85 million) and other reorganisation expenses of CHF 198 million
(2021: CHF 116 million). The transformation is a multi-year cross-divisional programme to drive efficiency gains.
The manufacturing network strategy review in the Pharmaceuticals Division incurred site closure costs of CHF 178 million
(2021: CHF 18 million) related to sites in the US, Switzerland and Germany. Additionally, the Pharmaceuticals Division’s portfolio
prioritisation programme incurred costs of CHF 221 million (2021: none) mainly related to the closure of studies.
In 2021 the major items of global restructuring costs were for employee-related costs from business transformation initiatives
in the Pharmaceuticals Division, strategy plans in the Diagnostics Division, notably in Diabetes Care, and site development at the
Basel/Kaiseraugst site in Switzerland.
Further details are given in Note 7 to the Annual Financial Statements.Finance Report 2022 Financial Review | Roche Group 9
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Pharmaceuticals Division. The Pharmaceuticals Division recorded impairment charges to intangible assets of CHF 2.8 billion
which were driven by reduced sales expectations and the latest research data. The major items were a charge of CHF 0.7 billion
for the impairment of the in-licensed Gavreto intangible assets and a charge of CHF 0.5 billion for the partial impairment
of the intangible asset SPK-8011, a novel gene therapy for the treatment of haemophilia A that was acquired as part of the
Spark Therapeutics acquisition. There were also impairment charges of CHF 0.4 billion for PRM-151, a novel anti-fibrotic
immunomodulator for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis that was acquired as part of the Promedior acquisition,
CHF 0.3 billion for Flatiron’s technology and CHF 0.3 billion for Rozlytrek, acquired as part of the Ignyta acquisition.
Diagnostics Division. There were no impairments of goodwill or intangible assets.
In 2021 there were impairment charges of CHF 0.7 billion in the Pharmaceuticals Division and none in the Diagnostics Division.
Further details are given in Notes 9 and 10 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Legal and environmental cases
There were no significant developments in 2022. Further details are given in Note 20 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Share repurchase
On 6 December 2021, the Roche Group repurchased 53.3 million Roche shares held by Novartis for a total consideration of
CHF 19.0 billion. The repurchased shares were reported as treasury shares as at 31 December 2021. Upon the cancellation
of these shares in February 2022 the share capital of Roche Holding Ltd, which is the Group’s parent company, decreased by
CHF 53.3 million from CHF 160.0 million to CHF 106.7 million. The CHF 19.0 billion bridge loan facility drawn in 2021 to finance
the share repurchase was fully repaid by May 2022, partly from the proceeds from new debt issuances and partly from internal
cash generation. Further details are given in Notes 21 and 22 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Net income and earnings per share
IFRS net income decreased by 6% while Core EPS increased by 5%. The repurchase of shares from Novartis and the
consequent additional financing costs had an accretive effect, net of tax, of approximately 4 percentage points on IFRS EPS
and approximately 5 percentage points on Core EPS. The Ultomiris patent settlement had an accretive impact, net of tax, of
approximately 2 percentage points on Core EPS, while the reduction in Ronapreve profit-share income had a dilutive impact,
net of tax, of approximately 3 percentage points on Core EPS. The core basis excludes non-core items such as global restructuring
costs, amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and mergers and acquisitions and alliance transactions.
The amount of net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased by 20% on an IFRS basis, and by 19% on a core basis,
due to the impact of the Ultomiris patent settlement at Chugai.

Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc appreciated significantly against the Japanese yen and also against the euro,
which had a negative translation effect on the Group’s net operating assets. The exchange rates used are given on page 31.
Net working capital increased in both divisions. In the Pharmaceuticals Division, net working capital was higher by 75% at CER
mainly due to the increase in trade receivables driven by Ronapreve sales in Japan in December 2022 as well as the increase
in inventories to ensure supply resilience, notably for Actemra/RoActemra and the ramp-up of launch products with Vabysmo
and Phesgo being the main drivers. In the Diagnostics Division, net working capital was higher by 14% at CER, driven by
higher inventories, which increased by 15% to support growth in the division’s base business and due to the increased inbound
shipments of instruments towards the end of year.
The decrease in net debt was due to the free cash flow of CHF 13.0 billion partly offset by the dividend payments of CHF 7.8 billion.
The CHF 19.0 billion bridge loan facility drawn in 2021 to finance the share repurchase from Novartis was fully repaid by
May 2022, partly from the proceeds from the new debt issuances and partly from internal cash generation. Lease liabilities
decreased to CHF 1.2 billion due to the regular payments. The net pension liability was 19% lower at CER following increases in
discount rates. The net asset position for income taxes increased mainly due to taxes paid exceeding the income tax expenses,
partially offset by the deferred tax effects of the pension and equity compensation plans.

The Group’s operating free cash flow for 2022 was CHF 17.7 billion, a decrease of 8% at CER. This was due to increased net
working capital, in particular for trade receivables in the Pharmaceuticals Division and inventories in both divisions. The free
cash flow of CHF 13.0 billion, a decrease of 16% at CER, was a result of the lower operating free cash flow, higher short-term
borrowing costs due to increased interest rates and higher tax payments, notably in the US and Japan.Finance Report 2022 Financial Review | Roche Group 11

Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division were CHF 45.6 billion (2021: CHF 45.0 billion), an increase of 2% at CER. There was
continued growing demand for Ocrevus, Hemlibra, Vabysmo, Evrysdi and Tecentriq, which together contributed an additional
CHF 3.2 billion (CER) of sales. The demand for Ocrevus remained strong in both indications, with a sales increase of 17% to
CHF 6.0 billion. Hemlibra continued to show a significant uptake, with sales reaching CHF 3.8 billion, an increase of 27%.
Vabysmo was approved in the US in January 2022 and showed a high initial uptake with sales of CHF 0.6 billion. Evrysdi sales
continued to show a strong uptake across all regions, driven by Europe and the International region, with a sales growth of 87%.
Tecentriq sales grew by 14% to CHF 3.7 billion, driven by the US and Europe.
Sales in the oncology therapeutic area decreased by 1% at CER, due to the biosimilar competition for MabThera/Rituxan,
Herceptin and Avastin, partially compensated by the growth of Tecentriq, Phesgo, Polivy, Alecensa, Perjeta and Kadcyla.
Tecentriq sales grew mostly due to higher demand in the US and France. Phesgo continued to show a considerable uptake
predominantly in Europe and in the US, with total sales of CHF 0.7 billion. Sales of Alecensa grew across all regions, with China
and the US being the main drivers. Kadcyla showed growth primarily in the International region followed by Europe. Sales growth
was driven by the usage of Kadcyla in the early breast cancer setting. Perjeta sales grew, notably in the International region with
higher demand in China in both early and metastatic breast cancer settings. This was partly offset by a decline in Perjeta sales
in Europe following the launch of Phesgo in 2020.
Sales in neuroscience grew by 23% at CER mainly due to Ocrevus. Evrysdi was also a growth driver, with sales of CHF 1.1 billion
following a high uptake in Europe and the International region. Sales in immunology decreased by 14%, following a decrease in
Actemra/RoActemra sales of 22% due to lower demand from hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Sales of Esbriet were 31%
lower as a result of generic competition in the US. These declines in immunology sales were partly offset by higher sales of Xolair
in the US driven by steady growth in the chronic spontaneous urticaria indication. Within the Infectious diseases therapeutic
area, sales for Ronapreve increased due to higher sales in Japan whereas sales for Rocephin declined mainly in China. Sales in
ophthalmology increased by 14% driven by the initial uptake of Vabysmo, partially compensated by the fall in Lucentis sales of
28% in the US due to competitive pressure. In other therapeutic areas, sales of Activase/TNKase were 14% lower, mainly due to
the unwinding of temporary stockpiling in the US by distributors and customers at the end of 2021.Finance Report 2022 Financial Review | Roche Group 13

Sales in the HER2 franchise increased by 3% to CHF 9.0 billion. Sales of Perjeta grew by 5%, notably in the International region
with higher demand in China in both early and metastatic breast cancer settings. In the US, sales of Perjeta increased by 4% due
to growth in the adjuvant setting being largely offset by a reduction in sales volume following the launch of Phesgo. Herceptin
sales were 19% lower as a result of biosimilar erosion. Kadcyla sales increased by 7% driven by the usage in the early breast
cancer setting, with notable growth in Japan and Italy. The decrease of 3% in sales of Kadcyla in the US was due to competitive
pressure. Phesgo sales continued to show a strong uptake in Europe, notably in France and the UK, and in the US.

United States. Sales declined by 1% driven by a combined 25% fall in total MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin sales and
by lower sales of Actemra/RoActemra, Lucentis and Esbriet, partly offset by increased sales of Ocrevus, Vabysmo, Hemlibra
and Tecentriq. Vabysmo showed a high initial uptake, with both new patients and patients switching from other medications, and
achieved CHF 0.5 billion of sales in the US since its launch. Ocrevus sales increased by 14% driven by both new and returning
patient demand. Hemlibra continued to show growth in the non-inhibitor segment with a sales growth of 22%. Tecentriq sales
increased by 12% due to continued growth in new indications. Xolair sales increased by 9%, with growth in the chronic
spontaneous urticaria indication. Sales of Phesgo continued to show a strong uptake since the launch in 2020. Evrysdi showed
a continued uptake since its launch, with a sales growth of 23%. Actemra/RoActemra sales decreased by 35% due to lower
demand from hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in 2022. Esbriet sales declined mainly due to the launch of the first US generic
versions in the second quarter of 2022. Lucentis sales decreased due to competitive pressure.
Europe. Sales declined by 2% mainly driven by the base effect of Ronapreve in 2021. Excluding Ronapreve, sales grew by 6%
at CER, with sales of new products more than offsetting the impacts of biosimilar competition. The latter led to a combined
sales decline of 29% for MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin. Evrysdi showed high uptake mainly in Germany, the UK and
Italy. Phesgo reported strong momentum across all countries with France and the UK being key growth drivers. There was a
sales growth of 25% of Ocrevus, notably in Germany, Italy and Spain.
Japan. Sales increased by 26%, mainly as a result of Ronapreve sales of CHF 1.5 billion, supported by sales growth for
recently launched products including Evrysdi, Polivy, Hemlibra and Enspryng. This more than offset the impact of biosimilars
and government price cuts. There was a combined 18% fall in sales of MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin arising from
biosimilar competition. Price cuts in Japan had an impact across the portfolio.
International. Sales increased by 1% with a sales growth of 5% in Brazil and 4% in Canada. Sales in China were 7% lower mainly
driven by the biosimilar erosion for MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin and lower sales of Rocephin, partially offset by
continued sales growth of Alecensa, Gazyva/Gazyvaro and Perjeta. The COVID-19 restrictions in China had a certain negative
impact on sales across the product portfolio. Excluding China, sales in the International region increased by 6% mainly driven by
higher demand for Perjeta, Hemlibra, Ocrevus and Kadcyla.

Total – IFRS and Core basis 3,077 2,969 +3
Royalties and other operating income increased by 3% at CER. Royalty income was 15% lower due to lower royalty income from
Lucentis. Income from out-licensing agreements increased as a result of income from the Ultomiris patent settlement. Effective
17 March 2022 Chugai and Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (‘Alexion’), a fully-owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca PLC, entered into
a settlement agreement resolving all patent disputes between the two companies related to Ultomiris (ravulizumab). Under the
terms of the agreement, Alexion made a single payment of USD 775 million to Chugai. No further amounts are payable by either
party. The agreement includes the granting by Chugai to Alexion of a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully paid-up licence in respect
of Ultomiris. Accordingly, this revenue of CHF 726 million has been presented as ‘Income from out-licensing agreements’ in the
Roche Group’s financial statements, and in accordance with Roche’s established core results concept, has been treated as part
of core net income. Income from product disposals included the sale of rights for Rocaltrol for China for CHF 272 million, the
sale of the global rights for Valcyte for CHF 185 million and the sale of the global rights for Xeloda excluding China and Japan
for CHF 150 million. Profit-share income was lower due to a reduction of CHF 0.6 billion from the profit-sharing agreement with
Regeneron relating to US sales of Ronapreve. The profit-share income from sales of Venclexta/Venclyxto in the US increased by
13% to CHF 452 million.20 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2022

Core costs decreased by 2% at CER, primarily due to lower manufacturing costs, driven by a favourable product mix impact
in 2022. There were base effects in 2021 of incremental production costs of CHF 575 million arising from the response to the
COVID-19 pandemic and income of CHF 184 million from the reversal of an idle-plant impairment. As a percentage of sales,
cost of sales decreased by 0.7 percentage points to 20.3%. Royalty expenses were 18% higher driven by increased sales of
certain royalty-bearing products, notably Ocrevus and Evrysdi. Collaboration and profit-sharing expenses decreased by 4%
mainly due to lower sales of MabThera/Rituxan in the US. Impairment charges for intangible assets for marketed products were
CHF 1.5 billion. The main items were CHF 0.7 billion for the Gavreto intangible asset due to lower sales expectations. In addition
there were impairment charges of CHF 0.3 billion relating to Flatiron’s technology and CHF 0.3 billion for Rozlytrek from the
Ignyta acquisition. The decrease in amortisation charges of intangible assets was primarily attributable to the Esbriet intangible
asset becoming fully amortised in late 2021. Global restructuring costs are mainly related to the manufacturing network
strategy review impacting various sites including in the US, Switzerland and Germany.

Core costs increased by 2% at CER. As a percentage of sales, they increased to 14.6% from 14.5% in the comparative period.
Major marketing and distribution activities included investments in digital customer support and in ongoing launches, notably
Vabysmo. There was also spending on Ocrevus and Tecentriq, and on pre-launch activities. On an IFRS basis, costs decreased
mainly due to the restructuring costs in 2021 from transformation initiatives in sales affiliates.Finance Report 2022 Financial Review | Roche Group 21

Core costs increased by 1% at CER and represented 26.6% as a percentage of sales. Oncology remained the primary area
of research and development with the cancer immunotherapy portfolio being a key driver. Neuroscience, immunology and
ophthalmology represent significant areas of spending. The growth in 2022 was mostly driven by higher investments in
Spark Therapeutics to support the investigational programmes such as haemophilia A and B and studies relating to Pompe
disease. Chugai also showed an increase in spending driven by late-stage investments in oncology. There were continued
investments in research and development activities in China. This was offset by a decline in late-stage portfolio investments,
with significantly lower COVID-19-related spending for the co-development of Regeneron, which was CHF 163 million in 2021.
Intangible asset impairment charges for assets still in the research and development stage totalled CHF 1.4 billion. The major
items were a charge of CHF 0.5 billion for the partial impairment of the intangible asset SPK-8011, a novel gene therapy for the
treatment of haemophilia A that was acquired as part of the Spark Therapeutics acquisition, and a charge of CHF 0.4 billion
for the full impairment of the intangible asset PRM-151, a novel anti-fibrotic immunomodulator for the treatment of idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis that was acquired as part of the Promedior acquisition. Restructuring costs from the research and development
portfolio prioritisation programme are mainly related to study closure costs.
Additionally, in-licensing transactions, business combinations and asset acquisitions resulted in intangible assets of CHF 1.2 billion
(2021: CHF 1.1 billion) being recognised. See the above sections on ‘Mergers and acquisitions’ and ‘Alliance transactions’ for
further details.

lower mainly due to lower legal expenses. Business taxes and capital taxes decreased as a result of lower excise tax expense in
2022 in the US. Restructuring costs were lower than 2021, which included costs for the Basel/Kaiseraugst site. In 2022 income
from legal and environmental cases was due to a partial release of certain legal provisions based on the latest developments.22 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2022

Pharmaceuticals Division total core operating profit and operating profit both include the elimination of CHF minus 497 million of unrealised intercompany gains between
Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai (2021: CHF minus 596 million).
The increase in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen has an adverse impact of approximately 11 percentage points on the
Chugai results when expressed in Swiss francs for the Group’s consolidated results. At CER (as reported in Japanese yen), sales
by Chugai to external customers increased by 26%, driven by sales of Ronapreve, while sales within the division increased by
37% due to higher sales of Hemlibra by Chugai to Roche Pharmaceuticals. Chugai’s core operating profit increased by 23% as a
result of the income from the Ultomiris patent settlement and higher gross profit from sales to external customers and within
the division. This was partially offset by lower royalty income from Roche Pharmaceuticals and higher research and development
costs. Operating free cash flow at Chugai decreased by 2% mainly as a result of an increase in trade receivables due to Ronapreve
sales in December 2022, partially offset by the Ultomiris patent settlement and the underlying operating performance.

The absolute amount of the movement between the 2022 and 2021 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2022 transactions (translated at
average rates for 2021) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2022 transactions include non-cash movements and therefore the
movements in this table are not the same as the amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only includes the cash movements). A full consolidated balance sheet is
given on page 46 of the Annual Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given above is on page 170.Finance Report 2022 Financial Review | Roche Group 23
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc appreciated
significantly against the Japanese yen. This was partially compensated by the depreciation of the Swiss franc against the
US dollar. This resulted in a net negative translation impact. The exchange rates used are given on page 31.
Net working capital. Net working capital increased by 75% at CER, with trade receivables being the main driver. The increase
in trade receivables of 22% was driven by Ronapreve sales in Japan in December 2022 and by the extended payment terms
in the US for certain products. The increase was also due to Ocrevus sales growth in US, as well as the timing of US collections
generally. The increase in inventories of 15% was driven by ensuring supply resilience, notably for Actemra/RoActemra after
significant depletion of inventory levels due to previously high demand from COVID-19 patients, and also for critical raw materials
given global supply scarcity. The ramp-up of launch products, notably Vabysmo and Phesgo, was also a driver in the growth of
inventories. The net liability position for other receivables/payables increased due to lower receivables for the Regeneron profit-
share income.
Long-term net operating assets. Overall long-term net operating assets decreased by 6% at CER mainly due to lower
intangible assets and slightly offset by a decrease in provisions. Intangible assets decreased as a result of impairment charges,
as explained in the section ‘Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets’ above. Provisions decreased due to the recording
of restructuring provisions at the end of 2021 and the utilisation of these restructuring provisions in 2022. Capital expenditure
included manufacturing investments in Japan, the US, Switzerland and Germany as well as site developments in Switzerland,
South San Francisco and at Chugai’s research facilities in Yokohama.

the business, measured by the operating profit, net of operating cash adjustments, increased by 2%, while core operating profit
increased by 5%. This difference was mainly due to increased provisions in 2021. Net working capital absorbed an additional
CHF 1.7 billion of cash, driven by the increase in trade receivables and the increase in inventories, for the reasons described
above in the ‘Financial position’ section. Capital expenditure was 11% lower in comparison with 2021, with the major items also

Sales
The Diagnostics Division reported sales of CHF 17.7 billion, an increase of 3% at CER. There was growth in routine testing, which
more than compensated for the sales decrease from the lower demand for COVID-19-related products in 2022. Sales in the
division’s base business increased by 7% across all regions, with immunodiagnostics being the main growth driver. The sales
of COVID-19-related tests in 2022 decreased by 10% at CER to CHF 4.1 billion (2021: CHF 4.7 billion) due to lower demand for
COVID-19-related products, with the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test accounting for approximately 56% of the COVID-19-related
sales.
The SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test was the main growth driver in the Point of Care customer area while growth in routine
testing was the main contributor to the increased sales in the Core Lab and Pathology Lab customer areas. Sales in the
Molecular Lab customer area decreased due to lower COVID-19-related sales of SARS-CoV-2 assays on the cobas 6800/8800
range. Diabetes Care sales decreased by 2%, driven by the base effect from the resolution of a rebate dispute in 2021.

a) In 2022 sales in the Point of Care customer area included sales from the Liat business (POC molecular) and sales in the Core Lab customer area included sales from the
Life Science Alliances business. These were both previously shown as part of the Molecular Lab customer area. The comparative information for 2021 has been restated
accordingly. Sales for 2021 were: POC molecular CHF 551 million, Life Science Alliances CHF 87 million.
Core Lab. This customer area focuses on central labs and provides diagnostics solutions in the areas of immunoassays, clinical
chemistry and custom biotech. Sales increased by 6% due to the 7% growth in immunodiagnostics products, such as cardiac
and oncology tests, and the 9% growth in the clinical chemistry business. Sales in the custom biotech business were 7% lower.
Sales grew across all regions, with the largest contribution coming from the Asia-Pacific and EMEA regions, which grew by 8%
and 6%, respectively.
Point of Care. This customer area provides diagnostics solutions immediately at the point of care such as in emergency rooms,
general practitioners’ practices and directly with patients, and includes blood gas and electrolyte (BGE) tests. Sales of the
SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test are reported in this customer area and these were the main driver of the 17% sales growth.
Sales of these tests were concentrated in the Asia-Pacific and North America regions.
Molecular Lab. This customer area focuses on molecular labs and provides diagnostics solutions for the detection and
monitoring of pathogens, donor screening, sexual health and genomics. Sales declined by 15% due to lower COVID-19-related
sales of SARS-CoV-2 assays on the cobas 6800/8800 range, partly offset by growth in the base business across the portfolio.
Diabetes Care. This customer area provides diagnostics solutions for patients and healthcare professionals enabling integrated
personalised diabetes management. Sales decreased by 2% due to the base effect of the resolution of a rebate dispute in
2021. Excluding this, sales remained stable. The continued contraction of the blood glucose monitoring market due to patients
switching to continuous glucose monitoring systems, in particular in the US and major European markets, was offset by higher
demand in emerging markets.

Sales in the EMEA region decreased by 16% due to the significant reduction of COVID-19-related sales compared to the
previous year, partly offset by growth in the immunoassay business. In North America the 13% sales growth was driven by
the sales of the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test. Asia-Pacific sales were 23% higher as a result of increased sales of the
SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test and due to growth in the immunoassays business.

Core costs increased by 4% at CER. This increase was above the sales growth of 3% and arose from the product mix driven
by increased sales volumes of SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen tests and lower volumes of SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. There were
also higher freight costs. In 2021 impairments on property, plant and equipment were incurred in connection with the at-risk
manufacturing ramp-up and rollout of COVID-19-related products. The core cost of sales ratio increased by 0.8 percentage

The absolute amount of the movement between the 2022 and 2021 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2022 transactions (translated at
average rates for 2021) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2022 transactions include non-cash movements and therefore the
movements in this table are not the same as the amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only includes the cash movements). A full consolidated balance sheet is
given on page 46 of the Annual Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given above is on page 170.
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc appreciated
against the euro having a negative effect on the net operating assets of the Diagnostics Division. This resulted in a negative net
translation impact. The exchange rates used are given on page 31.
Net working capital. Net working capital increased by 14% at CER driven by the 15% increase in inventories. The increase
was in part to support the growth of the division’s base business notably in the Core Lab customer area. In addition, there
were increased inbound shipments of instruments towards the end of year due to the recovery from a supply backlog. The 5%
decrease in trade receivables was due to the lower demand for COVID-19-related tests in the last quarter of 2022 compared
to 2021. The decrease in net liability for other receivables/payables came from higher employee-related accruals in 2021.
Long-term net operating assets. Overall long-term net operating assets increased by 4% at CER. Property, plant and
equipment increased as a result of instrument placements as well as site investments in Germany and the US. Goodwill and
intangible assets decreased by 1% at CER following the regular amortisation charges, partly offset by contingent payments
for asset acquisitions previously closed. Provisions were lower due to the utilisation and release of restructuring provisions
and the release of contingent consideration provisions.Finance Report 2022 Financial Review | Roche Group 29

2021. The cash generation of the business, measured by the operating profit, net of operating cash adjustments, decreased by
5%, in line with the core operating profit decrease of 5%. Net working capital absorbed CHF 0.7 billion of cash in 2022 which
was attributable to higher inventories as described above in the ‘Financial position’ section. Capital expenditure increased by
4% due to instrument placements as well as site investments in Germany and the US.30 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2022

Administration costs were higher by 2%, which was related to cost transfers into corporate functions. Other general items
decreased mainly due to lower IT project costs within the overall net amount. Net working capital was lower due to increased
payables. The change in long-term net operating assets was due to the utilisation of provisions for ongoing environmental
remediation activities at Nutley in the US and at Grenzach in Germany. Corporate operating free cash flow showed an increased
outflow, driven by movements in the net working capital and increased capital expenditure.Finance Report 2022 Financial Review | Roche Group 31

The Group’s revenues are primarily generated from sales of products to customers. Such revenues are mainly received in the
local currency of the customer’s home market, although in certain emerging markets invoicing is made in major international
currencies such as the US dollar and euro. Cost of sales, marketing and some administration costs follow the same currency
pattern as sales. The majority of research and development activities are incurred at the Group’s global research facilities, and
therefore the costs are mainly concentrated in US dollars, Swiss francs and euros. General and administration costs tend to
be incurred mainly at central locations in the US, Switzerland and Germany. Chugai’s revenues and costs are denominated in
Japanese yen.32 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2022

Financing costs
Core financing costs were CHF 686 million, an increase of 64% at CER compared to 2021. Interest expenses on debt increased
by 81% at CER to CHF 588 million due to the issuance of debt in December 2021, February, March and September 2022 as well
as increases in interest rates which affected the cost of short-term borrowings, such as commercial paper. A full analysis of
financing costs is given in Note 4 to the Annual Financial Statements.Finance Report 2022 Financial Review | Roche Group 33
Other financial income (expense)
Core other financial income (expense) was a net expense of CHF 528 million compared to a net expense of CHF 339 million in
2021. Core net income from equity securities, which reflects the fair value changes in the Roche Venture Fund investments,
was a net loss of CHF 123 million (2021: net loss of CHF 87 million). The net foreign exchange results, which reflect hedging
costs and gains and losses on unhedged positions, were net losses of CHF 278 million (2021: net losses of CHF 232 million).
Losses on the net monetary positions in hyperinflationary economies in Argentina and Türkiye were CHF 70 million (2021: losses
of CHF 20 million). A full analysis of other financial income (expense) is given in Note 4 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Income taxes
The Group’s effective core tax rate increased by 1.9 percentage points to 16.4% in 2022. The increase was mainly due to the
impact from the resolution of several tax disputes, which reduced the Group’s effective core tax rate by 1.5 percentage points
in 2022 compared to 3.3 percentage points in 2021.
The IFRS results saw the effective tax rate increase by 2.9 percentage points. In addition to the core impacts mentioned above,
the impairments of intangible assets that are not tax deductible further increased the IFRS tax rate.
Further details of the Group’s income tax expenses and related balance sheet positions are given in Note 5 to the Annual
Financial Statements.

Financial position
The decrease in net debt was due to the free cash flow of CHF 13.0 billion, partly offset by the dividend payments of CHF 7.8 billion.
The CHF 19.0 billion bridge loan facility drawn in 2021 to finance the share repurchase from Novartis was fully repaid by
May 2022, partly from the proceeds from the new debt issuances and partly from internal cash generation. The new debt issued
to refinance the bridge loan facility was USD 6.0 billion issued in December 2021, CHF 3.0 billion issued in February 2022 and
USD 5.0 billion issued in March 2022. Further debt of CHF 0.8 billion was issued in September 2022. Lease liabilities decreased
to CHF 1.2 billion due to the regular payments. The net pension liability was lower following increases in discount rates. The
net tax assets increased mainly due to taxes paid exceeding the income tax expenses, partially offset by the deferred tax effects
of the pension and equity compensation plans. At 31 December 2022 the Group held equity investments with a market value of
CHF 0.7 billion, which consist mostly of holdings in biotechnology and other pharmaceuticals companies which were acquired
as part of licensing transactions and scientific collaborations or as investments of the Roche Venture Fund. The net derivative
liabilities increased to CHF 0.5 billion as a result of interest rate and exchange rate movements.
Free cash flow
The net cash outflow from treasury activities was CHF 0.5 billion compared to an outflow of CHF 0.4 billion in 2021. This was
mainly due to higher interest payments following increases in interest rates that affected the cost of short-term borrowings.
Total taxes paid were CHF 4.1 billion, an increase of 26% at CER, with higher payments in the US due to tax requirements on the
mandatory capitalisation of research and development expenses becoming effective in 2022, and higher payments in Japan.34 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2022

Operating free cash flow decreased by 8% at CER to CHF 17.7 billion. This was mainly due to the increased net working capital
that absorbed an additional CHF 2.4 billion of cash, driven by the increase in trade receivables in the Pharmaceuticals Division
and inventories in both divisions. The free cash flow was CHF 13.0 billion, a decrease of 16% at CER. This was a result of the lower
operating free cash flow, higher short-term borrowing costs due to increased interest rates and higher tax payments, notably in
the US and Japan.Finance Report 2022 Financial Review | Roche Group 35

The net debt position of the Group at 31 December 2022 was CHF 15.6 billion, a decrease of CHF 2.6 billion from 31 December 2021.
The decrease was due to the free cash flow of CHF 13.0 billion, which exceeded the CHF 7.8 billion for the annual dividend
payments, the CHF 1.3 billion for transactions in own equity instruments and the CHF 0.6 billion for currency translation. Dividend
payments were lower than in 2021 due to the cancellation in February 2022 of the shares acquired from Novartis in 2021.
Transactions in own equity instruments related to purchases in connection with the Group’s equity compensation plans. Payments
for hedging and collateral arrangements consist of foreign currency forwards of CHF 0.3 billion and net collateral payments of
CHF 0.2 billion.36 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2022

Debt. This consists mainly of bonds and notes and includes the principal and interest on the Group’s debt instruments. Other
debt is mainly commercial paper. The carrying values are discounted based on the interest rates inherent in the instruments.
Contingent consideration. This consists of potential payments arising from mergers and acquisitions. The carrying values are
risk-adjusted and discounted.
Unfunded defined benefit plans. These are mainly the pension plans in the Group’s German affiliates, where the fully
reserved pension obligations are used for self-financing of the local affiliates’ operations. The carrying values are discounted.
Future company contributions to the Group’s funded plans are not shown in the above table.
Capital commitments for property, plant and equipment. These are non-cancellable commitments for the purchase and
construction mainly at the Roche sites in Basel, Switzerland, South San Francisco, US, and Penzberg, Germany, and also at new
manufacturing sites of Chugai in Japan.
Leasing commitments. These are the major non-cancellable commitments for signed lease agreements where the
lease term has not yet started. These mainly relate to the US sites of Foundation Medicine in Boston and Genentech in
South San Francisco.Finance Report 2022 Financial Review | Roche Group 37
Contract manufacturing commitments. These are the future minimum take-or-pay commitments to purchase inventories
arising from the Group’s major long-term agreements with external Contract Manufacturing Organisations (CMOs).
Alliance collaboration commitments. These are potential upfront and milestone payments that may become due from the
Group’s in-licensing and alliance arrangements and intangible asset purchase agreements, including asset acquisitions.
Potential payments to alliance partners and for asset purchase agreements within the next three years are included assuming
all projects currently in development are successful. Potential payments beyond three years are only included for asset
purchase agreements.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions into
a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation to pay further
contributions. In 2022 expenses for the Group’s defined contribution plans were CHF 452 million (2021: CHF 419 million). All
other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’, even if the Group’s potential obligation is minor or has a relatively remote
possibility of arising. Plans are usually established as trusts which are independent of the Group and are funded by payments
from the Group and by employees, but in some cases the plan is unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees
directly from its own financial resources. In 2022 expenses for the Group’s defined benefit plans were CHF 693 million
(2021: CHF 749 million).

Overall the funding status on an IFRS basis of the Group’s funded defined benefit plans increased to 113% compared to 105%
at the start of the year. This came from a reduction of the defined benefit obligation due to an increase in discount rates in all
relevant regions compared to the end of 2021, partly offset by a decrease in the fair value of plan assets. A limit on asset
recognition arose during 2022 as a result of a surplus, based on current market assumptions, in certain Swiss pension plans that
was not recognisable under IFRS. The funding status of the pension funds is monitored by the local pension fund governance
bodies as well as being closely reviewed at a Group level.
The unfunded plans are mainly those in the Group’s German affiliates, where the fully reserved pension obligations are
invested in the local affiliate’s operations. The unfunded liabilities for these plans decreased during 2022 due to an increase in
the eurozone discount rate, partly offset by an increase in the eurozone inflation rate.
Full details of the Group’s pensions and other post-employment benefits are given in Note 26 to the Annual Financial Statements.38 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2022

In 2022 Roche ranked number 15 among a peer group consisting of Roche and 15 other healthcare companiesa) for Total
Shareholder Return (TSR), defined as share price growth plus dividends, measured in Swiss francs at actual exchange rates.
At constant exchange rates (CER) Roche ranked number 14, with the year-end return being –10.3% for Roche shares and
–21.4% for Roche non-voting equity securities. The combined performance of share and non-voting equity security was –19.6%
compared to a weighted average return for the peer group of +10.6% in CHF terms and +10.9% at CER. The development
of the Roche share price during 2022 was influenced by negative news flow on the research and development pipeline and an
expected decline in COVID-19-related sales.
On 6 December 2021, Roche repurchased 53.3 million Roche shares held by Novartis for a total consideration of CHF 19.0 billion.
The repurchased shares were reported as treasury shares as at 31 December 2021 and were cancelled in February 2022 when
the necessary legal procedures were completed.
In 2022 the healthcare sector outperformed world equity markets which were impacted by strong inflation and rising interest
rates. Growth of the Swiss Market Index (SMI) slightly trailed major US indices. Roche shares outperformed the SMI while Roche
non-voting equity securities underperformed the SMI.

Proposed dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing an increase of 2% in the dividend for 2022 to CHF 9.50 per share and non-voting equity
security (2021: CHF 9.30) for approval at the Annual General Meeting. This would be the 36th consecutive increase in the
dividend. If the dividend proposal is approved by shareholders, dividend payments on the total shares and non-voting equity
securities will amount to CHF 7.7 billion (2021: CHF 7.5 billion). This dividend proposal would result in a pay-out ratio (based on
core net income) of 46.8% (2021: 46.9%). Based on the prices at the end of 2022, the dividend yield on the Roche share was
2.7% (2021: 2.3%) and the yield on the non-voting equity security was 3.3% (2021: 2.5%). Further information on the Roche
securities is given on pages 172 to 174.

The Group plans to meet its debt obligations using existing liquid funds as well as cash generated from business operations.
In 2022 the free cash flow was CHF 13.0 billion (2021: CHF 15.7 billion), which included the cash generated from operations as
well as the payment of interest and taxes.
For short-term financing requirements, the Group has a commercial paper program in the US under which it can issue up to
USD 7.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper notes and has committed credit lines of USD 7.5 billion available as back-stop
lines. Commercial paper notes totalling USD 1.9 billion were outstanding as of 31 December 2022 (2021: USD 0.5 billion).
For longer-term financing the Group maintains high long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA by Standard & Poor’s, Aa2
by Moody’s and AA by Fitch which should facilitate efficient access to international capital markets.

Financial risks
At 31 December 2022 the Group had a net debt position of CHF 15.6 billion (2021: CHF 18.2 billion). The financial assets of the
Group are managed in a conservative way with the objective to meet the Group’s financial obligations at all times.
Asset allocation. A considerable portion of the cash and marketable securities the Group currently holds is being used for debt
repayment. Liquid funds are either held as cash or are invested in high-quality, investment-grade fixed income securities with an
investment horizon to meet those liquidity requirements.

Debt securities 583 6 565 4

Total cash and marketable securities 9,767 100 13,031 100
Credit risk. Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations causing
financial losses for the Group. The rating profile of the Group’s CHF 9.8 billion of cash and fixed income marketable securities
remained high with 93% being invested in the A–AAA range. The Group has signed netting and collateral agreements with
the counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty risk on derivative positions. Bad debt expenses and overdue receivables
remained at a relatively low level.
Liquidity risk. Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point
in time. The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity
requirements at any point in time. In addition to the current liquidity position, the Group has strong cash generation ability.
Those future cash flows will be used to repay debt instruments in the coming years. Free cash flow was CHF 13.0 billion as
compared to CHF 15.7 billion in 2021.
The Roche Group continues to enjoy high long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA by Standard & Poor’s, Aa2 by Moody’s
and AA by Fitch. At the same time Roche is rated at the highest available short-term ratings by those agencies. In the event of
financing requirements, the credit ratings of the Roche Group should permit efficient access to international capital markets,
including the commercial paper market. The Group has committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling
USD 7.5 billion available as back-stop lines for the commercial paper program. As at 31 December 2022 no debt has been drawn
under these credit lines.
Market risk. Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities. The exposures
are predominantly related to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The Group uses Value-at-Risk
(VaR) to assess the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. VaR data indicates the value range within which a given
financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices. The Group’s VaR has
increased since 31 December 2021 reflecting bond issuances during 2022.
Interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could affect the Group’s financial result or the
value of the Group equity. The Group may use interest rate derivatives to manage its interest rate-related exposure and financial
result.
Further information on financial risk management and financial risks and the VaR methodology is included in Note 31 to the
Annual Financial Statements.42 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2022
International Financial Reporting Standards
The Roche Group has been using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to report its consolidated results since
1990.
New and revised standards applied in 2022
In 2022 the Group implemented various minor amendments to existing standards and interpretations which have no material
impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position.

Notes to the Roche Group
Consolidated Financial Statements
1. General accounting principles
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements (hereafter ‘the Annual Financial Statements’) of the Roche Group have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. They have been prepared using
the historical cost convention except for items that are required to be accounted for at fair value. They were approved for issue
by the Board of Directors on 31 January 2023 and are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on
14 March 2023.
These financial statements are the Annual Financial Statements of Roche Holding Ltd, a company registered in Switzerland, and
its subsidiaries (‘the Group’).
The Group’s significant accounting policies and changes in accounting policies are disclosed in Note 34.
Key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Annual Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingent amounts. Actual outcomes could differ
from those management estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based
on historical experience and various other factors. Revisions to estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is
revised. The following are considered to be the key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions made and are believed
to be appropriate based upon currently available information.
Revenue. The nature of the Group’s business is such that many sales transactions do not have a simple structure and may consist
of various performance obligations that are satisfied at different times. Contracts entered into in the Diagnostics Division
typically include performance obligations for instruments (including those provided under leasing arrangements), reagents and
other consumables, and services. Instruments may be sold in cash sales transactions at discounted prices. Where instruments
are provided under operating lease arrangements, some or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent
reagents sales. Major sources of estimation uncertainty are related to measurement of sales, net of discounts, for the related
obligations, including their stand-alone selling prices. It requires judgement to determine when different obligations are satisfied,
including whether enforceable purchase commitments for further obligations exist and when they arise. Out-licensing agreements
may be entered into with no further obligation or may include commitments to conduct research, late-stage development,
regulatory approval, co-marketing or manufacturing. These may be settled by a combination of upfront payments, milestone
payments, other licensing fees, and reimbursements for services provided. Whether to consider these commitments as a single
performance obligation or separate ones, or even being in scope of IFRS 15 ‘Revenues from Contracts with Customers’, is not
straightforward and requires some judgement. Depending on the conclusion, this may result in all revenue being calculated at
inception and either being recognised at once or spread over the term of a longer performance obligation.
Major sources of estimation uncertainty are related to the measurement of sales, which are recorded net of allowances for
estimated rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts and estimates of product returns, all of which are established at the time
of sale. All product sales allowances are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales.
At 31 December 2022 the Group had CHF 4,767 million in provisions and accruals for expected sales returns, chargebacks and
other rebates, including Medicaid in the US and similar rebates in other countries (2021: CHF 4,720 million). The provisions
and accruals relating to the US pharmaceuticals business amounted to CHF 2,120 million (2021: CHF 2,182 million), of which
CHF 510 million (2021: CHF 432 million) were associated with expected sales returns. These estimates take into consideration
historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends such as
competitive pricing and new product introductions, estimated inventory levels, and the shelf life of products. If actual
future results vary, these estimates need to be adjusted, with an effect on sales and earnings in the period of the adjustment.50 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
Business combinations. The Group initially recognises the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed,
any non-controlling interest and the consideration transferred in a business combination. Management judgement is particularly
involved in the assessment of whether or not the net assets acquired constitute a business and in the recognition and fair value
measurement of intellectual property, inventories, contingent liabilities and contingent consideration. In making this assessment,
management applies judgement in considering the underlying economic substance of the items concerned in addition to
the contractual terms. When considered appropriate as a result from its judgement, management also applies the optional
‘concentration test’ as set out in IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ to aid the assessment of whether a transaction represents a
business combination or is simply in substance the purchase of a single asset or group of similar assets.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, goodwill and intangible assets. At 31 December 2022
the Group had CHF 23,075 million in property, plant and equipment (see Note 8), CHF 1,133 million in right-of-use assets
(see Note 28), CHF 10,820 million in goodwill (see Note 9) and CHF 9,685 million in intangible assets (see Note 10). Goodwill and
intangible assets not yet available for use are reviewed annually for impairment. Property, plant and equipment, right-of-use
assets and intangible assets in use are assessed for impairment when there is a triggering event that provides evidence that
an asset may be impaired. To assess whether any impairment exists, estimates of expected future cash flows are used. Actual
outcomes could vary significantly from such estimates. Other estimates relate to factors such as changes in discount rates, the
planned use of buildings, machinery or equipment or closure of facilities, the presence of competition, technical obsolescence
and lower-than-anticipated product sales, which could lead to shorter useful lives or impairment.
Impairment of financial assets. At 31 December 2022 the Group had CHF 490 million in allowance for doubtful accounts for
trade and lease receivables (see Note 12). Key estimates for the allowance for doubtful accounts are mainly related to risk of
default and expected loss rates. For making these estimates, inputs selected to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts
are based on the company’s past experience, existing market conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the end of
each reporting period.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits. The Group operates a number of defined benefit plans, and the fair values of
the recognised plan assets and liabilities are based upon statistical and actuarial calculations. Key estimates are required for
the measurement of the net defined benefit obligation, which is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate, inflation
rate, expected mortality and medical cost trend rate assumptions. At 31 December 2022 the present value of the Group’s
defined benefit obligation was CHF 18,734 million (see Note 26). The actuarial assumptions used for those estimates may differ
materially from actual results due to changes in market and economic conditions, longer or shorter lifespans of participants,
and other changes in the factors being assessed. These differences could impact the defined benefit plan assets and liabilities
recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Legal provisions. The Group provides for anticipated legal settlement costs when there is a probable outflow of resources
that can be reliably estimated. Where no reliable estimate can be made, no provision is recorded and contingent liabilities are
disclosed where material. At 31 December 2022 the Group had CHF 316 million in legal provisions. The status of significant
legal cases is disclosed in Note 20. These estimates consider the specific circumstances of each legal case, relevant legal
advice and are inherently uncertain due to the highly complex nature of legal cases. The estimates could change substantially
over time as new facts emerge and each legal case progresses.
Environmental provisions. The Group provides for anticipated environmental remediation costs when there is a probable
outflow of resources that can be reasonably estimated. At 31 December 2022 the Group had CHF 374 million in environmental
provisions (see Note 20). Environmental provisions consist primarily of costs to fully clean and refurbish contaminated sites,
including landfills, and to treat and contain contamination at certain other sites. These estimates are inherently uncertain as
assumptions are required related to the detection of previously unknown contamination, the method and extent of remediation,
the percentage of the problematic materials attributable to the Group at the remediation sites, and the financial capabilities
of other potentially responsible parties. The estimates could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each
environmental remediation progresses.
Contingent consideration provisions. The Group makes provision for the estimated fair value of contingent consideration
arrangements arising from business combinations. At 31 December 2022 the Group had CHF 103 million in contingent
consideration provisions (see Note 20) and the total potential payments under contingent consideration arrangements from
business combinations could be up to CHF 353 million (see Note 31). Key estimates are required to determine the amounts of
the expected payments to be provided for, by considering the possible scenarios of forecast sales and other performance
criteria, the amount to be paid under each scenario, and the probability of each scenario, which is then discounted to a net
present value. These estimates could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each scenario develops.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 51
Income taxes. At 31 December 2022 the Group had a current income tax net liability of CHF 2,874 million and a deferred tax
net asset of CHF 5,782 million (see Note 5). Major sources of estimation uncertainty are related to the calculation of current
and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations.
Where tax positions are uncertain, accruals are recorded within income tax liabilities for management’s best estimate of the
ultimate liability that is expected to arise based on the specific circumstances and the Group’s historical experience. Factors
that may have an impact on the estimates of current and deferred tax balances include changes in tax laws, regulations or
rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, future levels of research and development spending and
changes in pre-tax earnings.
Leases. Where the Group is the lessee, key judgements include assessing whether arrangements contain a lease and
determining the lease term. To assess whether a contract contains a lease requires judgement about whether it depends on
a specified asset, whether the Group obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset, and whether
the Group has a right to direct the use of the asset. In order to determine the lease term, judgement is required as extension
and termination options have to be assessed along with all facts and circumstances that may create an economic incentive
to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Estimates include calculating the discount rate which is
based on the incremental borrowing rate. At 31 December 2022 the Group had CHF 1,133 million in right-of-use assets and
CHF 1,193 million in lease liabilities (see Note 28).
Where the Group is the lessor, the treatment of leasing transactions is mainly determined by whether the lease is considered
to be an operating or finance lease, which requires judgement. In making this assessment, management looks at the substance
of the lease, as well as the legal form, and makes a judgement about whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of
ownership are transferred. Arrangements which do not take the legal form of a lease but that nevertheless convey the right to
use an asset are also covered by such judgemental assessments.
Consolidation. The Group periodically undertakes transactions that may involve obtaining control or significant influence
over other companies. These transactions include equity acquisitions, asset purchases and alliance agreements. In all such
cases it requires judgement for management to make an assessment as to whether the Group has control or significant
influence over the other company, and whether it should be consolidated as a subsidiary or accounted for as an associated
company. In making this judgemental assessment, management considers the underlying economic substance of the
transaction in addition to the contractual terms.
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
The Group has assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecast financial information
taking into account the potential future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The accounting matters assessed included,
but were not limited to, the Group’s provisions for product returns, allowances for doubtful accounts for trade and lease
receivables, inventory allowances as well as the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment. Any continued negative impacts from the pandemic in 2023 may have an impact on these, or other, matters.
While there was no significant impact from the areas assessed on the Group’s Annual Financial Statements, the Group will
continue to monitor these areas of increased judgements and risk for material changes.52 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
2. Operating segment information
The Group has two divisions, Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. Revenues are primarily generated from the sale of prescription
pharmaceutical products and diagnostic instruments, reagents and consumables, respectively. Both divisions also derive
revenues from the sale or licensing of products or technology to third parties. Residual operating activities from divested
businesses and certain global activities are reported as ‘Corporate’. These include the Corporate Executive Committee
and global Group functions for communications, human resources, finance (including treasury and taxes), legal, safety and
environmental services. Subdivisional information is also presented for the Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai operating
segments within the Pharmaceuticals Division.

Gross-to-net sales reconciliation for the Pharmaceuticals Division
The gross-to-net sales reconciliation for the Pharmaceuticals Division is shown in the table below. The companies in the
Diagnostics Division have similar reconciling items, but at much lower amounts.

Net sales 45,551 45,041
Government and regulatory mandatory price reductions. These consist of mandatory price reductions. The major elements
are the 340B Drug Discount Program, Medicaid and other plans in the US, which totalled USD 4.9 billion, equivalent to
CHF 4.7 billion (2021: USD 5.5 billion, equivalent to CHF 5.0 billion).
Contractual price reductions. These include rebates and chargebacks that are the result of contractual agreements that are
primarily volume based and performance based.
Cash discounts. These include credits offered to wholesalers for remitting payment on their purchases within contractually
defined incentive periods.
Customer returns reserves. These are allowances established for expected product returns.
Sales reductions that are expected to be withheld by the customer upon settlement, such as contractual price reductions and
cash discounts, are recorded in the balance sheet as a deduction from trade receivables (see Note 12). Sales reductions that
are separately payable to customers, governmental health authorities or healthcare regulatory authorities are recorded in
the balance sheet as accrued liabilities (see Note 19). Provisions for sales returns are recorded in the balance sheet as other
provisions (see Note 20).

Revenue recognised in relation to performance obligations satisfied in previous years
In 2022 there was an increase in revenue recognised of CHF 102 million (2021: decrease in revenue of CHF 28 million) relating
to performance obligations that had been satisfied in previous periods, mainly due to adjustments of sales deduction provisions
and accruals for expected sales returns, chargebacks and other allowances in respect of previous years.
Remaining performance obligations in (partially) unsatisfied long-term contracts
Remaining performance obligations in (partially) unsatisfied long-term contracts are either included in deferred income or are
related to amounts the Group expects to receive for goods and services that have not yet been transferred to customers under
existing, non-cancellable or otherwise enforceable contracts. These are mainly associated with contracts in the Diagnostics
Division that have minimum purchase commitments related to reagents and consumables for previously sold instruments as well
as monitoring and maintenance services. For contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, the Group has elected
the practical expedient to not disclose the transaction price for remaining performance obligations at the end of each reporting
period and at which point in time the Group expects to recognise these sales.

Hyperinflationary economies
The Group has considered Argentina (since 1 July 2018) and Türkiye (since 1 April 2022) to be hyperinflationary economies
in the context of IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’. The cumulative inflation index exceeds 100%
for Argentina over the last three years as measured by the National Wholesale Price Index (Sistema de Índices de Precios
Mayoristas) and for Türkiye in 2022 as measured by the consumer price index published by the Turkish Statistical Institute.
Accordingly the Group has reviewed the reporting from its affiliates in Argentina and Türkiye, and where necessary restated
them in line with IAS 29. The potential adjustments resulting from the application of IAS 29 do not have a significant impact on
the Group’s operating results and balance sheet. An adjustment is recorded for the gains (losses) on the net monetary positions,
which is a loss of CHF 70 million resulting from the loss in purchasing power of the positive net monetary positions during 2022
of the Group’s affiliates in Argentina and Türkiye (2021: loss of CHF 20 million for the Group’s affiliates in Argentina).Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 61

Since the Group operates internationally, it is subject to income taxes in many different tax jurisdictions. The Group calculates
its average expected tax rate as a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
This rate changes from year to year due to changes in the mix of the Group’s taxable income and changes in local tax rates.
The Group’s average expected tax rate was stable at 18.7% in 2022 (2021: 18.7%). During 2022 there were no significant
changes to local tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The Group’s effective tax rate increased to 17.1% in 2022 (2021: 14.2%). This was mainly due to the lower effect from the
resolution of several tax disputes in 2022 compared to 2021 and the impairments of intangible assets that are not tax deductible.
The Group’s effective tax rate can be reconciled to the Group’s average expected tax rate as follows:
Reconciliation of the Group’s effective tax rate
2022 2021
Average expected tax rate 18.7% 18.7%
Tax effect of
– Non-taxable income/non-deductible expenses +1.8% +0.7%
– Equity compensation plans +0.4% 0.0%
– Research and development tax credits and other deductions –3.0% –2.1%
– US state tax impacts +0.5% +0.5%
– Tax on unremitted earnings +0.1% +0.2%
– Resolution of several tax disputes –1.9% –4.0%
– Prior-year and other differences +0.5% +0.2%
Group’s effective tax rate 17.1% 14.2%
The income tax benefit recorded in respect of equity compensation plans, which varies according to the price of the underlying
equity, was CHF 58 million (2021: CHF 117 million). Had the income tax benefits been recorded solely on the basis of the IFRS 2
expense multiplied by the applicable tax rate, then a benefit of approximately CHF 126 million (2021: CHF 113 million) would have
been recorded.

The net deferred tax assets for other temporary differences mainly relate to accrued and other liabilities, including lease
liabilities, provisions and unrealised profit in inventory.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward only to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit is
probable. The Group has unrecognised tax losses, including valuation allowances, as follows:
Unrecognised tax losses: expiry
2022 2021
Amount Applicable Amount Applicable
(CHF m) tax rate (CHF m) tax rate
Within one year 279 12% 669 12%
Between one and five years 3,433 12% 2,696 12%
More than five years 7,134 6% 8,142 7%
Total unrecognised tax losses 10,846 8% 11,507 8%
The ‘More than five years’ category includes losses that cannot be used for US state income tax purposes in those states which
only permit tax reporting on a separate entity basis.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been established for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the remittance
of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, where such amounts are currently regarded as permanently reinvested for the purpose of
these financial statements. The total unremitted earnings of the Group, regarded as permanently reinvested for the purpose of
these financial statements, were CHF 28.3 billion at 31 December 2022 (2021: CHF 31.9 billion).64 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
6. Mergers and acquisitions
This note includes both transactions accounted for as business combinations and asset acquisitions. Asset acquisitions are
acquisitions of legal entities that do not qualify as business combinations under IFRS 3 and include those acquisitions where the
value in these acquired companies largely consists of the rights to a single asset, e.g. a product or technology, or to a group
of similar assets. Cash consideration paid for asset acquisitions at the transaction date and subsequent additional contingent
payments made upon the achievement of performance-related development milestones are presented in the line ‘Cash flows
from asset acquisitions’ as disclosed separately below. Subsequent consideration for performance-related development
milestones for transactions treated as asset acquisitions is recognised as intangible assets when the specific milestones have
been achieved and other recognition criteria are met.
Business combinations – 2022
The Group did not complete any business combinations in 2022.
Business combinations – 2021
GenMark Diagnostics, Inc. On 22 April 2021 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in GenMark Diagnostics, Inc.
(‘GenMark’), a publicly owned US company based in Carlsbad, California, that had been listed on Nasdaq. GenMark is reported in
the Diagnostics Division. The total consideration was USD 1,865 million, which was paid in cash.
TIB Molbiol Group. On 1 December 2021 the Group acquired a 100% interest in TIB Molbiol Group (‘TIB Molbiol’), a privately
owned group based in Berlin, Germany. TIB Molbiol is reported in the Diagnostics Division. The total consideration was
EUR 492 million, which was paid in cash.
Protocol First, Inc. On 14 December 2021 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Protocol First, Inc. (‘Protocol First’),
a privately owned US company based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Protocol First is reported in the Pharmaceuticals Division. The total
consideration was USD 55 million, which was paid in cash.

GenMark’s intangible assets are mainly related to the ePlex systems that are designed to support a broad range of molecular
diagnostics sample-to-answer tests with compact, easy-to-use workstations and self-contained, disposable test cartridges.
The fair value of the intangible assets was determined using an excess earnings method that is based on management forecasts
and observable market data for discount rates, tax rates and foreign exchange rates. The present value of the product
intangible asset for GenMark’s ePlex technology was calculated using a risk-adjusted discount rate of 10.0%. The present value
of TIB Molbiol’s product intangible assets and Protocol First’s other intangibles was calculated using a risk-adjusted discount
rate of 7.8% and 10.0%, respectively. The valuations were performed by independent valuers.
The GenMark goodwill represents the technological capabilities in multiplex molecular diagnostic solutions. Furthermore,
it represents a control premium, the acquired workforce and the expected synergies, notably in the areas of manufacturing
as well as commercialisation. Both the TIB Molbiol and Protocol First goodwill represent a control premium, the acquired
workforce and the expected synergies. The goodwill from the GenMark and TIB Molbiol transactions is allocated to the
Diagnostics customer areas as cash-generating units. The goodwill from the Protocol First transaction is allocated to Roche
Pharmaceuticals as cash-generating unit. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The accounts receivable was comprised of gross contractual amounts due of CHF 18 million from the GenMark acquisition and
CHF 7 million from the TIB Molbiol acquisition which were all expected to be collectable at the date of the acquisition.
Directly attributable transaction costs of CHF 8 million were reported in the Diagnostics operating segment and CHF 1 million
in the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment, both within general and administration expenses.
In the eight months ended 31 December 2021 GenMark contributed revenue of CHF 114 million and a net loss (after tax) of
CHF 75 million to the results reported for the Diagnostics Division, where it is reported in the Molecular Lab customer area,
and the Group. The impact of the TIB Molbiol acquisition on the 2021 results for the Diagnostics Division, where it is reported
in the Molecular Lab customer area, and the Group were not material. If both acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2021
management estimates that GenMark and TIB Molbiol would have contributed revenue of approximately CHF 210 million and
a net loss (including intangible asset amortisation and after tax) of approximately CHF 80 million in 2021. This information is
provided for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have
occurred had GenMark and TIB Molbiol actually been acquired at the beginning of the year, or indicative of the future results of
the combined Group. The impact of the Protocol First acquisition on the 2021 results for the Pharmaceuticals Division and the
Group were not material.

The business process transformation to simplify system landscapes and streamline process complexity incurred employee-related
costs of CHF 135 million (2021: CHF 85 million) and other reorganisation expenses of CHF 198 million (2021: CHF 116 million).
The transformation is a multi-year cross-divisional programme to drive efficiency gains.
The manufacturing network strategy review in the Pharmaceuticals Division incurred site closure costs of CHF 178 million
(2021: CHF 18 million) related to sites in the US, Switzerland and Germany. Additionally, the Pharmaceuticals Division’s portfolio
prioritisation programme incurred costs of CHF 221 million (2021: none) mainly related to the closure of studies.
In 2021 the major items of global restructuring costs were for employee-related costs from business transformation initiatives
in the Pharmaceuticals Division, strategy plans in the Diagnostics Division, notably in Diabetes Care, and site development at the
Basel/Kaiseraugst site in Switzerland.68 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022

In 2022 impairments for property, plant and equipment were mainly related to global restructuring plans (see Note 7).
In 2021 the Pharmaceuticals Division reported impairment reversals of property, plant and equipment of CHF 108 million, net.
An idle-plant impairment was reversed in the first half of 2021, resulting in an income of CHF 184 million. This was partially
offset by impairments of property, plant and equipment including AT-527-related assets of CHF 38 million. Impairment charges
of CHF 105 million were incurred in the Diagnostics Division, mainly in connection with the at-risk manufacturing ramp-up and
rollout of COVID-19-related products.
In 2022 no reimbursements were received from insurance companies in respect of impairments to property, plant and
equipment (2021: none). In 2022 no borrowing costs were capitalised as property, plant and equipment (2021: none).
At 31 December 2022 machinery and equipment with an original cost of CHF 5.7 billion (2021: CHF 5.6 billion) and a net book
value of CHF 1.6 billion (2021: CHF 1.6 billion) was being leased to third parties (see Note 28).
Capital commitments
The Group has non-cancellable capital commitments for the purchase or construction of property, plant and equipment
totalling CHF 2.6 billion (2021: CHF 1.9 billion).72 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022

Cash-generating units used for allocating goodwill
Pharmaceuticals Division. The basis for the use of the cash-generating units for allocating goodwill in the Pharmaceuticals
Division is as follows:
• Within the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment, goodwill arises from three broad types of transactions:
– Strategic transactions that have a transformative effect across the whole division.
– Technology transactions, where the acquired technologies can have a range of areas of applications.
– Product transactions, where the acquired products typically have more limited synergistic benefits outside of the immediate
product therapeutic area.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from strategic transactions is the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating
segment.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from technology transactions is also the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating
segment. However, if the acquired technologies permanently cease to operate then this will be treated as a disposal of the
business; in such cases the goodwill will be deemed to have been disposed of and will be fully impaired.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from product transactions is the smallest identifiable group of assets related
to the revenues and related costs that arise from the development and commercialisation of the product(s) in question. Where
there are synergistic benefits to other products in the same therapeutic area, then the revenues, costs and corresponding
assets of these other products are also taken into account. If the acquired products permanently cease to generate
economic benefits then this will be treated as a disposal of the business; in such cases the goodwill will be deemed to have
been disposed of and will be fully impaired.
• Chugai is a separate operating segment in the Group’s financial reporting and a separate cash-generating unit to which
goodwill is allocated.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 73
The Group allocated the goodwill in the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment as listed below.
• Strategic transactions consist of Genentech (1990/1999), Foundation Medicine (2015), Flatiron Health (2018) and Spark
Therapeutics (2019).
• Technology transactions consist of Therapeutic Human Polyclonals (2007), Dutalys (2014) and Santaris (2014).
• Product transactions consist of GlycArt (2005) and Tanox (2007).
Diagnostics Division. The basis for the use of the cash-generating units for allocating goodwill in the Diagnostics Division is as
follows:
• Within the Diagnostics Division, goodwill arises from three broad types of transactions:
– Strategic transactions that have a transformative effect across the whole division.
– Technology transactions, where the acquired technologies can have a range of areas of applications.
– Product transactions, where the acquired products either have synergistic benefits across the wider business or where they
have more limited synergistic benefits outside of the immediate product therapeutic area.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from strategic transactions will be the Diagnostics Division.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from technology transactions will be either the Diagnostics customer areas
or the Diabetes Care customer area. However, if the acquired technologies permanently cease to operate then this will be
treated as a disposal of the business; in such cases the goodwill will be deemed to have been disposed of and will be fully
impaired.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from product transactions will be the smallest identifiable group of
assets related to the revenues and related costs that arise from the development and commercialisation of the product(s)
in question. Where there are synergistic benefits to other products in the same business, then the revenues, costs and
corresponding assets of these other products will also be taken into account and the cash-generating unit will be either the
Diagnostics customer areas or the Diabetes Care customer area. If the acquired products permanently cease to generate
economic benefits then this will be treated as a disposal of the business; in such cases the goodwill will be deemed to have
been disposed of and will be fully impaired.
The Group allocated the goodwill in the Roche Diagnostics operating segment as listed below.
• Strategic transactions consist of Corange/Boehringer Mannheim (1997).
• Technology transactions consist of Viewics (2017) in the Diagnostics customer areas and mySugr (2017) in the Diabetes Care
customer area.
• Product transactions in the Diagnostics customer areas consist of Igen (2004), BioVeris (2007), Ventana (2008), PVT (2011),
IQuum (2014), GenMark (2021) and TIB Molbiol (2021).
• Product transactions in the Diabetes Care customer area consist of Disetronic (2003) and Medingo (2010).

There were no impairments of goodwill during 2021.74 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
Value in use
Value in use is calculated using a discounted expected cash flow approach, with a post-tax discount rate applied to the
projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash flows and terminal value. The discount rate is the Group’s weighted average cost of
capital as the cash-generating units have integrated operations across large parts of the Group. It is derived from a capital
asset pricing model using data from capital markets, including government twenty-year bonds. For assessing value in use, the
cash flow projections are based on the most recent long-term forecasts approved by management. The long-term forecasts
include management’s latest estimates on sales volume and pricing, as well as production and other operating costs and
assume no significant changes in the organisation. Other key assumptions used in the calculations are the period of cash flow
projections included in the long-term forecasts, the terminal value growth rate and the discount rate.
Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations
2022 2021
Period of Terminal Period of Terminal
cash flow value Discount rate cash flow value Discount rate

Pharmaceuticals Division 5 years n/a 7.5% 5 years n/a 5.8%
Diagnostics Division 5 years 1.5% 7.5% 5 years 1.5% 5.8%
For goodwill relating to Roche Pharmaceuticals product transactions, product-specific periods of cash flow projections
are used. For cash-generating units with a terminal value growth, the respective rate does not exceed the long-term projected
growth rate for the relevant market.
Fair value less costs of disposal
For goodwill arising from the Chugai acquisition, the fair value less costs of disposal is determined with reference to the publicly
quoted price of Chugai shares.
Sensitivity analysis
Management has performed sensitivity analyses for Roche Pharmaceuticals and the Diagnostics Division, which increased the
discount rate by 1% combined with decreasing the forecast cash flows by 5%, and for Chugai, which decreased the publicly
quoted share prices by 5%. The results of the sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the above changes in the key assumptions
would not cause the carrying values of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amounts at 31 December 2022.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 75

Internally generated intangible assets
At 31 December 2022 internally generated intangible assets relating to commercial software amounted to CHF 32 million
(2021: CHF 20 million) and are included in other intangibles. Other than that the Group has no internally generated intangible
assets from development as the criteria for the recognition as an asset are not met.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
The Group currently has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 77
Intangible assets not available for use
These mostly represent in-process research and development assets acquired either through in-licensing arrangements,
business combinations, asset acquisitions or separate purchases. On 31 December 2022 approximately 88% (2021: 74%)
of the projects in the Pharmaceuticals Division had known decision points within the next twelve months which, under certain
circumstances, could lead to impairment. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the research and development processes,
intangible assets not available for use are particularly at risk of impairment if the project is not expected to result in a
commercialised product.
Intangible asset impairment
Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposal. Factors such as the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence or lower-
than-anticipated sales for products with capitalised rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
Impairment charges – 2022
Pharmaceuticals Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 2,837 million were recorded. The major items related to:
• A charge of CHF 663 million for the full impairment of the in-licensed Gavreto product intangible asset due to lower sales
expectations. The asset concerned, which was being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 519 million for the partial impairment of the product intangible asset for SPK-8011, a novel gene therapy for
the treatment of haemophilia A that was acquired as part of the Spark Therapeutics acquisition. This impairment was a result
of revised sales expectations. The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was written down to its estimated
recoverable amount of CHF 530 million.
• A charge of CHF 362 million for the full impairment of the product intangible asset for PRM-151, a novel anti-fibrotic
immunomodulator for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis that was acquired as part of the Promedior acquisition.

assessment. The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 19 million due to the decision to stop a collaboration project with an alliance partner. The asset concerned,
which was being amortised, was fully written down.
• The previously recorded impairment for a compound in development was partially reversed and an income of CHF 101 million
was recorded for this. The asset concerned was written up to its estimated recoverable value of CHF 110 million following a
clinical data assessment. The asset concerned is not yet being amortised.
• Following a clinical data assessment in the first half of 2021, an impairment charge of CHF 76 million was recorded for a
compound in development. After a full review of the clinical data results in the second half of 2021 and its impact on the
programme, this impairment was fully reversed.
Potential commitments from alliance collaborations and intangible asset purchase agreements within the next three years
The Group is party to in-licensing and alliance arrangements and intangible asset purchase agreements, including asset
acquisitions. These arrangements and purchase agreements may require the Group to make certain milestone or other similar
payments dependent upon the achievement of agreed objectives or performance targets as defined in the collaboration and
purchase agreements.
The Group’s current estimate of future third-party commitments for such potential payments within the next three years is set
out in the table below. These figures are undiscounted and are not risk-adjusted, meaning that they include all such potential
payments that can arise assuming all projects currently in development are successful. The timing is based on the Group’s
current best estimate. These figures do not include any potential commitments within the Group, such as may arise between the
Roche and Chugai businesses.

In 2022 CHF 1,052 million of provisions were utilised (2021: CHF 1,194 million). This amount is entirely included in the cash flows
from operating activities (2021: CHF 1,166 million). In 2021 the remaining CHF 28 million were included in the cash flows from
business combinations for payments made from deferred and contingent consideration arrangements (see Note 6).84 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
Legal provisions
Legal provisions relate to a number of separate legal matters, including claims arising from trade, in various Group companies.
By their nature the amounts and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict.
As part of the regular review of litigation matters, management has reassessed the provisions recorded for certain litigation
matters. Based on the development of the various litigations, there was a net release of legal provisions of CHF 34 million in
2022 (2021: net increase of CHF 78 million). In 2022 the net income for legal cases included in general and administration were
CHF 25 million (2021: net expenses of CHF 52 million). Details of the major legal cases outstanding are disclosed below.
Environmental provisions
Provisions for environmental matters relate to various separate environmental issues in a number of countries. By their nature
the amounts and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict. At 31 December 2022 significant provisions were discounted
by between 4% and 5% (2021: between 1% and 3%) where the time value of money was material. The effect from the increase
in the discount rates in 2022 was higher than the discount unwind, which resulted in a decrease of provisions in 2022.
The significant provisions relate to the US site in Nutley, New Jersey, which was divested in September 2016, the estimated
remediation costs for a landfill site near Grenzach, Germany, which was used by manufacturing operations that were closed
some years ago, and the estimated remediation costs for the manufacturing site at Clarecastle, Ireland, which was shut down
in the meantime. In 2022 environmental provisions decreased by CHF 73 million, net, mainly due to utilisations and the effects
from higher discount rates. In 2022 the net environmental expenses were CHF 3 million (2021: net expenses of CHF 66 million,
mainly due to an increase of provisions following a reassessment of the expected costs of the environmental remediation at the
Clarecastle site and other matters).
The Group’s procedures on environmental protection are included in the Annual Report on pages 114 to 129. These include the
actions taken by the Group with regard to climate change, notably the Group’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Restructuring provisions
These arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of business undertaken by the Group or the manner
in which business is conducted. Such provisions include only the costs necessarily entailed by the restructuring which are not
associated with the recurring activities of the Group. The timings of these cash outflows are reasonably certain. These provisions
are not discounted as the time value of money is not material in these matters.
In the Pharmaceuticals Division the significant provisions relate to various business transformation initiatives, including the
resourcing flexibility plans and the site development plans at the Basel/Kaiseraugst site, as well as to the redesign and
the strategic realignment of its manufacturing network. In the Diagnostics Division the significant provisions are associated
with programmes to address long-term strategy, while in Corporate they relate to initiatives for the outsourcing of IT and
other functions to shared service centres and external providers. Further details are given in Note 7.
Contingent consideration provisions
The Group is party to certain contingent consideration arrangements arising from business combinations. Significant non-
current provisions are discounted using an average discount rate of 5.3% (2021: 2.7%) where the time value of money is
material. Additional details on measurement and on the total potential payments under these arrangements are provided in
Note 31.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 85
Other provisions
Other provisions relate to the items shown in the table below. With the exception of employee provisions, the timing of cash
outflows is by its nature uncertain.

Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees, to be affected by political,
legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating to environmental protection, in the countries in which
it operates. The industries in which the Group operates are also subject to other risks of various kinds. The nature and frequency
of these developments and events, not all of which are covered by insurance, as well as their effect on future operations and
earnings, are not predictable.
The Group has entered into in-licensing and alliance arrangements and intangible asset purchase agreements, including asset
acquisitions, in order to gain access to potential new products or to utilise other companies to help develop the Group’s own
potential new products. These arrangements and purchase agreements may require the Group to make certain milestone or
other similar payments dependent upon the achievement of agreed objectives or performance targets as defined in the
collaboration and purchase agreements. The Group’s current estimate of future third-party commitments for such potential
payments within the next three years are given in Note 10.86 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
Legal cases
At 31 December 2022 legal provisions included provisions for legal cases of CHF 235 million (2021: CHF 269 million), mainly
related to legal cases in the Pharmaceuticals Division of CHF 21 million (2021: CHF 49 million) and in the Diagnostics Division
of CHF 214 million (2021: CHF 220 million). Provisions have been recorded, and in some cases settled, mainly relating to Meso,
a Diagnostics legal case, and to the Pharmaceuticals legal matters listed below.
Avastin/Lucentis investigations. On 14 February 2013 the Italian Antitrust Authority (‘AGCM’) announced an investigation
to determine whether Roche, Genentech and Novartis had entered into an agreement to restrict competition in the Italian
market for drugs, with reference in particular to Avastin (marketed by Roche) and Lucentis (marketed by Novartis). Avastin
and Lucentis are two different drugs that were developed and approved for different therapeutic purposes and contain
different active pharmaceutical ingredients. On 5 March 2014 the AGCM issued a verdict that alleges that Roche and Novartis
colluded to artificially differentiate Avastin and Lucentis in order to foster the sales of Lucentis in Italy. The AGCM fined Roche
EUR 90.5 million and Novartis EUR 92 million. Roche appealed the AGCM verdict to the Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale del
Lazio (‘TAR’). On 2 December 2014 the TAR upheld the decision by the AGCM. Roche appealed the verdict of the TAR to the
Consiglio di Stato. In July 2014 Roche paid the EUR 90.5 million fine under protest to avoid additional penalty fees and recorded
an expense within general and administration. On 23 January 2018 the European Court of Justice rendered its decision on five
questions which had been referred to the European Court of Justice by the Consiglio di Stato. On 15 July 2019 the Consiglio
di Stato issued the final verdict on the case and upheld the verdicts of both the AGCM and the TAR. Roche filed an appeal with
the Corte Suprema di Cassazione, which was rejected on 5 October 2021. In addition, Roche filed a motion for revocation
with the Consiglio di Stato which is still pending. The hearing will take place on 27 April 2023. The Italian Ministry of Health
and some Italian regions notified the Group of their intention to seek damages related to this matter. On 24 January 2019
the French Competition Authority (‘FCA’) issued a Statement of Objections against Roche, Genentech and Novartis regarding
anticompetitive practices concerning the commercialisation of Avastin and Lucentis in France. The FCA alleges that Roche,
Genentech and Novartis abused their collective dominant position on the French market for the treatment of wet age-related
macular degeneration between 2008 and 2013. On 9 September 2020 the FCA issued a decision finding that Roche, Genentech
and Novartis had infringed competition law and imposed a fine of EUR 60 million against Roche and Genentech. Roche and
Genentech appealed this decision. On 10 February 2022 there was a hearing before the Paris Court of Appeal. The ruling is
expected to be issued on 16 February 2023. At 31 December 2020 a liability was held for the amount of the fine, which was
included in accounts payable within the line item other payables (see Note 17). In January 2021 the fine was paid under protest
to avoid additional penalty fees. In September 2021 Roche received an administrative fine letter from the Turkish Competition
Authority (‘TCA’). In its investigation the TCA alleges that Roche and Novartis entered into a cartel aiming at preventing off-label
applications of Avastin in order to foster on-label applications of Lucentis. In October 2021 the fine of Turkish lira 85 million
was paid under protest to avoid additional penalty fees. Roche filed an appeal against the decision. In addition, the Group is
challenging policies and regulations allowing off-label/unlicensed use and reimbursement for economic reasons in various
countries. The Group is vigorously defending itself in these matters. The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at
this time.
Average Wholesale Prices litigation. Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. (‘HLR’) and Roche Laboratories Inc. (‘RLI’), along with
approximately 50 other brand and generic pharmaceutical companies, have been named as defendants in several legal actions
in the US relating to the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs and state Medicaid reimbursement. The primary allegation in these
litigations is that the pharmaceutical companies misrepresented or otherwise reported inaccurate Average Wholesale Prices
(‘AWP’) and/or Wholesale Acquisition Costs (‘WAC’) for their drugs, which prices were allegedly relied upon by the states in
calculating Medicaid reimbursements to entities such as retail pharmacies. The states, through their respective Attorney
General, are seeking repayment of the amounts they claim were over-reimbursed. The time period associated with these cases
is 1991 through 2005. At 31 December 2021 HLR and RLI were defending one AWP action filed in the state of New Jersey.
In September 2022 this last case was dismissed following a settlement. This matter is now concluded.
Boniva litigation. Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. (‘HLR’), Genentech and various other Roche affiliates (collectively ‘Roche’) have
been named as defendants in numerous legal actions in the US and one now dismissed case in Canada relating to the post-
menopausal osteoporosis medication Boniva. In these litigations, the plaintiffs allege that Boniva caused either osteonecrosis
of the jaw or atypical femoral fractures. At 31 December 2022 Roche was defending approximately 245 actions involving
approximately 285 plaintiffs brought in federal and state courts throughout the US for personal injuries allegedly resulting
from the use of Boniva. All of these cases are in the early discovery stages of litigation. Individual trial results depend on a
variety of factors, including many that are unique to the particular case. Roche is vigorously defending itself in these matters.
The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 87
Meso litigation. In February 2017 Roche Diagnostics Corporation (‘Roche’) filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District
of Delaware against Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC (‘Meso’). This is a patent infringement case involving certain US patents
owned by BioVeris Corporation (‘BioVeris’), a company acquired by the Group in 2007. Meso holds a limited exclusive licence
to use certain aspects of the electrochemiluminescence (‘ECL’) detection technology. Roche and Meso disagree on the scope
of the licence. The lawsuit is seeking a declaratory judgment to get judicial clarification that Roche is not infringing Meso’s
licence. On 25 November 2019 the jury found that Roche’s use of the patents infringed the scope of Meso’s licence. There
was no injunction granted and the jury awarded Meso USD 137 million in damages. In 2020 post-trial motions were filed by
both parties and Meso moved for enhancement, pre-judgment interest and post-judgment royalties. The court hearing took
place on 6 May 2020. On 23 December 2020 the US District Court issued the final order of judgment in which the jury award
was confirmed and Meso’s request for enhanced damages was denied. The Group appealed this decision. On 8 April 2022
the US Court of Appeal issued its ruling. It reversed the induced infringement decision and vacated the damages award.
The US Court of Appeal also affirmed that Roche directly infringed one patent and vacated the District Court’s decision on
23 December 2020 of non-infringement of three other patents. The case was remanded back to the District Court for a new
damages trial, which is ongoing. The Group is vigorously defending itself in this matter.
In addition, the Pharmaceuticals legal cases listed below do not currently have provisions recorded, but there are potential
future obligations which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events or where the
obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
Hemlibra litigation. On 4 May 2017 Baxalta Inc. and Baxalta GmbH (both together ‘Baxalta’), subsidiaries of Takeda
Pharmaceutical Company Limited, filed a patent infringement and declaratory judgment of patent infringement suit in the
US District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that Genentech and Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (‘Chugai’) currently
or imminently would manufacture, use, sell, offer for sale, or import into the US Hemlibra, which would infringe Baxalta’s
US Patent No. 7,033,590. Baxalta is seeking a judgment of infringement, injunctive and monetary relief, attorneys’ fees, costs
and expenses. On 11 May 2017 Genentech was served with the complaint. Genentech’s response and counterclaims to the
complaint were filed on 30 June 2017. On 19 June 2017 Chugai waived service. On 13 September 2017 Chugai filed a motion to
dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. On 14 December 2017 Baxalta filed a request for a preliminary injunction
against Genentech only, in which some inhibitor patients would not be subject to any injunction. A hearing was held in the
US District Court for the District of Delaware on 13 and 14 June 2018 and during that hearing Baxalta withdrew its request for
a preliminary injunction as to the inhibitor patients. On 25 June 2018 Baxalta submitted a new proposed preliminary injunction
order, in which Genentech would be permitted to sell Hemlibra to all inhibitor patients, all non-inhibitor patients currently on
Hemlibra whether through clinical trials or not, and selected non-inhibitor patients who have an additional ‘medically diagnosed
condition’ which rendered factor VIII therapies impracticable. On 7 August 2018 the US District Court ruled against Baxalta,
denying their request for an injunction. On 19 September 2018 Chugai was dismissed from this case. On 1 February 2019
the US District Court issued a final judgment in favour of Genentech stating that Hemlibra does not infringe Baxalta’s patent
based on the Court’s definition of key terms related to the patent. On 8 February 2019 Baxalta appealed this decision. On
27 August 2020 the Appeals Court reversed the claim construction ruling of the US District Court in favour of Genentech and
remanded the case back to the US District Court. On 3 September 2021 Genentech filed a motion for summary judgment on
multiple grounds. On 19 November 2021 the US District Court heard Genentech’s motions for summary judgment of invalidity,
non-infringement under the doctrine of equivalence, and no wilful infringement. On 13 January 2022 the US District Court
granted Genentech’s motion for summary judgment of no enablement, which means that the previously scheduled trial will be
cancelled. Baxalta appealed this ruling with a decision expected in 2023. The Group is vigorously defending itself in this matter.
The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Iraqi Ministry of Health. In October 2017 F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (‘FHLR’), Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. (‘HLR’) and Genentech
and certain other pharmaceutical and/or medical device companies were named as defendants in a complaint filed in the
Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, US, on behalf of US service members and their relatives who allege that
they were killed or injured in Iraq between 2005 and 2009 (the ‘Iraq lawsuit’). The complaint alleges that the defendants
violated the US Anti-Terrorism Act and various state laws by providing funding for terrorist organisations through their sales
practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and/or medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health. In addition FHLR
received an inquiry in July 2018 from the US Department of Justice in connection with an anti-corruption investigation relating
to activities in Iraq, including interactions with the Iraqi government and certain of the same matters alleged in the Iraq lawsuit.
On 29 October 2019 the US Department of Justice closed its inquiry against FHLR. On 17 July 2020 the Federal District Court
granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss. The plaintiffs appealed this decision. On 4 January 2022 the US Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the decision of the Federal District Court and remanded the case for further
proceedings. Defendants filed petitions for rehearing en banc by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
which remain pending. The Group is vigorously defending itself in this matter. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined
at this time.88 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
Tamiflu Qui tam litigation. In 2019, Roche Holding Ltd (‘Roche Holding’), Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. (‘HLR’) and Genentech, Inc.
(‘Genentech’) were served with a lawsuit filed by a relator in the US District Court for the District of Maryland under the qui
tam (whistleblower) provisions of the False Claims Act. The lawsuit was originally filed under seal years earlier on behalf of
the US government and various US state governments. The lawsuit alleges certain improper conduct by the Group with
respect to sales of Tamiflu to the US government and various US state governments. The US Department of Justice declined to
intervene in the lawsuit. On 17 January 2020 the Group filed a motion to dismiss. On 28 September 2020 the plaintiff dismissed
the complaint as to Roche Holding and Genentech and the District Court denied HLR’s motion for summary judgment. On
4 November 2022 the US Department of Justice filed a motion to dismiss the claim. The motion has been stayed pending a
decision from the US Supreme Court on a related matter. The Group is vigorously defending itself in this matter. The outcome
of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Novartis litigation related to Cabilly royalties. On 25 May 2021 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Inc. and Novartis Pharma
AG (collectively ‘Novartis’) filed a lawsuit against Genentech, Inc. (‘Genentech’) in California state court of San Mateo County.
Novartis alleges that it mistakenly overpaid, and is entitled to the return of, certain Cabilly royalties for its products Cosentyx
and Ilaris, totalling USD 210 million. Following the expiry of the Cabilly patent, Genentech and Novartis have had discussions
regarding Cabilly royalties owed for Cosentyx and Ilaris manufactured in, or imported into, the US prior to patent expiry but sold
after patent expiry. On 24 June 2021 Genentech filed a notice of removal, seeking to move the case from state court to federal
court. On 1 July 2021 Genentech filed a motion to dismiss all the claims on various grounds. In response to Genentech’s motion,
Novartis filed an amended complaint on 20 August 2021. On 3 September 2021 Genentech filed a motion to dismiss the
amended complaint on similar grounds. On 11 February 2022 Novartis and Genentech engaged in a voluntary mediation, which
did not result in a settlement outcome. On 6 October 2022 there was a case management conference. The court unilaterally
decided to re-calendar oral argument on Genentech’s motion to dismiss which will be heard in February 2023. The Group is
vigorously defending itself in this matter. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Herceptin investigation. On 8 February 2022 the South African Competition Commission (‘Commission’) filed a referral with
the Competition Tribunal for prosecution of Roche Holding Ltd, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Roche Products (Pty) Ltd
(together ‘Roche’) for alleged excessive pricing of trastuzumab (Herceptin) in contravention of the South African Competition
Act. The Commission’s referral affidavit also alleges that the excessive price of Herceptin constitutes a violation of basic
human rights including the right of access to healthcare enshrined in South Africa’s Bill of Rights as it denies access to life-
saving medicine for women living with breast cancer. The alleged excessive pricing of Herceptin by Roche took place between
January 2011 and November 2020 in the South African private healthcare sector and in the South African public healthcare
sector during the period from November 2015 to July 2020. The Commission has asked the Competition Tribunal to impose
a penalty against Roche. On 14 October 2022 Roche submitted its replies to the Competition Tribunal. The Group is vigorously
defending itself in this matter. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
University of Pennsylvania litigation. On 31 January 2022 the University of Pennsylvania filed a patent litigation action in
the US against Genentech, Inc. (‘Genentech’) based on a claim that Herceptin, Perjeta, Phesgo and Herceptin Hylecta would
infringe their US Patent No. 7,625,558 (the ’558 patent). According to the complaint, the ’558 patent generally relates to

Share repurchase and share capital reduction
On 26 November 2021, an Extraordinary General Meeting of Roche shareholders approved a reduction of the share capital
of Roche Holding Ltd, which is the Group’s parent company, by CHF 53.3 million from CHF 160.0 million to CHF 106.7 million
through the cancellation of all such shares to be repurchased from Novartis. On 6 December 2021, the Roche Group
repurchased 53.3 million Roche shares held by Novartis for a total consideration of CHF 19.0 billion. The repurchased shares
were reported as treasury shares as at 31 December 2021. These shares were cancelled in February 2022 when the necessary
legal procedures had been completed. Upon cancellation of these shares, the share capital of Roche Holding Ltd decreased
by CHF 53.3 million from CHF 160.0 million to CHF 106.7 million. The reduction in the share capital became effective at
the beginning of February 2022, with the entry of the share capital reduction in the commercial register of the Canton of
Basel-Stadt on 3 February 2022 and the publication of the share capital reduction in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce on
8 February 2022. The CHF 19.0 billion credit facility from banks drawn in 2021 to finance the share repurchase was fully repaid
by May 2022, partly from the proceeds from the new debt issuances and partly from internal cash generation (see Note 21).
Share capital
Following the share capital reduction described above, at 31 December 2022 the authorised and issued share capital of
Roche Holding Ltd, which is the Group’s parent company, consisted of 106,691,000 shares with a nominal value of CHF 1.00
each (31 December 2021: 160,000,000 shares, thereof 53,309,000 shares held by the Group as treasury shares that were
cancelled in February 2022). The shares are bearer shares and the Group does not maintain a register of shareholders. At
31 December 2022, based on information supplied to the Group, a shareholder group with pooled voting rights owned
72,018,000 shares representing 67.50% of the issued shares (31 December 2021: 72,018,000 shares representing 45.01%
of the issued shares and, excluding the treasury shares held by the Group that were cancelled in February 2022, 67.50% of the
voting power). These figures do not include any shares without pooled voting rights that are held outside this group by individual
members of the group. On 5 December 2019 the shareholder group announced that it would continue the shareholder pooling
agreement existing since 1948 with a modified shareholder composition. The duration of the pool was extended for an indefinite
period in 2009. At 31 December 2022, based on information supplied to the Group, Ms Maja Oeri, formerly a member of the
pool, held 8,091,900 shares independently of the pool, representing 7.58% of the issued shares (31 December 2021: 8,091,900
shares representing 5.057% of the issued shares and, excluding the treasury shares held by the Group that were cancelled in
February 2022, 7.58% of the voting power). This is further described in Note 32.
Non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
At 31 December 2022, 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities had been authorised and were in issue as in the preceding
year. Under Swiss company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value, are not part of the share capital
and cannot be issued against a contribution which would be shown as an asset in the balance sheet of Roche Holding Ltd.
Each non-voting equity security confers the same rights as any of the shares to participate in the net profit and any remaining
proceeds from liquidation following repayment of the nominal value of the shares and, if any, participation certificates. In
accordance with the law and the Articles of Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd, the Company is entitled at all times to exchange
shares or participation certificates for all or some of the non-voting equity securities without the consent of the bearers
thereof.
Dividends
On 15 March 2022 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of CHF 9.30 per share and non-voting equity
security (2021: CHF 9.10) in respect of the 2021 business year. The distribution to holders of outstanding shares and non-voting
equity securities totalled CHF 7,446 million (2021: CHF 7,773 million) and has been recorded against retained earnings in 2022.
The Board of Directors has proposed dividends for the 2022 business year of CHF 9.50 per share and non-voting equity security.
This dividend proposal is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 14 March 2023. If approved, this would result in
a total distribution to shareholders of CHF 7,688 million.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 97

23. Subsidiaries and associates
Chugai
Effective 1 October 2002 the Roche Group and Chugai completed an alliance to create a leading research-driven Japanese
pharmaceutical company, which was formed by the merger of Chugai and Roche’s Japanese pharmaceuticals subsidiary,
Nippon Roche. The merged company is known as Chugai.
Consolidated subsidiary. Chugai is a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group. This is based on the Group’s interest in Chugai
at 31 December 2022 of 61.1% (2021: 61.2%) and the Roche relationship with Chugai that is founded on the Basic Alliance,
Licensing and Research Collaboration Agreements.
The common stock of Chugai is publicly traded and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the stock code ‘TSE:4519’.
Chugai prepares financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that are filed on
a quarterly basis with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to certain consolidation entries there are minor differences between
Chugai’s stand-alone IFRS results and the results of Chugai as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS.

(2021: CHF 319 million) and have been recorded against non-controlling interests (see Note 24). Dividends paid by Chugai
to Roche are eliminated on consolidation as intercompany items.
Roche’s relationship with Chugai. Chugai has entered into certain agreements with Roche, which are discussed below:
(1) Basic Alliance Agreement – As part of the Basic Alliance Agreement signed in December 2001 and partially revised in
July 2022, Roche and Chugai entered into certain arrangements covering the future operation and governance of Chugai.
Amongst other matters these cover the following areas:
• The structuring of the alliance.
• Roche’s rights as a shareholder.
• Roche’s rights to nominate members of Chugai’s Board of Directors.
• Certain limitations to Roche’s ability to buy or sell Chugai’s common stock.
Chugai issues additional shares of common stock in connection with its convertible debt and equity compensation plans, and
may issue additional shares for other purposes. If this occurs, Chugai will guarantee Roche’s right to maintain its shareholding
percentage in Chugai by allowing Roche to exercise its pre-emptive right or other rights.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 99
(2) Licensing Agreements – Under the Japan Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in December 2001, Chugai has exclusive rights
to market Roche’s pharmaceutical products in Japan. Chugai has the right of first refusal on the development and marketing in
Japan of all development compounds advanced by Roche.
The Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement (excluding Japan and South Korea) signed in May 2002 was revised and the
Amended and Restated Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement (excluding Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) was signed
in August 2014. Under this Agreement Chugai shall offer and Roche has the right of first refusal on the development and
marketing of Chugai’s development compounds in markets outside Japan, excluding South Korea and Taiwan.
Further to these agreements, Roche and Chugai have signed a series of separate agreements for certain specific products.
Depending on the specific circumstances and the terms of the agreement, this may result in payments on an arm’s length basis
between Roche and Chugai, for any or all of the following matters:
• Upfront payments, if a right of first refusal to license a product is exercised.
• Milestone payments, dependent upon the achievement of agreed performance targets.
• Royalties on future product sales.
These specific product agreements may also cover the manufacture and supply of the respective products to meet the other
party’s clinical and/or commercial requirements on an arm’s length basis.
(3) Research Collaboration Agreements – Roche and Chugai have entered into research collaboration agreements in the areas
of small-molecule synthetic drug research and biotechnology-based drug discovery.
Associates
On 21 December 2021 the Group acquired an interest in Freenome Holdings, Inc. (‘Freenome’), a privately owned
US company based in South San Francisco, California. At 31 December 2022 the Group’s interest in Freenome was 16.4%
(31 December 2021: 16.3%). This investment has been assessed and is treated as an associate of the Group. The Group
accounts for Freenome using the equity method based on Freenome’s financial statements that are made available to the
Group. The carrying value of the Group’s share of Freenome’s net assets, an asset of CHF 299 million (31 December 2021:
CHF 329 million), is included in other non-current assets (see Note 15). The Group’s share of Freenome’s results, a loss of
CHF 40 million (2021: nil), is included in other financial income (expense) (see Note 4).100 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022

26. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group’s objective is to provide attractive and competitive post-employment benefits to employees, while at the same
time ensuring that the various plans are appropriately financed and managing any potential impacts on the Group’s long-
term financial position. Most employees are covered by pension plans sponsored by Group companies. The nature of such
plans varies according to legal regulations, fiscal requirements and market practice in the countries in which the employees
are employed. Post-employment benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive
obligation to pay further contributions. All other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’.
Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans are funded through payments by employees and by the Group to funds administered by third parties.
The Group’s expenses for these plans were CHF 452 million (2021: CHF 419 million). No assets or liabilities are recognised in
the Group’s balance sheet in respect of such plans, apart from regular prepayments and accruals of the contributions withheld
from employees’ wages and salaries and of the Group’s contributions. The Group’s major defined contribution plan is the US
Roche 401(k) Savings Plan.
Defined benefit plans
Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by payments from Group companies and by
employees. In some cases, notably for the major defined benefit plans in Germany, the plans are unfunded and the Group pays
pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources. Plans are usually governed by a senior governing body,
such as a Board of Trustees, which is typically composed of both employee and employer representatives. Funding of these
plans is determined by local regulations using independent actuarial valuations. Separate independent actuarial valuations are
prepared in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 for use in the Group’s financial statements. The Group’s major pension
plans are located in Switzerland, the US and Germany, which in total account for 87% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation
(2021: 85%).
Pension plans in Switzerland. Current pension arrangements for employees in Switzerland are made through plans
governed by the Swiss Federal Occupational Old Age, Survivors and Disability Pension Act (‘BVG’). The Group’s pension plans
are administered by separate legal foundations, which are funded by regular employee and company contributions. The final
benefit is contribution based with certain minimum guarantees. Due to these minimum guarantees, the Swiss plans are treated
as defined benefit plans for the purposes of these IFRS financial statements, although they have many of the characteristics
of defined contribution plans. Where there is an underfunding, this may be remedied by various measures such as increasing
employee and company contributions, lowering the interest rate on retirement account balances, reducing prospective benefits
and a suspension of the early withdrawal facility.
Pension plans in the US. The Group’s major defined benefit plans in the US have been closed to new members since 2007.
New employees in the US now join the defined contribution plan. The largest of the remaining defined benefit plans are funded
pension plans together with smaller unfunded supplementary retirement plans. The benefits are based on the highest average
annual rate of earnings during a specified period and length of employment. The plans are non-contributory for employees,
with the Group making periodic contributions to the plans. Where there is an underfunding, this would normally be remedied by
additional company contributions. In 2022 and 2021 no such contributions were made by the Group.
Pension plans in Germany. The Group’s major pension arrangements in Germany are governed by the Occupational Pensions
Act (‘BetrAVG’). These plans are unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial
resources. These plans are non-contributory for employees. The benefits are based on final salary and length of employment.
These plans have been closed to new members since 2007. They have been replaced by a new plan which is funded by regular
employee and company contributions and administered through a contractual trust agreement. The final benefit of the
unfunded plan is contribution based with a minimum guarantee. Due to this minimum guarantee, this plan is treated as a defined
benefit plan for the purposes of these IFRS financial statements, although it has many of the characteristics of a defined
contribution plan.102 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
Pension plans in the Rest of the World. These represent approximately 9% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation (2021: 10%)
and consist of a number of smaller plans in various countries. Of these the largest are the pension plans at Chugai, which
are independently managed by Chugai, and the main pension plan in the United Kingdom. In 2022 Chugai has made additional
voluntary contributions of JPY 1.3 billion to its pension plans (2021: JPY 1.2 billion). The Chugai plans are fully described in
Chugai’s own IFRS financial statements. The UK pension plan is funded by regular employee and company contributions, with
benefits based on final salary and length of employment. This plan has been closed to new members since 2003 and has been
replaced with a defined contribution plan.
Other post-employment benefit (‘OPEB’) plans. These represent approximately 4% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation
(2021: 5%) and consist of post-employment healthcare and life insurance schemes, mainly in the US. These plans are mainly
unfunded and/or are contributory for employees, with the Group reimbursing retired employees directly from its own financial
resources. The Group’s major OPEB plans in the US have been closed to new members since 2011. Part of the costs of these
plans is reimbursable under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. There is no statutory
funding requirement for these plans. The Group is funding these plans to the extent that it is tax efficient. In 2022 contributions
of USD 33 million were made by the Group to these plans (2021: none). At 31 December 2022 the IFRS funding status was 62%
(2021: 65%), including reimbursement rights, for the funded OPEB plans in the US.

Funding status
The funding of the Group’s various defined benefit plans is the responsibility of the respective senior governing body, such
as a Board of Trustees, and the sponsoring employer, and is managed based on local statutory valuations, which follow the
legislation and requirements of the respective jurisdiction in which the plan is established. Qualified independent actuaries
carry out statutory actuarial valuations on a regular basis. The actuarial assumptions determining the funding status on
the statutory basis are regularly assessed by the local senior governing body. The funding status is closely monitored at a
corporate level. The unfunded plans are mainly those in the Group’s German affiliates, where the fully reserved pension
obligations are used for self-financing of the local affiliate’s operations.
The IFRS funding status of the funded defined benefit plans increased to 113% (2021: 105%).
Reimbursement rights are linked to the post-employment medical plans in the US and represent the expected reimbursement of
the medical expenditure provided under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 103

Plan assets
The responsibility for the investment strategies of funded plans is with the respective senior governance body, such as the
Board of Trustees. Asset-liability studies are performed regularly for all major pension plans. These studies examine the
obligations from post-employment benefit plans and evaluate various investment strategies with respect to key financial
measures such as expected returns, expected risks, expected contributions, and expected funded status of the plan in an
interdependent way. The goal of an asset-liability study is to select an appropriate asset allocation for the funds held within
the plan. The investment strategy is developed to optimise expected returns, to manage risks and to contain fluctuations
in the statutory funded status. Asset-liability studies include strategies to match the cash flows of the assets with the plan
obligations. The Group currently does not use longevity swaps to manage longevity risk.
Plan assets are managed using internal and external asset managers. The actual performance is continually monitored by
the pension fund governance bodies as well as being closely monitored at a corporate level. In these financial statements
the difference between the interest income and actual return on plan assets is a remeasurement that is recorded directly
to other comprehensive income. In 2022 the actual return on plan assets was a loss of CHF 2,256 million (2021: gain of
CHF 1,264 million), which excludes the actual return on reimbursement rights.
The recognition of plan assets is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available from refunds from the plans
or reductions in future contributions to the plans. A limit on asset recognition arose during 2022 as a result of a surplus, based
on current market assumptions, in certain Swiss pension plans that was not recognisable under IFRS. The adjustment arising
from the limit on the recognition of assets for defined benefit plans is recorded in other comprehensive income within equity.
In 2022, this adjustment was CHF 1,523 million (2021: CHF 3 million).104 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022

Assets are invested in a variety of different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return as follows:
• Equity and debt securities which mainly have quoted market prices (Level 1 fair value hierarchy).
• Property which is primarily in private and commercial property funds which mainly have other observable inputs
(Level 2 fair value hierarchy).
• Cash and money market instruments which are mainly invested with financial institutions with a credit rating no lower than A.
• Other investments which mainly consist of alternatives, mortgages, commodities and insurance contracts. These are used for
risk management purposes and mainly have other observable inputs (Level 2 fair value hierarchy) and unobservable inputs
(Level 3 fair value hierarchy).
Included within the fair value of plan assets are the Group’s shares and non-voting securities with a fair value of CHF 147 million
(2021: CHF 191 million) and debt instruments issued by the Group with a fair value of CHF 15 million (2021: CHF 13 million).Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 105
Defined benefit obligation
The defined benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method. This reflects service rendered by employees
to the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the
present value of benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth and mortality rates. The present value of the defined benefit
obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds
or government bonds in countries where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. The corporate or government bonds
are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and have maturity terms approximating to the terms of the
related pension obligation.
The Group’s final salary-based defined benefit pension plans in the US, Germany and the United Kingdom have been closed
to new participants. Active employees that had been members of these pension plans at the time these were closed to new
participants continue to accrue benefits in the final salary-based defined benefit pension plans. New employees in the US and
UK now join the Group’s defined contribution plans, while new employees in Germany join the contribution-based plan with a
minimum guarantee. As a result, the proportion of the defined benefit obligation which relates to these closed plans is expected
to decrease in the future. The defined benefit pension plans in Switzerland, where the final benefit is contribution based with a
minimum guarantee, remain open to new employees.

Actuarial assumptions
The actuarial assumptions used in these financial statements are based on the requirements set out in IAS 19 ‘Employee
Benefits’. They are unbiased and mutually compatible estimates of variables that determine the ultimate cost of providing post-
employment benefits. They are set on an annual basis by local management, based on advice from actuaries, and are subject
to approval by corporate management and the Group’s actuaries. Actuarial assumptions consist of demographic assumptions
on matters such as mortality and employee turnover, and financial assumptions on matters such as interest rates, salary and
benefit levels, inflation rates and costs of medical benefits. The actuarial assumptions vary based upon local economic and
social conditions. The actuarial assumptions used in the various statutory valuations may differ from these based on local legal
and regulatory requirements.
Demographic assumptions. The most significant demographic assumptions relate to mortality rates. The Group’s actuaries
use mortality tables which take into account historic patterns and expected changes, such as further increases in longevity.
Rates of employee turnover, disability and early retirement are based on historical behaviour. The average life expectancy
assumed now for an individual at the age of 65 is as follows:
Defined benefit plans: average life expectancy at the age of 65 for major schemes in years

Germany Heubeck tables 2018 G projected with CMI model 19.6 19.6 23.0 23.0
In 2022 the mortality assumptions used for the pension plans in Switzerland were based on BVG 2020 (2021: BVG 2020)
applying the Continuous Mortality Investigation (‘CMI’) model. A long-term rate of 1.25% (2021: 1.25%) was used for longevity
improvements.
The Group used as mortality assumptions for the pension plans in Germany Heubeck tables 2018 G applying the CMI model with
a long-term rate of 1.25% for longevity improvements (2021: 1.25%).
Financial assumptions. These are based on market expectations for the period over which the obligations are to be settled.
The assumptions used in the actuarial valuations are shown below.

Ultimate medical cost trend rate (in 2040) 4.00% 4.00% – 4.00% 4.00% 4.00% – 4.00%
Discount rates are determined with reference to interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds in
countries where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. Expected rates of salary increases are based on expected
inflation rates with an adjustment to reflect the Group’s latest expectation of long-term real salary increases taking into
account expected inflation rates, amongst other factors. Expected rates of pension increases are generally linked to the
expected inflation rate or the funding status of the plan. Expected inflation rates are derived by looking at the level of inflation
implied by the financial markets in conjunction with the economists’ price inflation forecasts, historic price inflation as well as
other economic variables and circumstances. Medical cost trend rates take into account the benefits set out in the plan terms
and expected future changes in medical costs. Since the Group’s major post-employment medical plans are for US employees,
these rates are driven by developments in the US.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 107
Sensitivity analysis. The measurement of the net defined benefit obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount
rate, inflation rate, expected mortality and medical cost trend rate assumptions. The following table summarises the impact of a
change in those assumptions on the present value of the defined benefit obligation.

Immediate medical cost trend rate
– 1.00% increase 72 109
– 1.00% decrease (61) (91)
Each sensitivity analysis considers the change in one assumption at a time leaving the other assumptions unchanged.
This approach shows the isolated effect of changing one individual assumption but does not take into account that some
assumptions are related. The method used to carry out the sensitivity analysis is the same as in the prior year.
Cash flows
The Group incurred cash flows from its defined benefit plans as shown in the table below.

Employer contributions, net of reimbursements – funded plans (461) (413)
Benefits paid – unfunded plans (194) (206)
Total cash inflows (outflows) (655) (619)
Based on the most recent actuarial valuations, the Group expects that employer contributions for funded plans in 2023 will be
approximately CHF 426 million. No additional voluntary contributions are planned. Benefits paid for unfunded plans in 2023 are
estimated to be approximately CHF 213 million, which mostly relate to the German defined benefit plans.108 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
27. Equity compensation plans
The Group operates several equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Chugai. IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’
requires that the fair value of all equity compensation plan awards granted to employees be estimated at grant date and
recorded as an expense over the vesting period.

Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights. The Group issues Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) to certain
directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The S-SARs give employees the right to receive
non-voting equity securities reflecting the value of any appreciation in the market price of the non-voting equity securities
between the grant date and the exercise date. Under the Roche S-SAR Plan 180 million S-SARs were available for issuance over
a ten-year period from 2013 to 2022. The Roche S-SAR Plan was renewed effective 1 January 2023 and 150 million S-SARs will
be available for issuance over another ten-year period, starting from 2023. The rights, which are non-tradable equity-settled
awards, have a ten-year duration and vest on a phased basis over four years. Rights granted before 2019 have a seven-year
duration and vested on a phased basis over three years. The provisions of the renewed Roche S-SAR Plan are consistent with the
terms of applicable California securities laws. Within the meaning of Section 25102(o) of Title 4 of the California Corporations
Code and Sections 260.140.41 and 260.140.42 of Title 10 of the California Code of Regulations, approval of these Annual
Financial Statements constitutes approval of the Roche S-SAR Plan, which is described in these Annual Financial Statements,

Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan. The Group issues Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) awards to certain directors, management
and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The RSUs, which are non-tradable, represent the right to receive
non-voting equity securities. RSUs vest on a phased basis over four years, subject to performance conditions, if any. RSUs
granted before 2019 vested after a three-year period. There are currently no performance conditions on outstanding RSUs
at 31 December 2022. Under the Roche RSU Plan 20 million non-voting equity securities were available for issuance over
a ten-year period from 2013 to 2022. The Roche RSU Plan was renewed effective 1 January 2023 and 30 million non-voting
equity securities will be available for issuance over another ten-year period, starting from 2023. The Roche RSU Plan also
includes a value adjustment which will be an amount equivalent to the sum of shareholder distributions made by the Group
during the vesting period attributable to the number of non-voting equity securities for which an individual award has been
granted. The provisions of the renewed Roche RSU Plan are consistent with the terms of applicable California securities laws.
Within the meaning of Section 25102(o) of Title 4 of the California Corporations Code and Sections 260.140.41 and 260.140.42

Roche Connect. This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the US and certain other countries,
to make regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting equity securities. It is administered by independent
third parties. The Group contributes to the programme, which allows the employees to purchase non-voting equity securities
at a discount (usually 20%). The administrator purchases the necessary non-voting equity securities directly from the market.
At 31 December 2022 the administrator held 3.7 million non-voting equity securities (2021: 3.4 million). In 2022 the cost of the
plan was CHF 38 million (2021: CHF 36 million).
Roche Option Plan. This programme is used in countries where S-SARs are not used. Awards under this plan give employees
the right to purchase non-voting equity securities at an exercise price specified at the grant date. The options, which are non-
tradable equity-settled awards, have a ten-year duration and vest on a phased basis over four years. Options granted before
2019 have a seven-year duration and vested on a phased basis over three years.

28. Leases
The Group as a lessee
The Group enters into leasing transaction as a lessee mainly for reasons of convenience and flexibility. The Group has good
cash generation ability and it enjoys strong long-term investment grade credit ratings. Therefore it typically does not enter into
leasing arrangements for financing considerations. The main areas of leases that the Group has entered into are for:
• Property – offices and apartments. These are a small number of leases, but represent most of the value.
• Cars – mostly for sales representatives.
• Office equipment – photocopiers and similar.
The right-of-use assets reported for the Group’s leases are shown in the table below.

The maturity analysis of lease liabilities is given in Note 31 in the ‘Liquidity risk’ section.
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are accounted for using the recognition exemption permitted by IFRS 16.
Expenses for short-term leases are recognised on a straight-line basis. These mainly include short-term property leases for
employee apartments. The amount reported in 2022 was CHF 36 million (2021: CHF 37 million). Expenses for leases of low-
value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis. These mainly include certain office equipment. The amount reported in
2022 was CHF 13 million (2021: CHF 15 million).
Expenses for variable lease payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities was CHF 38 million in 2022
(2021: CHF 35 million). In 2022 income from subleasing right-of-use assets was CHF 3 million (2021: no income). In 2022
and 2021 the Group did not enter into any sale and leaseback transactions.
The major cash flows in respect of leases where the Group is the lessee are shown in the table below.

Cash flows from operating activities include cash flows from short-term lease, leases of low-value assets and variable lease
payments. Cash flows from financing activities include the payment of interest and the principal portion of lease liabilities as
well as prepayments made before the lease commencement date.114 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
Leases committed and not yet commenced. In July 2019 Foundation Medicine, Inc. (‘FMI’) entered into a binding lease
agreement with a third party for the lease of laboratory and office space in a building in Boston, US, which is to be constructed
by the landlord at the location currently known as ‘Boston Seaport’. According to the agreement FMI is committed to lease
the building for 15 years. The commencement date of the lease is currently expected to be in the second half of 2023. The
committed future cash outflows related to this agreement are estimated to be approximately USD 561 million based on current
assumptions.
In November 2021 Genentech, Inc. (‘Genentech’) entered into a binding lease agreement with a third party for the lease of
laboratory and office space in a building in South San Francisco, US, which is to be constructed by the landlord at the location
currently known as ‘751 Gateway’. According to the agreement Genentech is committed to lease the building for seven years.
The commencement date of the lease is currently expected to be in the first half of 2024. The committed future cash outflows
related to this agreement are estimated to be approximately USD 117 million based on current assumptions.
The Group as a lessor
In the Diagnostics Division the Group enters into certain contracts which include placement of diagnostics instruments, supply
of reagents and other consumables, and servicing arrangements. Depending upon the term of the agreement, the instrument
placement may result in either a finance lease or an operating lease. The Group performs a thorough customer assessment
before new leasing agreements are signed. Usually the Group also retains rights to terminate or modify contracts if certain
conditions are not met.
Finance leases. Certain assets, mainly diagnostics instruments, are leased to third parties through finance lease arrangements.
Such assets are reported as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Income from finance leases is
recognised as revenue at amounts that represent the fair value of the instrument, which approximates the present value of the
minimum lease payments under the arrangement. Finance income for finance lease arrangements longer than twelve months
is deferred and subsequently recognised based on a pattern that approximates the use of the effective interest method and
recorded in royalty and other operating income.
The following amounts were recorded as income in respect of finance leases.

Operating leases. Certain assets, mainly diagnostics instruments, are leased to third parties through operating lease
arrangements. Income from operating leases is recognised as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term or, when
lease revenue is entirely based on variable lease payments and subject to subsequent reagent sales, as the performance
obligations for reagents are satisfied.
Lease income in 2022 was CHF 787 million (2021: CHF 817 million) and was included in sales. Of this CHF 588 million
(2021: CHF 584 million) relates to variable lease payments not depending upon an index or rate.
Leased assets are reported within property, plant and equipment, as shown in the table below.

30. Statement of cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities arise from the Group’s primary activities in the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics Divisions.
These are calculated using the indirect method by adjusting the Group’s operating profit for any operating income and
expenses that are not cash flows (for example depreciation, amortisation and impairment) in order to derive the cash generated
from operations. This and other operating cash flows are shown in the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flows also
include income taxes paid on all activities.

31. Risk management
Group risk management
Risk management is a fundamental element of the Group’s business practice on all levels and encompasses different types
of risks. At Group level, risk management is an integral part of the long-term forecasting and controlling processes. Material
risks are monitored and regularly discussed with the Corporate Executive Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors.
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising from its underlying operations and corporate finance activities. The
Group’s financial risk exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices
as well as the creditworthiness and the solvency of the Group’s counterparties.
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies reviewed by the boards of directors of Roche and Chugai as
appropriate to their areas of statutory responsibility. These policies cover credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. The policies
provide guidance on risk limits, types of authorised financial instruments and monitoring procedures. As a general principle,
the policies prohibit the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Policy implementation and
day-to-day risk management are carried out by the relevant treasury functions and regular reporting on these risks is performed
by the relevant accounting and controlling functions within Roche and Chugai.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations, causing financial
losses for the Group. The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses of liquid funds deposited with or
invested in such counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering
netting agreements and without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements, is equal to the carrying
value of the Group’s financial assets.
The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the counterparty is unlikely to pay its obligations to the Group in full.
In assessing whether a counterparty is in default, the Group considers both qualitative and quantitative indicators (e.g. overdue
status) that are based on data developed internally and for certain financial assets are also obtained from external sources.
A major part of the Group’s receivables which are past due more than 90 days relate to public customers. Risk of default of
public customers is considered low. The Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging
default criterion is more appropriate for this particular customer segment.
Accounts receivable. At 31 December 2022 the Group had trade receivables of CHF 12.6 billion (2021: CHF 12.0 billion). These
are subject to a policy of active credit risk management which focuses on the assessment of country risk, credit availability,
ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures. The objective of trade receivables management is to maximise
the collection of unpaid amounts.
The Group uses an allowance matrix to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for all trade receivables. The expected
credit loss (‘ECL’) rate is based on the Group’s historical experience and the Group’s expectation of economic conditions over
the period until receivables are expected to be paid.120 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022

At 31 December 2022 the Group’s combined trade receivables balance with three US national wholesale distributors,
McKesson Corp., AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Cardinal Health, Inc., was equivalent to CHF 3.1 billion representing 25% of the
Group’s consolidated trade receivables (2021: CHF 2.8 billion representing 23%). There is no other significant concentration
of counterparty credit risk due to the Group’s large number of customers and their wide geographical spread. Risk limits and
exposures are continuously monitored by country and by the nature of counterparties. The Group obtains credit insurance
and similar enhancements when appropriate to protect the collection of trade receivables. At 31 December 2022 no collateral
was considered to measure expected credit losses for trade receivables (2021: none).
The nature and geographic location of counterparties to accounts receivable that are not overdue or impaired are shown in the
table below. These include the balances with US national wholesalers described above.

Cash and marketable securities (excluding equity securities). At 31 December 2022 the Group had cash and marketable
securities (excluding equity securities) of CHF 9.8 billion (2021: CHF 13.0 billion). These are subject to a policy of restricting
exposures to high-quality counterparties and setting defined limits for individual counterparties. These limits and counterparty
credit ratings are reviewed regularly.
Cash and cash equivalents are held with banks and financial institutions, which are predominantly rated as investment grade
(95% in 2022 and 98% in 2021), based on Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s ratings. Cash and short-term time deposits are subject
to rules which limit the Group’s exposure to individual financial institutions.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 121
Impairment on cash and cash equivalents is measured on a 12-month expected credit losses (‘ECL’) basis with a reference to
external credit ratings of the counterparties. This reflects the short maturities of the exposures in cash and cash equivalents.
The Group considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on these external credit ratings.
Investments in marketable securities (excluding equity securities) are entered into on the basis of guidelines with regard to
liquidity, quality and maximum amount. As a general rule, the Group invests only in high-quality securities with adequate liquidity
and with counterparties that have a credit rating of at least Baa3 from Moody’s and BBB- from Standard & Poor’s.
The credit risk of the counterparties with external ratings below investment grade or with no rating is closely monitored and
reviewed on an individual basis.

Loss allowance a) 1 0 1 1 0 1
a) The loss allowance related to fair value through OCI does not affect the carrying amount of marketable securities (excluding equity securities) but is booked against
corresponding OCI reserve instead.
Debt securities at amortised cost and those at fair value through OCI are investment grade and therefore considered to be low
risk, and thus the impairment allowance is determined at 12-month expected credit losses (‘ECL’) with a reference to external
credit ratings of the counterparties. There were no debt securities for which the Group observed a significant increase in the
credit risk which would require the application of the lifetime expected credit losses impairment model. In addition, there were
no material movements in the loss allowance in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Master netting agreements. The Group enters into derivative transactions and collateral agreements under International
Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements with the respective counterparties in order to mitigate
counterparty risk. Under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions
outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. The ISDA
agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the balance sheet as the Group does not have a currently enforceable
right to offset recognised amounts, because the right to offset is only enforceable on the occurrence of future events, such as
a default or other credit events.
Contract terms. At 31 December 2022 there were no significant financial assets whose terms had been renegotiated
(2021: none).
Impairment losses on financial assets excluding equity investments/securities. During 2022 there were no impairment losses
(2021: none).122 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time. The
Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements
at any point in time. Roche and Chugai enjoy strong credit quality and are rated by at least one major credit rating agency.
The ratings will permit efficient access to the international capital markets in the event of major financing requirements.
At 31 December 2022 the Group had an unused committed credit line with various financial institutions totalling CHF 7.2 billion
(2021: CHF 7.2 billion), of which CHF 6.9 billion (2021: CHF 6.9 billion) serve as a back-stop line for the commercial paper
program. On 3 July 2019 the previously existing committed credit lines were refinanced by one new committed credit line with
an initial maturity of five years and two annual extension options, both of which were exercised extending the maturity to 2026.

Take-or-pay commitments. The Group has entered into contract manufacturing agreements with various companies to
further develop manufacturing capacity and flexibility, mainly in the Pharmaceuticals Division. There are future minimum take-
or-pay commitments within some of these agreements with a total potential commitment from the Group of CHF 1.9 billion at
31 December 2022 (2021: CHF 1.4 billion).
Commitments for capital calls. The Group holds investments in funds reported as debt investment at fair value through profit
or loss in which it has committed to invest further upon future capital calls. As of 31 December 2022 the total uncalled capital
commitments for the Group’s investments in funds amounted to CHF 89 million.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 123
Market risk
Market risk arises from changing market prices, mainly foreign exchange rates and interest rates, of the Group’s financial assets
or financial liabilities which affect the Group’s financial result and equity.
Value-at-Risk. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to measure the impact of market risk on its financial instruments.
VaR indicates the value range within which a given financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result
of movements in market prices. VaR is calculated using a historical simulation approach and for each scenario, all financial
instruments are fully valued and the total change in value and earnings is determined. VaR calculations are based on a 95%
confidence level and a holding period of 20 trading days over the past ten years. This holding period reflects the time required
to change the corresponding risk exposure, should this be deemed appropriate.
Actual future gains and losses associated with our treasury activities may differ materially from the VaR analyses due to the
inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes to interest rates, foreign exchange rates and
equity investment prices, particularly in periods of high market volatilities. Furthermore, VaR does not include the effect of
changes in credit spreads.

VaR – Other price component 54 48
Diversification (67) (100)
VaR – Total market risk 261 182
The interest rate component increased due to the bond issuances in February, March and September 2022. The foreign
exchange component and the other price component remained largely stable.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group uses the Swiss franc as its reporting currency and as a result is exposed to movements in foreign currencies, mainly
the US dollar, Japanese yen and euro. The Group’s foreign exchange risk management strategy is to preserve the economic
value of its current and future assets and to minimise the volatility of the Group’s financial result. The primary focus of the
Group’s foreign exchange risk management activities is on hedging transaction exposures arising through foreign currency
flows or monetary positions held in foreign currencies. The Group uses forward contracts, foreign exchange options and cross-
currency swaps to hedge transaction exposures. Application of these instruments intends to continuously immunise against
unfavourable developments of foreign exchange rates.
Interest rate risk
The Group mainly raises debt on a fixed rate basis for bonds and notes. The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates,
mainly for its US dollar, Swiss franc and euro floating rate financial instruments and short-term debt. The Group’s interest rate
risk management strategy is to optimise the net interest result. The Group may use forward contracts, options and interest rate
swaps to hedge its interest rate exposures. Depending on the interest rate environment of major currencies, the Group will use
these instruments to generate an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposures.124 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
Other price risk
Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities. The Group manages the price risk through
placing limits on individual and total equity investments. These limits are defined both as a percentage of total liquid funds and
as an absolute number for individual equity investments.
Capital management
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total capitalisation, being the sum of debt plus equity, including
non-controlling interests. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide benefits for patients and
returns to investors.
• To provide an adequate return to investors based on the level of risk undertaken.
• To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver future benefits for
patients and returns to investors.
• To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The capitalisation is reported to senior management as part of the Group’s regular internal management reporting and is shown
in the table below.

The fair value of bonds and notes is Level 1 and is calculated based on the observable market prices of the debt instruments or
the present value of the future cash flows on the instrument, discounted at a market rate of interest for instruments with similar
credit status, cash flows and maturity periods.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 127
Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined
as follows:
• Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
• Level 2 – observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
• Level 3 – unobservable inputs.

Level 1 financial assets consist of treasury bills, bonds and quoted shares. Level 2 financial assets consist primarily of
commercial paper, certificates of deposit and derivative financial instruments.
The Group determines Level 2 fair values using the following valuation techniques:
• Marketable securities and derivative financial instruments are based on valuation models that use observable market data for
interest rates, yield curves, foreign exchange rates and implied volatilities for similar instruments at the measurement date.
• Equity and debt investments at fair value through OCI and at fair value through profit or loss are based on a valuation model
that uses the most recently published observable market data.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as at the end of the reporting period during which
the transfer has occurred. There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and vice versa during the year
(2021: none).128 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022

Contingent consideration arrangements
The Group is party to certain contingent consideration arrangements, including those from business combinations. The fair
values of contingent consideration from business combinations are determined considering the expected payments and, where
payments are expected to be made beyond the next 12 months, discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted average
discount rate of 5.3% (2021: 2.7%). The expected payments are determined by considering the possible scenarios of forecast
sales and other performance criteria, the amount to be paid under each scenario, and the probability of each scenario. The
significant unobservable inputs are the forecast sales, other performance criteria and the risk-adjusted discount rate. The
estimated fair value would increase if the forecast sales or other performance criteria rates were higher or the risk-adjusted
discount rate was lower. At 31 December 2022 the total potential payments under contingent consideration arrangements
arising from business combinations could be up to CHF 0.4 billion (2021: CHF 0.4 billion) as follows:

Hedge accounting
As described above the Group’s risk management strategy is to hedge the transaction exposures arising through foreign
currency flows or monetary positions held in foreign currencies as well as to generate an appropriate mix of fixed and floating
rate exposures. The level of hedging depends on market conditions and business requirements of the Group. The Group
designates a specific interest rate risk management objective to ensure that a predetermined level of its interest rate risk
exposure is at a floating rate.
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness
assessments at each reporting date to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and the hedging
instrument. The Group performs a qualitative assessment of the hedge effectiveness using a critical terms match method.
As the critical terms of the hedged items and the hedging instruments match, the Group concludes that risks being hedged
for the hedged items and the hedging instruments are sufficiently aligned, that there is no inherent mismatch in the hedging
relationship and that a 100% hedge ratio applies both for the actual quantities hedged and for the hedge accounting.

The ineffective portion of the hedge accounting is recognised in the income statement and included in other financial income
(expense). It is measured using the hypothetical derivative method for cash flow hedges and the cumulative dollar offset method
for fair value hedges. At 31 December 2022 and 2021 none of the above potential sources of ineffectiveness, individually
or collectively, resulted in material amounts of actual ineffectiveness being reported for any hedge accounting relationships.
The table below shows fair values and nominal amounts of derivative financial instruments, including a range of the maturity of
the nominal amount of the hedging instruments, which are designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge and a fair
value hedge. At 31 December 2022 and 2021, respectively, the Group had the following cash flow hedges and fair value hedges
which are designated in a qualifying hedge relationship:

The fair values of derivative financial instruments used for hedge accounting are included in other current assets (see Note 16)
or other current liabilities (see Note 19). The Group’s approach to managing market risk, including interest rate risk and foreign
currency risk, is discussed in the ‘Market risk’ section in this Note.
Cash flow hedges. The Group had entered into cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk on
some of the bonds and notes issued by the Group which were denominated in euro. On the due date of 4 March 2021 the Group
redeemed the remaining notes with an outstanding amount of EUR 1.14 billion (see Note 21) and the related remaining cross-
currency swaps expired at the same time. In 2021 there was no ineffective portion.
In November and December 2021 the Group entered into treasury locks to hedge interest rate risk of fixed rate notes issued by
the Group on 13 December 2021. At this date the treasury locks were settled. At 31 December 2022 a relating hedging reserve
of CHF 41 million (excluding income taxes, CHF 35 million net of tax) was held as a deduction within equity (31 December 2021:
CHF 43 million excluding income taxes, CHF 37 million net of tax), which will be released and transferred to the income statement
within financing costs (see Note 4) until redemption of the fixed rate notes. There was no ineffective portion.
Chugai has entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge a part of its foreign translation exposure to Swiss franc and
US dollar. At 31 December 2022 such instruments were recorded as fair value assets of CHF 39 million and as fair value
liabilities of CHF 173 million (2021: fair value assets of CHF 67 million and fair value liabilities of CHF 120 million). There was
no ineffective portion.132 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022

On the due date of 4 March 2021 the Group redeemed the remaining notes with an outstanding amount of EUR 1.14 billion
(see Note 21) and the related remaining cross-currency swaps expired at the same time. As a result, there was no remaining
hedging reserve for cross-currency swaps at 31 December 2021. In 2022 and 2021 there were no hedging relationships for
which hedge accounting is no longer applied. The changes in the hedging reserve within equity are shown in Note 22.

Fair value hedges. The Group has entered into some interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in the fair value
of some of its fixed-term debt instruments in respect of a benchmark interest rate. At 31 December 2022 such instruments
were recorded as fair value assets of CHF 0 million and as fair value liabilities of CHF 155 million (2021: fair value assets of
CHF 2 million and fair value liabilities of CHF 20 million). During 2022 fair value adjustments of CHF 137 million were recorded as
expense on these interest rate swaps (2021: CHF 27 million as expense). As the fair value hedge had been highly effective since
inception, the result of the interest rate swaps was largely offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt instruments.
The Group’s approach to managing market risk, including interest rate risk, is discussed in the ‘Market risk’ section in this Note.

34. Significant accounting policies
Consolidation policy
Subsidiaries are all companies over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed
to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its
power over the entity. Companies acquired during the year are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to
the Group, and subsidiaries to be divested are included up to the date on which control passes from the Group. Intercompany
balances, transactions and resulting unrealised income are eliminated in full. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are
accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has already been obtained and if they do not result in a loss of
control. Associates are companies over which the Group exercises, or has the power to exercise, significant influence, but which
it does not control, and they are accounted for using the equity method.
Segment reporting
For the purpose of segment reporting the Group’s Corporate Executive Committee (CEC) is considered to be the Group’s Chief
Operating Decision Maker. The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the organisation units for which
information is reported to the CEC on a regular basis. The information provided is used as the basis of the segment revenue and
profit disclosures reported in Note 2, with the geographic analysis based on the location of customers. Selected segment
balance sheet information is also routinely provided to the CEC.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis. Operating assets and liabilities consist of
property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade receivables/payables, inventories and other assets and
liabilities, such as provisions, which can be reasonably attributed to the reported operating segments. Non-operating assets
and liabilities mainly include current and deferred income tax balances, post-employment benefit assets/liabilities and financial
assets/liabilities such as cash, marketable securities, investments and debt.
Foreign currency translation
The Annual Financial Statements are presented in Swiss francs. Most Group companies use their local currency as their
functional currency. Certain Group companies use other currencies (such as US dollar, Swiss franc or euro) as their functional
currency where this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Local transactions
in other currencies are initially reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses from the
settlement of such transactions and gains and losses on translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other
currencies are included in income, except when they are qualifying cash flow hedges or arise on monetary items that, in
substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign entity. In such cases the gains and losses are deferred into other
comprehensive income.
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using functional currencies other than Swiss francs are translated
into Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange. The income statement and statement of cash flows are translated at the
average rates of exchange for the year. Translation differences due to the changes in exchange rates between the beginning
and the end of the year and the difference between net income translated at the average and year-end exchange rates are
taken directly to other comprehensive income.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 143
Revenue
Sales. Revenue from the sale of goods supplied (product sales) and services rendered are recorded as ‘Sales’.
Sales are recognised when a promise in a customer contract (performance obligation) has been satisfied by transferring control
over the promised goods and services to the customer. Control over a promised good or service refers to the ability to direct
the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, those goods or services. Control is usually transferred
upon shipment, delivery to, upon receipt of goods by the customer, or as services are rendered, in accordance with the delivery
and acceptance terms agreed with the customers. For goods subject to installation, such as instruments sold in the Diagnostics
Division, sales are generally recognised upon completion of the installation at the customer’s site and customer acceptance.
The amount of sales to be recognised (transaction price) is based on the consideration the Group expects to receive in exchange
for its goods and services, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties such as value added taxes or other taxes
directly linked to sales. If a contract contains more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each
performance obligation based on their relative stand-alone selling prices.
Instruments in the Diagnostics Division may be sold together with other goods such as reagents and other consumables as well
as services under a single contract or under several contracts that are combined for revenue recognition purposes. Sales are
recognised upon satisfaction of each of the performance obligations in the contract. Instruments are either sold in cash and
instalment sales transactions or otherwise made available to customers under finance lease and operating lease transactions.
• Finance leases: Arrangements in which the Group transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the
customer are treated as finance lease arrangements. Income from finance leases is recognised as revenue at amounts that
represent the fair value of the instrument, which approximates the present value of the minimum lease payments under the
arrangement. As interest rates embedded in finance lease arrangements are approximately market rates, income from finance
leases is comparable to revenue for outright sales. Finance income for finance lease arrangements longer than twelve months
is deferred and subsequently recognised based on a pattern that approximates the use of the effective interest rate method
and recorded in royalty and other operating income.
• Operating leases: Income from operating leases is recognised as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term or, when
lease revenue is entirely variable and subject to subsequent reagent sales, as the performance obligation to deliver reagents
is satisfied.
Sales, net of discounts, are based on estimates regarding the related obligations, including their stand-alone selling prices or
fair values. It requires judgement to determine when different obligations are satisfied, including whether enforceable purchase
commitments for further obligations exist and when they arise.
For contracts with distributors, no sales are recognised when goods are physically transferred to the distributor under a
consignment arrangement, or if the distributor acts as an agent. In such cases, sales are recognised when control over
the goods transfers to the end-customer, and distributor’s commissions are presented within marketing and distribution.
Commissions and similar payments to distributors acting as principals are deducted from sales unless such payments are in
exchange for a distinct service.
The consideration received by the Group in exchange for its goods and services may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration
is only recognised when it is considered highly probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur once the underlying
uncertainty related to variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The most common elements of variable consideration in
the Pharmaceuticals Division are listed below:
• Government and regulatory mandatory price reductions. The major elements of these mandatory price reductions are the
340B Drug Discount Program, Medicaid and other plans in the US.
• Contractual price reductions. These include rebates and chargebacks that are the result of contractual agreements that are
primarily volume based and performance based.
• Cash discounts. These include credits offered to wholesalers for remitting payment on their purchases within contractually
defined incentive periods.
• Customer returns reserves. These are allowances established for expected product returns.144 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
Revenues from product sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts and estimates
of product returns, all of which are established at the time of sale. All product sales allowances are based on estimates of the
amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration historical experience, current
contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends such as competitive pricing and new product
introductions, estimated inventory levels, and the shelf life of products. If actual future results vary, these estimates need
to be adjusted, with an effect on sales and earnings in the period of the adjustment. Sales reductions that are expected to
be withheld by the customer upon settlement, such as contractual price reductions and cash discounts, are recorded in the
balance sheet as a deduction from trade receivables. Sales reductions that are separately payable to customers, governmental
health authorities or healthcare regulatory authorities are recorded in the balance sheet as accrued liabilities. Provisions for
sales returns are recorded in the balance sheet as other provisions.
The Group recognises a deferred income (contract liability) if consideration has been received (or has become receivable)
before the Group transfers the promised goods or services to the customer. Deferred income mainly relates to remaining
performance obligations for goods free of charge under certain patient access or similar programmes, reagents and other
consumables and services.
Remaining performance obligations in (partially) unsatisfied long-term contracts are either included in deferred income or
are related to amounts the Group expects to receive for goods and services that have not yet been transferred to customers
under existing, non-cancellable or otherwise enforceable contracts. These are mainly associated with contracts with minimum
purchase commitments related to reagents and consumables for previously sold instruments as well as monitoring and
maintenance services. For contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, the Group has elected the practical
expedient to not disclose the transaction price for remaining performance obligations at the end of each reporting period and
at which point in time the Group expects to recognise these sales.
Royalty and other operating income. Royalty and other operating income includes royalty income, income from out-licensing
agreements and income from disposal of products and other items.
Royalty income earned through a licence is recognised as the underlying sales are recorded by the licensee.
Income from out-licensing agreements typically arises from the receipt of upfront, milestone and other similar payments
from third parties for granting a licence to product- or technology-related intellectual property (IP). Out-licensing agreements
may be entered into with no further obligation or may include commitments to conduct research, late-stage development,
regulatory approval, co-marketing or manufacturing. Licences granted are usually rights to use IP and are generally unique.
Therefore the basis of allocating revenue to performance obligations makes use of the residual approach. Upfront payments
and other licensing fees are usually recognised upon granting the licence unless some of the income shall be deferred for other
performance obligations using the residual approach. Such deferred income is released and recognised as revenue when other
performance obligations are satisfied. Milestone payments are typically received upon reaching a specific scientific milestone
(development milestone) or upon achieving a certain annual sales milestone (commercial milestone). Development milestone
income is recognised at the point in time when it is highly probable that the respective milestone event criteria is achieved, and
the risk of revenue reversal is considered remote. Commercial milestone income is accrued and recognised as revenue when it is
highly probable that the annual sales milestone is reached during the period.
Payments received for the disposal of product and similar rights are recognised as revenue upon transfer of control over
such rights. To the extent that some of these payments relate to other performance obligations, a portion is deferred using
the residual approach and recognised as revenue when or as activities such as manufacturing or other services are rendered.
Income from profit-sharing agreements with collaboration partners is recognised as underlying sales and cost of sales are
recorded by the collaboration partners. Also included is income from other services rendered which are usually not part of
the Group’s primary business activities, to the extent that such revenue is not recorded under ‘Sales’, and is recognised when
control transfers and performance obligations are satisfied.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and related production overheads of goods sold and services
rendered. Royalties, alliance and collaboration expenses, including all collaboration profit-sharing agreements, are also
reported as part of cost of sales. Start-up costs between validation and the achievement of normal production capacity are
expensed as incurred.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 145
Research and development
Internal research and development activities are expensed as incurred for the following:
• Internal research costs incurred for the purpose of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.
• Internal development costs incurred for the application of research findings or other knowledge to plan and develop new
products for commercial production. The development projects undertaken by the Group are subject to technical, regulatory
and other uncertainties, such that, in the opinion of management, the criteria for capitalisation as intangible assets are not
met prior to obtaining marketing approval by the regulatory authorities in major markets.
• Post-marketing studies after regulatory approval, such as phase IV costs in the pharmaceuticals business, generally involve
safety surveillance and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives marketing approval to be sold. They may be
required by regulatory authorities or may be undertaken for safety or commercial reasons. The costs of such post-marketing
studies are not capitalised as intangible assets as, in the opinion of management, they do not generate separately identifiable
incremental future economic benefits that can be reliably measured.
Acquired in-process research and development resources obtained through in-licensing arrangements, business combinations
or separate asset purchases, including asset acquisitions, are capitalised as intangible assets. The acquired asset must be
controlled by the Group, be separately identifiable and expected to generate future economic benefits, even if uncertainty
exists as to whether the research and development will ultimately result in a marketable product. Consequently, upfront
and milestone payments to third parties for pharmaceutical products or compounds before regulatory marketing approval
are recognised as intangible assets. Assets acquired through such arrangements are measured on the basis set out in the
‘Intangible assets’ policy. Subsequent internal research and development costs incurred post-acquisition are treated in the
same way as other internal research and development costs. If research and development are embedded in contracts for
strategic alliances, the Group carefully assesses whether upfront or milestone payments constitute funding of research and
development work or acquisition of an asset.
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits include wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, profit
sharing and bonuses, and non-monetary benefits for current employees. The costs are recognised within the operating results
when the employee has rendered the associated service. The Group recognises a liability for profit sharing and bonuses where
contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Long-term employee benefits include long-service or sabbatical leave, long-service benefits and long-term disability benefits.
The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment. Any changes in the carrying value of other
long-term employee benefit liabilities are recognised within the operating results.
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever
an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. Termination costs are recognised at the earlier of
when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of the benefits or when the Group recognises any related restructuring costs.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
For defined contribution plans the Group contributions are recognised within the operating results when the employee has
rendered the associated service. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a
reduction in future payments is available.
For defined benefit plans the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less
the fair value of the plan assets. All changes in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as they occur as follows:
Recognised in the income statement:
• Current service cost is charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results.
• Past service cost, including curtailment gains or losses, is recognised immediately in general and administration within the
operating results.
• Settlement gains or losses are recognised in general and administration within the operating results.
• Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is recognised in financing costs.146 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
Recognised in other comprehensive income:
• Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments (the difference between previous assumptions and what has
actually occurred) and changes in actuarial assumptions.
• The return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability.
• Any change in the limit on the recognition of plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit
liability.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is comprised of interest income on plan assets, interest cost on the defined
benefit obligation and interest on the effect of the limit on the recognition of pension assets. The net interest is calculated
using the same discount rate that is used in calculating the defined benefit obligation, applied to the net defined liability at the
start of the period, taking into account any changes from contribution or benefit payments.
Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to
use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan.
Equity compensation plans
The fair value of all equity compensation awards granted to employees is estimated at the grant date and recorded as an
expense over the vesting period. The expense is charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating
results. For equity-settled plans, an increase in equity is recorded for this expense and any subsequent cash flows from
exercises of vested awards are recorded as changes in equity.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction, and include all costs directly
attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner
intended by management. These include items such as costs of site preparation, installation and assembly costs, and
professional fees. The net costs of testing whether the asset is functioning properly, including validation costs, are also
included in the initially recorded cost of construction. Interest and other borrowing costs incurred with respect to qualifying
assets are capitalised and included in the carrying value of the assets. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a
straight-line basis, except for land, which is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives of major classes of depreciable assets
are as follows:
Land improvements 40 years
Buildings 10–50 years
Machinery and equipment 4–15 years
Diagnostic instruments 3–5 years
Office equipment 3–6 years
Motor vehicles 5–8 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate
components. The estimated useful lives of the assets are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation charges
are accelerated. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 147
Leases
Where the Group is the lessee. At inception of a contract the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease.
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time
in exchange for consideration. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for each contract
that is, or contains, a lease at the lease commencement date, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
Payments for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the
term of the respective lease. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments that are
not paid at the lease commencement date. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or,
if not readily determinable, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate in the respective markets. Lease payments include fixed
payments, variable payments that depend on an index or rate known at the lease commencement date and payments from
exercising extension or purchase options if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise. The lease liability is subsequently
measured at amortised costs using the effective interest method. It is remeasured, with a corresponding adjustment to the
related right-of-use asset, when there is a change in future lease payments following a contract renegotiation, a change of
an index or rate or a reassessment of options. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial
amount of the lease liability adjusted for any payments made at or before the lease commencement date and which includes
any initial direct costs incurred and expected costs of obligations to dismantle, remove or refurbish the underlying asset,
less any incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date
over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset. Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment
whenever there is an indication for impairment.
Where the Group is the lessor. Certain assets, mainly diagnostics instruments, are leased to third-party customers through
both finance and operating lease arrangements. Such transactions may be entered into in separate contracts or in combined
contracts including reagents and other consumables and services. The treatment of leasing transactions is mainly determined
by whether the lease is considered to be an operating or finance lease, which requires judgement. In making this assessment,
management looks at the substance of the lease, as well as the legal form, and makes a judgement about whether substantially
all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease. If not, then it is
an operating lease. Arrangements which do not take the legal form of a lease but that nevertheless convey the right to use an
asset are also covered by such judgemental assessments.
• Finance leases: Finance lease assets are reported as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease.
Income from finance leases is recognised as revenue at amounts that represent the stand-alone selling price of the
instrument, which approximates the present value of the minimum lease payments under the arrangement. Minimum lease
payments exclude any variable lease payments or contingent rent. Finance income for finance lease arrangements longer
than twelve months is deferred and subsequently recognised based on a pattern that approximates the use of the effective
interest method and recorded in royalty and other operating income.
• Operating leases: Income from operating leases is recognised as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term at
amounts that represent the stand-alone selling price of the instrument, which approximates the present value of the minimum
lease payments under the arrangement. Minimum lease payments exclude any variable lease payments or contingent rent.
When lease revenue is entirely based on variable lease payments and subject to subsequent reagent sales, it is recognised as
the performance obligations for reagents are satisfied.
Sales, net of discounts, are based on estimates regarding the related obligations, including their stand-alone selling prices.
It requires judgement to determine when different obligations are satisfied, including whether enforceable purchase
commitments for further obligations exist and when they arise.
Mergers and acquisitions
Business combinations. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. At the date
of the acquisition the Group initially recognises the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and
any non-controlling interest in the acquired business. The consideration transferred is measured at fair value at the date
of acquisition. Where the Group does not acquire 100% ownership of the acquired business, non-controlling interests are
recorded either at fair value or as the proportion of the fair value of the acquired net assets attributable to the non-controlling
interest. Directly attributable acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred within general and administration expenses.148 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
Asset acquisitions. Asset acquisitions are acquisitions of legal entities that do not qualify as business combinations. At the
date of the acquisition the Group initially recognises the individual identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The cost
to the Group at the date of the acquisition is allocated to the individual identifiable assets and liabilities on the basis of their
relative fair values at the date of the acquisition. Subsequent consideration for performance-related development milestones is
recognised as intangible assets when the specific milestones have been achieved and other recognition criteria are met. Such
transactions do not give rise to goodwill. Material directly attributable acquisition-related costs are included in the cost of the
acquired assets.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises in a business combination and is the excess of the consideration transferred to acquire the business over
the underlying fair value of the net identified assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least
annually and upon the occurrence of an indication of impairment.
Intangible assets
Purchased patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Assets that have been
acquired through a business combination are initially recorded at fair value. Commercial software development costs are
capitalised when certain recognition criteria such as technical feasibility and commercial viability are met. Once available for
use, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment
at each reporting date. The estimated useful life is the lower of the legal duration and the economic useful life. The estimated
useful lives of intangible assets are regularly reviewed. Estimated useful lives of major classes of amortisable intangible assets
are as follows:
Product intangibles in use up to 20 years
Marketing intangibles in use up to 15 years
Technology intangibles in use up to 20 years
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets
An impairment assessment is carried out when there is evidence that an asset may be impaired. In addition, intangible assets
that are not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. When the recoverable amount of an asset, being the higher
of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value is reduced to
its recoverable amount. This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. Value in use is calculated
using estimated cash flows, generally over a five-year period, with extrapolating projections for subsequent years. These are
discounted using an appropriate long-term interest rate. When an impairment loss arises, the useful life of the asset is reviewed
and, if necessary, the future depreciation/amortisation charge is accelerated. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently
decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement as an impairment reversal.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is assessed for impairment at each reporting date and is additionally tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is
allocated to cash-generating units and when the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, being the higher of its fair
value less costs of disposal or its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value of the goodwill is reduced
to its recoverable amount. This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. When an acquired
business that is included within a cash-generating unit permanently ceases to operate, then it is treated as a disposal of that
business. For separately identifiable goodwill that was generated on the initial acquisition of that business and where all of the
factors that made up that goodwill are entirely unrelated to the continuing operations of the cash-generating unit, then the
goodwill is deemed to have been disposed of and is fully impaired. As described in Note 9, this also applies if acquired products
permanently cease to generate economic benefits or if acquired technologies permanently cease to operate. The impairment
testing methodology is further described in Note 9.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 149
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods, work in process and intermediates
includes raw materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs and overheads based upon the normal capacity of
production facilities. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price
less cost to completion and selling expenses.
Receivables, including accounts receivable
Receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts, trade discounts,
cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances. A receivable represents a right to consideration that is unconditional
and excludes contract assets. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for expected credit losses over the term
of the receivables. These estimates are based on specific indicators, such as the ageing of customer balances, specific
credit circumstances and the Group’s historical loss rates for each category of customers, and adjusted for forward-looking
macroeconomic data. Expenses for doubtful trade receivables are recognised within marketing and distribution expenses.
Trade discounts, cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the
recognition of the related sales, using estimates based on existing contractual obligations, historical trends and the Group’s
experience.
Receivables are written off (either partly or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Where receivables
have been written off, the Group continues to engage in enforcement activities to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where
recoveries are made, these are recognised in profit or loss.
For trade and lease receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach prescribed by IFRS 9, which requires/permits the use
of the lifetime expected loss provision from initial recognition of the receivables. The Group measures an allowance for doubtful
accounts equal to the credit losses expected over the lifetime of the trade and lease receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and time, call and current balances with banks and similar institutions.
Such balances are only reported as cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to
insignificant risk of changes in their fair value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to an outflow of
resources that can be reliably estimated. In particular, restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has a detailed
formal plan that has either commenced implementation or has been announced. Provisions are recorded for the estimated
ultimate liability that is expected to arise and are discounted when the time value of money is material. A contingent liability is
disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation
cannot be measured with reasonable reliability. Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of
economic benefits is probable.
Fair values
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices or by the use of established
valuation techniques such as option pricing models and the discounted cash flow method if quoted prices in an active market
are not available.150 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
Financial instruments
The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following measurement categories which are disclosed in Note 31: amortised
cost; fair value through OCI; fair value through OCI – equity investments; or fair value through profit or loss (including hedging
instruments).
The classification depends on the Group’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the
cash flows. The Group reclassifies debt securities and financial assets at amortised cost when and only when its business model
for managing those assets changes.
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs
of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.
Amortised cost. Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments
of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment. A gain or loss on a debt security that is
subsequently measured at amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset
is derecognised or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other financial income using the effective
interest rate method. Assets at amortised cost are mainly comprised of accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and
time accounts over three months.
Fair value through other comprehensive income (fair value through OCI). These are financial assets that are held for
collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments
of principal and interest. Those are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value are
recorded in other comprehensive income, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign
exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain
or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss. Interest income from these financial assets is
included in other financial income using the effective interest rate method. Fair value through other comprehensive income
assets are mainly comprised of money market instruments and debt securities.
Equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (fair value through OCI). These are equity
investments in private biotechnology companies, which are kept as part of the Group’s strategic alliance efforts. These assets
are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as other financial income in profit or loss unless the dividend
clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and
included in the fair value reserve. When such an asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI
is reclassified within equity from the fair value reserve to retained earnings and never to profit or loss.
Fair value through profit or loss. These are financial assets whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis. A gain
or loss on a financial asset that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging
relationship is recognised in profit or loss and presented within other financial income (expense) in the period in which it arises.
Fair value through profit or loss assets are mainly comprised of equity investments/securities and debt investments. Contingent
consideration liabilities are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in
general and administration within the operating results of the income statement.
Fair value through profit or loss – hedging instruments. These are derivative financial instruments that are used to manage
the exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. These instruments are initially recorded and
subsequently carried at fair value. Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, all
changes in fair value are recorded as other financial income (expense).
Other financial liabilities. These are non-derivative financial liabilities. Other financial liabilities are initially recorded at
fair value, less transaction costs, and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Other
financial liabilities are mainly comprised of debt and trade payables.
Debt. Debt instruments are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Subsequently
they are reported at amortised cost. Any discount between the net proceeds received and the principal value due on
redemption is amortised over the duration of the debt instrument and is recognised as part of financing costs using the
effective interest rate method.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 151
Derecognition. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual cash flows from the asset expire or when the Group
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows from the financial assets in a transaction in which substantially all the
risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when the contractual
obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) for financial assets measured at amortised cost and
debt securities measured at fair value through OCI.
For trade and lease receivables the Group measures the allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.
For debt securities carried at fair value through OCI and debt securities and other financial assets at amortised cost, which are
determined to have low credit risk based on external credit ratings of the counterparties, the Group measures loss allowances
at an amount equal to 12-month ECL. The Group considers debt securities to have low credit risk when their credit risk rating
is equivalent to the globally understood definition of ‘investment grade’. The Group considers this to be at least Baa3 from
Moody’s and BBB- from Standard & Poor’s. When the credit risk of debt securities carried at fair value through OCI and debt
securities and other financial assets at amortised cost has increased significantly since their initial recognition, the Group
measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. The Group assumes that the credit risk of such instruments have
increased significantly if they are more than 30 days past due.
Financial assets are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the
case when the Group determines that the customer does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient
cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off are still subject to
enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s policy for recovery of amounts due.
Hedge accounting
The Group uses derivatives to manage its exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. The
instruments used may include interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, forwards contracts and options. The Group generally
limits the use of hedge accounting to certain significant transactions. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship
must meet several strict conditions on eligibility of hedging and hedged instruments, formal designation and documentation,
as well as hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. While many of these transactions can be considered as hedges in
economic terms, if the required conditions are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case
the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship, which means
that any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in other financial income (expense).
Cash flow hedge. This is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction and could affect profit or loss. The hedging
instrument is recorded at fair value. The effective portion of the hedge is included in other comprehensive income and any
ineffective portion is reported in other financial income (expense). If the hedging relationship is the hedge of the foreign
currency risk of a firm commitment or highly probable forecasted transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial
item, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive
income are included in the initial carrying value of the non-financial item at the date of recognition. For all other cash flow
hedges, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive
income are included in other financial income (expense) when the forecasted transaction affects net income.
Fair value hedge. This is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or an unrecognised
firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk
and could affect profit or loss. The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item is recorded at its previous
carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair value that are attributable to the hedged risk. Changes in the fair values are
reported in other financial income (expense).152 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2022
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding taxes payable on the
distribution of retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based on income, such as property and capital taxes,
are included within general and administration expenses.
Liabilities for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally
relating to subsidiaries, are only recognised where it is probable that such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future.
Where the amount of tax liabilities is uncertain, accruals are recorded within income tax liabilities for management’s best
estimate of the ultimate liability that is expected to arise based on the specific circumstances and the Group’s historical
experience.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their carrying values. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the same taxation authority and
when there is a legally enforceable right to offset them. Deferred taxes are determined based on the currently enacted tax
rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction where the Group operates.
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The original purchase cost,
consideration received for subsequent resale of these equity instruments and other movements are reported as changes in
equity. These instruments are held for the Group’s potential conversion obligations that may arise from the Group’s equity
compensation plans.
Changes in accounting policies
In 2022 the Group has implemented various minor amendments to existing standards and interpretations, which have no
material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position.
Future new and revised standards
The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of the various new and revised standards and interpretations that
will be mandatory from 1 January 2023 which the Group has not yet applied. Based on an analysis to date, the Group does
not anticipate that these will have a material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position. The Group is also
assessing other new and revised standards which are not mandatory until after 2023.Finance Report 2022 Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting | Roche Group 153
Report of Roche Management on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting
Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
control over financial reporting. The internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance over the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2022
based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment,
management has concluded that the system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 31 December 2022.
The Statutory Auditor KPMG AG has audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended

Statutory Auditor’s Report
To the General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise
the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2022 and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement
of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements (pages 43–152) give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial
position of the Group as at 31 December 2022, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for
the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and Swiss Standards
on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the ‘Auditor’s
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements’ section of our report. We are independent of the Group
in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law, together with the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as the
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including
International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

The Group’s pharmaceuticals business makes sales Our audit procedures included, amongst others, on a sample
to various customers in the US that fall under certain basis, obtaining management’s calculations for accrued
government-mandated and commercial contracts, purchasing liabilities, provisions and accounts receivable deductions,
and reimbursement arrangements, of which the most testing the accuracy of the calculations and assessing the
significant is the 340B Drug Discount Program. The Group appropriateness of key inputs and assumptions used in the

We focused on this area because the arrangements are
complex and because establishing an appropriate year-end
position requires significant judgement and estimation by
management. The assumptions required for these estimates
are also made more complicated given the recent loss of

Other Information
The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in
the finance report and the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial
statements of the company, the remuneration report and our auditor’s reports thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and,
in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view
in accordance with IFRS and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law,
ISAs and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions
of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgement and maintain
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal control.
— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made.
— Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going
concern.
— Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures,
and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation.Finance Report 2022 Statutory Auditor’s Report | Roche Group 159
— Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within
the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision
and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.
We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report
because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such
communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and PS-CH 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has
been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.
We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

Alternative Performance Measures
The financial information included in the Financial Review includes certain Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) which are
not accounting measures as defined by IFRS, in particular the core results, net working capital, net operating assets, free cash
flow and constant exchange rates. These APMs should not be used instead of, or considered as alternatives to, the Group’s
consolidated financial results based on IFRS. These APMs may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other
companies. All APMs presented in the Financial Review relate to the performance of the current year and comparative periods.
Core results
Core results allow for an assessment of both the Group’s actual results as defined by IFRS and the underlying performance of
the business. The core results concept, which is used in the internal management of the business, is based on the IFRS results,
with the following adjustments:
• Global restructuring plans (see Note 7) are excluded.
• Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (see Note 10), with the exception of commercial software intangible assets,
and impairment of goodwill (see Note 9) are excluded.
• Acquisition accounting and other impacts from the accounting for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and alliance transactions
(see Financial Review) are excluded.
• Discontinued operations (currently none) are excluded.
• Legal and environmental cases (see Financial Review) are excluded.
• Global issues outside the healthcare sector beyond the Group’s control are excluded.
• Material treasury items such as major debt restructurings (currently none) are excluded.
• Pension plan settlements (see Note 26) are excluded.
• The tax benefit recorded under IFRS in respect of Equity Compensation Plans (ECPs), which varies according to the price of
the underlying equity, is replaced by a normalised tax benefit, being the IFRS 2 expense multiplied by the applicable tax rate
(see Note 5).
The Group’s IFRS results, including the divisional breakdown, are reconciled to the core results in the tables below. The
calculation of Core EPS is also given in the tables below. Additional commentary to the adjustment items is given in the Financial
Review.Finance Report 2022 Multi-Year Overview and Supplementary Information | Roche Group 165

Free cash flow
Free cash flow is used to assess the Group’s ability to generate the cash required to conduct and maintain its operations.
It also indicates the Group’s ability to generate cash to finance dividend payments, repay debt and to undertake merger and
acquisition activities. The free cash flow concept is used in the internal management of the business.
Operating free cash flow is calculated based on the IFRS operating profit and adjusted for certain non-cash items, movements
in net working capital and capital expenditures (investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as well
as the principal portion of lease liabilities paid for leased assets). Operating free cash flow is different from cash flows from
operating activities as defined by IAS 7 in that it includes capital expenditures (which are within the responsibility of divisional
management) and excludes income taxes paid (which are not within the responsibility of divisional management). Cash outflows
from defined benefit plans are allocated to the operating free cash flow based on the current service cost with the residual
allocated to treasury activities.
Free cash flow is calculated as the operating free cash flow adjusted for treasury activities and taxes paid. Free cash flow is
different from total cash flows as defined by IAS 7 in that it excludes dividend payments, cash inflows/outflows from financing
activities such as issuance/repayment of debt, purchase/sale of marketable securities and cash inflows/outflows from mergers,
acquisitions and divestments.
Operating free cash flow and free cash flow are calculated as shown in the tables below. Additional commentary to the
adjustment items is given in the Financial Review.168 Roche Group | Multi-Year Overview and Supplementary Information Finance Report 2022

EBITDA
The Group does not use Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) in either its internal management
reporting or its external communications. In the opinion of the Group’s management, operating free cash flow gives a more
useful and consistent measurement of ‘cash earnings’ than EBITDA, which includes many non-cash items such as provisions,
allowances for trade receivables and inventories, and certain non-cash entries arising from acquisition accounting and pension
accounting. Operating free cash flow also includes the cash used for investments in property, plant and equipment, leased
assets and intangible assets, whereas EBITDA excludes all costs and cash outflows for these items.
For the convenience of those readers who do use EBITDA, this is provided in the table below. As the starting point this uses the
core results, which already exclude the amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.

Net operating assets
Net operating assets allow for an assessment of the Group’s operating performance of the business independently from
financing and tax activities. Net operating assets are calculated as property, plant and equipment, leased assets (‘right-of-use
assets’), goodwill, intangible assets, net working capital and long-term net operating assets minus provisions.
The calculation of the net operating assets disclosed in Note 2 of the Annual Financial Statements is shown in the tables below.

Net debt
Net debt is used to monitor the Group’s overall short- and long-term liquidity. Net debt is calculated as the sum of total long-term
and short-term debt less marketable securities, cash and cash equivalents.
Net debt calculations, including details of movements during the current year, are shown in the table on page 35 in the Financial
Review.
Net working capital
Net working capital is used to assess the Group’s efficiency in utilising assets and short-term liquidity. Net trade working capital
is calculated as trade receivables and inventories minus trade payables. Net working capital is calculated as net trade working
capital adjusted for other receivables and other payables.
Net working capital and net trade working capital calculations are shown in the tables on page 22 (Pharmaceuticals Division),
page 28 (Diagnostics Division) and page 30 (Corporate) in the Financial Review.
Constant exchange rates
Certain percentage changes in the Financial Review have been calculated using constant exchange rates (CER) which allow for
an assessment of the Group’s financial performance with the effects of exchange rate fluctuations eliminated. The percentage
changes at constant exchange rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the current reported period and
the prior period numbers at constant currency exchange rates, equalling the average exchange rates for the prior year. For
example, a CER change between a 2022 line item and its 2021 equivalent is calculated using the average exchange rate for the
year ended 31 December 2021 for both the 2022 line item and the 2021 line item and subsequently calculating the change in
percent with respect to the two recalculated numbers.
Foreign exchange gains and losses and the gains (losses) on the net monetary positions in hyperinflationary economies are
excluded from the calculation of CER growth rates in the earnings per share disclosures. In countries where there is a significant
devaluation in the local currency in the current year, the simulations use the average exchange rate of the current year instead
of the prior year to avoid that CER growth rates are artificially inflated.172 Roche Group | Roche Securities Finance Report 2022

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel, (the ‘Company’) have been prepared in accordance with the provisions
of Swiss Law on Accounting and Financial Reporting (32nd title of the Swiss Code of Obligations, ‘CO’). Where not prescribed by
law, the significant accounting principles applied are described below.
The Company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with a recognised accounting standard
(International Financial Reporting Standards). In accordance with the CO, the Company decided to forgo presenting additional
information on audit fees in the notes as well as a cash flow statement.
Valuation methods and translation of foreign currencies
Marketable securities are reported at the lower of cost or market value. All other financial assets, including investments, are
reported at cost less appropriate write-downs. Own equity instruments are recognised at cost and deducted from equity at the
time of purchase. If the own equity instruments are sold, the gain or loss is recognised through the income statement. Assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange, except
investments which are translated at historical rates. Transactions during the year which are denominated in foreign currencies
are translated at the exchange rates effective at the relevant transaction dates. Resulting exchange gains and losses are
recognised in the income statement with the exception of unrealised gains which are deferred.
Investments
The direct and indirect investments of the Company into subsidiaries are listed in Note 33 to the Roche Group Annual Financial
Statements. This listing excludes Chugai’s subsidiaries as well as companies that are not material, notably companies that are
inactive, dormant or in liquidation. Ownership interests equal voting rights.
Own equity instruments, including treasury shares
Own equity instruments, including treasury shares, are recognised at the purchase price and deducted from shareholders’
equity at the time of the purchase. In case of a resale, the gain or loss is recognised through other financial income or financial
expenses. Upon cancellation of bearer shares repurchased, such shares are derecognised with a corresponding decrease of
share capital for the nominal value of the cancelled shares and of voluntary reserves and retained earnings for any exceeding
amount. No dividend distributions are made for own equity instruments held by the Company, including treasury shares.
Income from investments (dividend income)
Dividend income from distributions from subsidiaries are accrued for in the financial statements of the Company provided that
the annual general meetings of the subsidiaries approve the distribution of the dividend prior to the approval of the Annual
Financial Statements of Roche Holding Ltd by its Board of Directors. In 2021 income from investments included a dividend
income of CHF 2.8 billion declared by one subsidiary for the 2021 business year as approved by its annual general meeting in
January 2022. This was accrued for at 31 December 2021 and was included in ‘Accrued dividends receivable from subsidiaries’.
Taxes
Direct taxes include corporate income and capital taxes.Finance Report 2022 Notes to the Financial Statements | Roche Holding Ltd, Basel 179
Other income
In 2022 other income related to a reversal of an allowance for a loan receivable and previously recorded impairments for
investments. This other income included CHF 289 million from a release of hidden reserves which had already been taxed in
prior years.
Other expenses
In 2022 other expenses mainly consisted of an impairment for an investment due to a dividend payment.
2. Shareholders’ equity
Share repurchase and share capital reduction
On 26 November 2021, an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company’s shareholders approved a share capital reduction by
CHF 53.3 million from CHF 160.0 million to CHF 106.7 million through the cancellation of all such shares to be repurchased from
Novartis. On 6 December 2021, the Company repurchased 53,309,000 bearer shares, with a nominal value of CHF 1.00 each,
held by Novartis for a total consideration of CHF 19.0 billion. At 31 December 2021, the repurchased shares were reported as
treasury shares at the repurchase price, excluding transaction costs. These shares were cancelled in February 2022 when the
necessary legal procedures had been completed. Upon cancellation of these shares, the Company’s share capital decreased
by CHF 53.3 million from CHF 160.0 million to CHF 106.7 million. The reduction in the share capital became effective at the
beginning of February 2022, with the entry of the share capital reduction in the commercial register of the Canton of Basel-
Stadt on 3 February 2022 and the publication of the share capital reduction in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce on
8 February 2022. The CHF 19.0 billion bridge loan facility drawn in December 2021 to finance the share repurchase was fully
repaid by May 2022. At 31 December 2021 the amount of the bridge loan facility outstanding was CHF 13.5 billion.
Share capital
Following the share capital reduction described above, at 31 December 2022 share capital amounted to CHF 106.7 million. The
share capital consists of 106,691,000 bearer shares with a nominal value of CHF 1.00 each (31 December 2021: 160,000,000
bearer shares). Included in equity are 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine). They are not part of the share
capital and confer no voting rights. However, each non-voting equity security confers the same rights as any of the shares to
participate in the available earnings and in any remaining proceeds from liquidation following repayment of the nominal value of
the share capital and, if any, participation certificates.
Own equity instruments, including treasury shares
At 31 December 2021 the Company held 53,309,000 bearer shares as treasury shares which had been repurchased for a total
consideration of CHF 19.0 billion. The repurchase price, excluding transaction costs, was deducted from shareholders’ equity.
During 2022 the Company neither purchased nor sold bearer shares (2021: no sales of bearer shares). As described above, all
the 53,309,000 bearer shares held as treasury shares were cancelled in February 2022 when the necessary legal procedures
had been completed.
At 31 December 2022 the Company did not hold any non-voting equity securities (2021: none). During 2022 and 2021 the
Company neither purchased nor sold non-voting equity securities.
Article 659b of the revised Swiss Code of Obligations (CO) effective as of 1 January 2023 requires the creation of an additional
legal reserve for own equity instruments held by subsidiaries over which the Company as parent company of the Roche Group
has control, including foundations as included in the IFRS consolidation scope which did not qualify as subsidiaries under Article
659b CO effective on 31 December 2022. At 31 December 2022 such foundations held 19,811 bearer shares and 10,053,218
non-voting equity securities at cost of CHF 3,322 million. In accordance with Article 659b of the revised CO the Company will
record a legal reserve for own equity instruments of CHF 3,322 million in January 2023, which will be included within legal
retained earnings.180 Roche Holding Ltd, Basel | Notes to the Financial Statements Finance Report 2022

Statutory Auditor’s Report
To the General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd (the Company), which comprise the balance sheet as at
31 December 2022, and the income statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a
summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the financial statements (pages 175–184) comply with Swiss law and the Company’s articles of incorporation.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities under
those provisions and standards are further described in the ’Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements’
section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law, together with
the requirements of the Swiss audit profession and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial
statements of the current period. We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report.
Other Information
The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in
the finance report and the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial
statements of the Company, the compensation report and our auditor’s reports thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are
required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.186 Roche Holding Ltd, Basel | Statutory Auditor’s Report Finance Report 2022
Board of Directors’ Responsibilities for the Financial Statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Swiss
law and the Company’s articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but
to do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional
scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.
— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.
— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made.
— Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
We communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.
We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that were
of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We
describe these matters in our auditor’s report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.Finance Report 2022 Statutory Auditor’s Report | Roche Holding Ltd, Basel 187
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and PS-CH 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has
been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.
We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the Company’s articles
of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

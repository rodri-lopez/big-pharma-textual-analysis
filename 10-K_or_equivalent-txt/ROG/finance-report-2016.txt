CER (Constant Exchange Rates): The percentage changes at Constant Exchange Rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the 2016 and 2015 results at constant
exchange rates (the average rates for the year ended 31 December 2015). For the definition of CER see page 144. Financial position
Core results and Core EPS (earnings per share): These exclude non-core items such as global restructuring plans and amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
Net working capital increased by 4% (CER), due to an increase in receivables driven by increased sales and due to higher inventories.
This allows an assessment of both the actual results and the underlying performance of the business. A full income statement for the Group and the operating results of the divisions

net operating assets was offset at Group level by the natural hedge from the Group’s US dollar-denominated debt. The exchange rates
used are given on page 27.
In the Pharmaceuticals Division net working capital was stable at CER. There was an increase in trade receivables in line with sales growth.
Underlying inventory levels remained stable overall, excluding the final unwind of the Esbriet inventory fair value adjustment. An increase
in inventories for launch preparations was offset by inventory write-downs. Payables increased as a result of further conversion of
vendors to extended payment terms. Long-term net operating assets were lower mainly due to amortisation and due to an impairment
of one compound acquired as part of the Seragon acquisition. In Diagnostics the increase in net working capital of 10% at CER was
driven by an increase in inventories due to higher demand in emerging markets and the preparation for new launches. Trade receivables
increased due to sales growth in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions. Payables increased since the end of 2015 as a result of
optimisation measures. Long-term net operating assets increased mainly due to continued capital expenditure.

Pharmaceuticals Division operating results
The growth of 8% in the HER2 franchise resulted from increased demand for Perjeta and Herceptin in combination therapy and continued
uptake of Kadcyla. Sales increases in immunology mainly came from increasing use of Actemra/RoActemra in Europe and the US, and
from Xolair and Esbriet sales in the US. MabThera/Rituxan sales continued to grow, especially in the US, China and Germany. Avastin sales
Pharmaceuticals Division operating results were stable with the lower US sales offset by growth in the International region, particularly in China. Sales in the US, notably of MabThera/
Rituxan and Herceptin, were negatively impacted by an increase in reserves for mandatory discounts to hospitals under the 340B Drug

Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc depreciated significantly
against the Japanese yen and also against the US dollar and the Brazilian real, resulting in a positive translation impact on net operating
assets. The exchange rates used are given on page 27.
Net working capital. There was an increase in trade receivables, in line with sales growth. Inventory levels overall remained stable
compared to the end of 2015, excluding the final unwind of CHF 167 million for the Esbriet inventory fair value adjustment. An increase in
inventories for launch preparations was offset by inventory write-downs. Payables increased since the end of 2015 as a result of further
conversion of vendors to longer payment terms.
Long-term net operating assets. Overall long-term net operating assets were 2% lower. Property, plant and equipment has increased
due to manufacturing investments in the US, Switzerland, Germany and Chugai and in the US. Site development continued in Switzerland
at the Basel and Kaiseraugst sites and also at the South San Francisco campus in line with the sites’ master plans. The decrease in
intangible assets mainly due to amortisation and an impairment of one compound acquired as part of the Seragon acquisition. Provisions
decreased due to the reversal of contingent consideration provisions and the utilisation of restructuring provisions, mainly related to
restructuring of the division’s manufacturing network.

The decrease of 17% at CER was driven by lower royalty income, notably in Molecular Diagnostics, due to the base effect of back royalty
payments in 2015 as well as expiry of a PCR technology patent. Core costs decreased by 13% at CER due to the income from Swiss pension plan changes in 2016. Excluding this, core costs increased
by 4%. Administration costs grew by 14% due to the sequencing business and to newly established affiliates in the Diabetes Care

related to site closures and initiatives to harmonise processes and systems.

Net working capital. Net trade working capital increased by 7% at CER. Trade receivables increased mainly due to sales growth in the
Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions. Inventories increased by 15% due to higher demand in emerging markets and due to preparation
for new launches. Trade payables increased by 14% compared to the end of 2015 as a result of optimisation measures. The net liability
for other receivables/payables increased due to increased employee benefit accruals.
Long-term net operating assets. The increase of 2% at CER was due to increased property, plant and equipment and decreased

site expansion in China, the US and Germany, as well as site infrastructure development in Germany, US, China and Switzerland.
Provisions decreased following the payment of milestones related to acquisitions. The 4% decrease in goodwill and intangible assets
was mainly due to amortisation.

In 2016 compared to 2015, the Swiss franc was weaker against a number of currencies, in particular the Japanese yen, the US dollar and
the euro. The appreciation of the major currencies relevant to the Group resulted in a total positive foreign exchange impact on the income
statement compared to a negative impact in 2015. For 2016 sales these developments resulted in a positive impact of 1 percentage point,
equivalent to CHF 0.6 billion. The currency translation gain on the operating profit is 1 percentage point mainly from the appreciation of
the Japanese yen and the US dollar. The sensitivity of Group sales and core operating profit to a 1% change in average foreign currency
exchange rates against the Swiss franc during 2016 is shown in the table below.

The Group’s revenues are primarily generated from sales of products to customers. Such revenues are mainly received in the local
currency of the customer’s home market, although in certain emerging markets invoicing is made in major international currencies such
as the US dollar and euro. The costs of sales and marketing and also some administration costs follow the same currency pattern as
sales. The majority of research and development activities are incurred at the Group’s global research facilities, and therefore the costs
are mainly concentrated in US dollars, Swiss francs and euros. General and administration costs tend to be incurred mainly at central
locations in the US, Switzerland and Germany. Chugai’s revenues and costs are denominated in Japanese yen.

International Financial Reporting Standards
At 31 December 2016 the Group has a net debt position of CHF 13.2 billion (2015: CHF 14.1 billion). The financial assets of the Group are
managed in a conservative way with the objective to meet the Group’s financial obligations at all times. The Roche Group has been using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to report its consolidated results since 1990.
In 2016 the Group has implemented various minor amendments to existing standards and interpretations, which have no material impact

Liquidity risk. Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time.
The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements at any
point in time. In addition to the current liquidity position, the Group has good cash generation ability. Those future cash flows will be
used to repay debt instruments in the coming years.

there is a triggering event that provides evidence that an asset may be impaired. To assess whether any impairment exists, estimates of

rates, the planned use of buildings, machinery or equipment or closure of facilities, the presence of competition, technical obsolescence
and lower than anticipated product sales could lead to shorter useful lives or impairment.

Impairment testing
Pharmaceuticals Division. The division’s operating segments are the cash-generating units used for the testing of goodwill. Part of the
goodwill arising from the Foundation Medicine acquisition is recorded and monitored at a Roche Pharmaceuticals level as it relates to the
strategic development of Roche Pharmaceuticals. Therefore the cash-generating unit for this strategic goodwill is Roche Pharmaceuticals.
The recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. For Chugai and
Foundation Medicine the fair value less costs of disposal is determined with reference to the publicly quoted share prices of Chugai and
Foundation Medicine shares.

certain arrangements covering the future operation and governance of Chugai. Amongst other matters these cover the following areas:
• The structuring of the alliance.
• Roche’s rights as a shareholder.
• Roche’s rights to nominate members of Chugai’s Board of Directors.
• Certain limitations to Roche’s ability to buy or sell Chugai’s common stock.
Chugai issues additional shares of common stock in connection with its convertible debt and equity compensation plans, and may issue
additional shares for other purposes, which affects Roche’s percentage ownership interest. The Basic Alliance Agreement provides,
amongst other matters, that Chugai will guarantee Roche’s right to maintain its shareholding percentage in Chugai at not less than 50.1%.

is an under-funding, this may be remedied by various measures such as increasing employee and company contributions, lowering
the interest rate on retirement account balances, reducing prospective benefits and a suspension of the early withdrawal facility.
24. Employee benefits
In 2016 operating income of CHF 426 million was recorded for past service costs from changes to the Group’s pension plans in
Switzerland that were announced in June 2016. This represents the impact of the adjustment of the pension liability for plan changes.
Of this amount, CHF 310 million was recorded in the Pharmaceuticals Division, CHF 77 million in the Diagnostics Division and
Employee remuneration in millions of CHF CHF 39 million in Corporate. The past service income was recorded within general and administration. As part of the adjustments to
the pension plans in Switzerland, the Group made payments of CHF 165 million to the pension funds.

Actuarial assumptions
The actuarial assumptions used in these financial statements are based on the requirements set out in IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’.
They are unbiased and mutually compatible estimates of variables that determine the ultimate cost of providing post-employment
benefits. They are set on an annual basis by local management, based on advice from actuaries, and are subject to approval by corporate
management and the Group’s actuaries. Actuarial assumptions consist of demographic assumptions on matters such as mortality
and employee turnover, and financial assumptions on matters such as interest rates, salary and benefit levels, inflation rates and costs
of medical benefits. The actuarial assumptions vary based upon local economic and social conditions. The actuarial assumptions used
in the various statutory valuations may differ from these based on local legal and regulatory requirements.

Master netting agreements. The Group enters into derivative transactions and collateral agreements under International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements with the respective counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty risk.
Under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same
currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria
for offsetting in the balance sheet as the Group does not have a currently enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, because
the right to offset is only enforceable on the occurrence of future events, such as a default or other credit events.
Contract terms. At 31 December 2016 there are no significant financial assets whose terms have been renegotiated (2015: none).
Impairment losses. During 2016 total impairment losses for available-for-sale financial assets amounted to CHF 10 million
(2015: CHF 10 million).

reducing the exposure to potential future movements in such rates.
Interest rate risk
The Group mainly raises debt on a fixed rate basis for bonds and notes. The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates, mainly
for its US dollar, Swiss franc and euro floating rate financial instruments. The primary objective of the Group’s interest rate management

Depending on the interest rate environment of major currencies, the Group will use these instruments to generate an appropriate mix
of fixed and floating rate exposures.

law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and
maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal control.
— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances.
— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made.
— Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or,
if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as
a going concern.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of management override
of controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that internal control may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Roche Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as

Free cash flow is used to assess the Group’s ability to generate the cash required to conduct and maintain its operations. It also indicates – Investments in property, plant and equipment (4,144) (3,468)
the Group’s ability to generate cash to finance dividend payments, repay debt and to undertake merger and acquisition activities. – Investments in intangible assets (1,001) (642)
The free cash flow concept is used in the internal management of the business. – Disposal of property, plant and equipment 151 45

Operating free cash flow is calculated based on the IFRS operating profit and adjusted for certain cash items, movements in net working – Interest paid (849) (967)

from cash flows from operating activities as defined by IAS 7 in that it includes capital expenditures (which is within the responsibility of Other treasury items (28) 117
divisional management) and excludes income taxes paid (which is not within the responsibility of divisional management). Cash outflows Free cash flow 9,130 10,306
from defined benefit plans are allocated to the operating free cash flow based on the current service cost with the residual allocated to
treasury activities.
Free cash flow is calculated as the operating free cash flow adjusted for treasury activities and taxes paid. Free cash flow is different
from total cash flows as defined by IAS 7 in that it excludes dividend payments, cash inflows/outflow from financing activities such
as issuance/repayment of debt, purchase/sale of marketable securities and cash inflows/outflows from mergers, acquisitions and
divestments.
The Group refined the calculation of free cash flow in 2016 to exclude dividends, in line with its peer group. The free cash flow for 2015
has been restated accordingly, resulting in an increase of CHF 6,954 million to the free cash flow for that period. There was no impact on
the operating free cash flow from this change.

Constant exchange rates
Certain percentage changes in the Financial Review have been calculated using constant exchange rates (CER) which allow for an
assessment of the Group’s financial performance with the effects of exchange rate fluctuations eliminated. The percentage changes Price development of non-voting equity security (Genussschein) in CHF
at constant exchange rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the current reported period and the prior period
numbers at constant currency exchange rates, equalling the average exchange rates for the prior year. For example, a CER change 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016
between a 2016 line item and its 2015 equivalent is calculated using the average exchange rate for the year ended 31 December 2015 for 300
both the 2016 line item and the 2015 line item and subsequently calculating the change in percent with respect to the two recalculated 250
numbers. 200
150
Foreign exchange gains and losses are excluded from the calculation of CER growth rates in the earning per share calculations. 100
In countries where there is a significant devaluation in the local currency in the current year, the simulations use the average exchange 50
rate of the current year instead of the prior year to avoid that CER growth rates are artificially inflated. 0

At 31 December 2016 members of the Corporate Executive Committee as shown in the table below held PSP awards from the PSP
performance cycles 2015–2017 and 2016–2018. The terms and vesting conditions of these awards are disclosed in Note 26 to the Roche
Group Annual Financial Statements and additional supplementary information is in the Remuneration Report included in the Annual
Report on pages 124 to 150. Each award will result in between zero and two non-voting equity securities or shares (before value
adjustment), depending upon the achievement of the performance targets and the discretion of the Board of Directors. After vesting,
the non-voting equity securities or shares may remain blocked for up to ten years. At the end of the 2014–2016 cycle the performance
targets were not achieved and accordingly the participants received none of the originally targeted non-voting equity securities.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing
Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions Ian Starkey Marc Ziegler

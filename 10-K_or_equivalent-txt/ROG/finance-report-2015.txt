CER (Constant Exchange Rates): The percentage changes at Constant Exchange Rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the 2015 and 2014 results at constant
exchange rates (the average rates for the year ended 31 December 2014).
Core results and Core EPS (earnings per share): These exclude non-core items such as global restructuring plans and amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
This allows a transparent assessment of both the actual results and the underlying performance of the business. A full income statement for the Group and the operating results of

On the cover
By running the most stringent controls for our medicines we ensure that products which are provided to patients
meet all the respective production criteria. Here, Stefan Kamber, an in-process-control expert at the Roche Solids
Production unit in Basel, conducts one of the multiple checks of Cotellic, our new cancer medicine which was
approved by the FDA and the European Commission in November 2015.Finance – 2015 in brief
Roche in 2015
The Roche Group reported strong overall results in 2015. Sales grew by 5% at constant exchange rates (CER) while core earnings per share
increased by 4%. Excluding the impact of the one-time income in 2014 from the divestment of the filgrastim franchise rights, underlying core
earnings grew at 7%.
Sales
Group sales increased by 5% (CER) to CHF 48.1 billion (1% growth in CHF terms).
Pharmaceuticals sales growth was 5% (CER) due to continued strong growth in the HER2 franchise and Avastin in the oncology portfolio.
In immunology sales of Esbriet and Actemra/RoActemra increased. Sales of Pegasys decreased due to competition from a new generation
of treatments and Valcyte/Cymevene and Xeloda decreased due to generic competition.
Diagnostics sales showed growth of 6% (CER) with Professional Diagnostics being the major contributor.
Operating results
Core operating profit increased by 5% (CER) to CHF 17.5 billion (1% decline in CHF terms). Excluding the one-time income in 2014 from
the divestment of the filgrastim franchise rights, underlying core operating profit grew at 7%.
Research and development expenditure grew by 5% (CER) to CHF 9.3 billion on a core basis, with focus on the oncology, immunology
and neuroscience therapeutic areas. Research and development costs were 19.4% of Group sales.
IFRS operating results include non-core expenses of CHF 3.7 billion. The major factors are CHF 1.7 billion for the amortisation of intangible
assets, and CHF 1.2 billion from global restructuring plans, notably the Pharmaceuticals Division’s strategic realignment of its manufacturing
network.
Non-operating results
Core net financial expenses increased by CHF 0.3 billion to CHF 1.4 billion, driven by lower income from divestments of equity securities.
IFRS net financial expenses additionally includes a loss of CHF 0.4 billion from a major debt restructuring.
Net income
IFRS net income increased by 4% at CER to CHF 9.1 billion (5% decline in CHF terms).
Core earnings per share increased by 4% at CER (–6% in CHF terms). Excluding the one-time income in 2014 from the divestment of
the filgrastim franchise rights, underlying earnings per share grew at 7%.
Cash flows
Operating free cash flow was CHF 14.9 billion, a decrease of 7% at CER (–6% in CHF terms). The growth in the operating profit was offset
by higher capital investments and a lower increase in accounts payable.
Free cash flow decreased by 41% at CER (–37% in CHF terms) to CHF 3.4 billion, driven by the operating free cash flow decline and higher tax
and dividend payments.
Acquisitions, notably the majority stake in Foundation Medicine and the Ariosa and Kapa acquisitions in the Diagnostics sequencing business,
utilised in total CHF 2.1 billion of cash.
Financial position
Net working capital decreased by 11% (CER), due to an increase in payables since the end of 2014.
Net debt was stable at CHF 14.1 billion, as the free cash flow was largely absorbed by acquisitions. Net debt as a percentage of total assets
was 19%.
Credit ratings strong: Moody’s at A1 and Standard & Poor’s at AA.
Shareholder return
Dividends. A proposal will be made to increase dividends by 1% to CHF 8.10 per share. This will represent the 29th consecutive year of dividend
growth and will result in a pay-out ratio of 60.0%, subject to AGM approval.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) was 6% representing a combined performance of share and non-voting equity security.Roche Group

The Roche Group’s results for 2015 showed sales growth and core operating profit growth of 5% at constant exchange rates (CER).
Sales increased driven by the oncology and immunology portfolios, especially the medicines for HER2-positive breast cancer, and by
the Professional Diagnostics business. Core EPS grew at a lower rate than sales due to the base effect of the one-time income in 2014
from the divestment of the filgrastim franchise rights. Excluding this item, core operating profit and core EPS both grew ahead of sales
at 7%. Operating free cash flow was CHF 14.9 billion or 30.9% of sales, a decrease of 7% at CER due to increased capital expenditure,
investments in intangible assets as well as a higher increase in net working capital.
Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division rose by 5% to CHF 37.3 billion. This increase was driven by the oncology portfolio, especially by
the HER2 franchise which grew by 19%. Avastin sales were 9% higher with increased use in recently launched indications. Sales in
immunology grew by 24%, with Actemra/RoActemra and Xolair increasing by 23% and 25% respectively. There was a strong uptake for
Esbriet following its US launch. Sales of Pegasys declined due to competition from a new generation of treatments and sales of Valcyte/
Cymevene and Xeloda fell due to generic competition. Tamiflu sales fell due to a relatively mild influenza season. All regions showed
growth in Pharmaceuticals sales, with the US being most significant. Diagnostics sales grew at 6% to CHF 10.8 billion, further securing
the Division’s leading market position. The major growth area was Professional Diagnostics, with sales increasing by 8% led by the
immunodiagnostics business. Molecular Diagnostics and Tissue Diagnostics increased by 10% and 12% respectively while sales in
Diabetes Care decreased by 3% due to the continued challenging market environment in the US.
Core operating profit increased by 5% in the Pharmaceuticals Division and fell by 2% in the Diagnostics Division. In the Pharmaceuticals
Division growth in the underlying business more than compensated for the base effect of the divestment income of CHF 428 million from
the filgrastim franchise rights in 2014. Excluding this item, core operating profit in Pharmaceuticals increased by 8%. Manufacturing
costs were higher due to capacity expansion and sourcing strategy in biologics, together with higher inventory write-offs. Marketing and
distribution costs grew by 4% due to the launch and rollout of new products, notably the recently acquired product Esbriet. In research
and development there were continued investments in oncology and the immunology, inflammation and respiratory therapeutic areas.
In Diagnostics core operating profit was lower by 2% mainly due to the higher sales being more than offset by costs from the sequencing
business and increased research and development costs in Professional Diagnostics. Diabetes Care performance was impacted by
further price erosion in major markets such as the US.
Operating free cash flow was CHF 14.9 billion, a decrease of 7% at CER and 6% in CHF terms. The continuous strong operating cash
generation was offset by capital investments in manufacturing facilities and other site development projects, notably in Switzerland,
the US and Germany, by an increased level of in-licensing activities and a lower increase in accounts payable. The free cash flow was
CHF 3.4 billion with the decrease relative to 2014 mainly driven by the lower operating free cash flow, higher tax payments and higher
annual dividend payments.
Roche Finance Report 2015 | 3Roche Group | Financial Review
IFRS net income grew by 4% at CER compared to the increase of 1% in core net income. In addition to the items described above
in the core results, the 2014 IFRS results include a base effect from the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in that year of
CHF 1.6 billion, net of tax.
In 2015 the Swiss franc appreciated against a number of currencies, in particular against the euro, the Japanese yen and against most
Latin American and European currencies. These effects were partly offset by the stronger US dollar relative to the average rate in 2014.
The overall impact is negative on the growth rates expressed in Swiss francs compared to constant exchange rates, with a 4 percentage
point impact on sales, a 6 percentage point impact on core operating profit and a 10 percentage point impact on Core EPS. The currency
translation sensitivity of the Group’s results to movements in foreign currency exchange rates is included on page 26.

Sales
In 2015 sales increased by 5% at CER (+1% in CHF; –2% in USD) to CHF 48.1 billion. Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division rose 5%
to CHF 37.3 billion, driven by growth in medicines for HER2-positive breast cancer, as well as by Avastin, Esbriet, MabThera/Rituxan
and Actemra/RoActemra. Avastin sales grew by 9% driven by increased use in recently launched indications. In immunology there
was a strong uptake of Esbriet following its US launch in late 2014 and also for the subcutaneous formulation of Actemra/Roactemra.
Sales of Xolair increased by 25%. Pharmaceuticals sales increased in all regions, and particularly in the US where the HER2 franchise
grew by 19%. Sales of Pegasys declined due to competition from a new generation of treatments, while Valcyte/Cymevene and Xeloda
sales declined as both products are now off-patent in the US, with Xeloda additionally off-patent in Europe. Tamiflu sales fell due to the
relatively mild influenza season in late 2015 compared to the severe influenza season in the comparative period of 2014. Sales of Lucentis
declined due to strong competition. The Diagnostics Division sales were CHF 10.8 billion, an increase of 6% at CER, and the Division
retains its leading market position. The major growth area was Professional Diagnostics, which represents more than half of the Division’s
sales and grew by 8%, led by the immunodiagnostics business. Sales in Molecular Diagnostics and Tissue Diagnostics increased by 10%
and 12% respectively. Diabetes Care sales decreased by 3% due to continuing US reimbursement cuts and pricing pressure.

Core operating results
Pharmaceuticals Division. The Division’s core operating profit increased 5% at CER, in line with the 5% sales increase, as cost growth
was contained in line with the increased sales. The lower royalties and other operating income were driven by the one-off income of
CHF 428 million in 2014 for the divestment of the filgrastim franchise rights. Excluding this income, the Division’s core operating profit
grew at 8%.
Diagnostics Division. Core operating profit was down by 2% at CER, compared to the 6% sales increase. The increased costs from
the recently acquired companies in the sequencing business more than offset the growth of the underlying business. Diabetes Care was
impacted by price erosion in major markets like the US.
Roche Finance Report 2015 | 5Roche Group | Financial Review
Acquisitions
During 2015 the Roche Group completed the acquisition of several companies, including some previously announced in 2014. The
total cost of the acquired net assets was CHF 2.3 billion in cash and CHF 0.6 billion from the fair value of contingent consideration
arrangements.
On 7 April 2015 the Pharmaceuticals Division acquired a 61.3% controlling interest in Foundation Medicine (‘FMI’) for USD 1.0 billion.
The transaction further advances FMI’s market-leading position in molecular information and genomic analysis while providing the
Group with a unique opportunity to optimise the identification and development of novel treatment options for cancer patients. The
Pharmaceuticals Division also completed the acquisition of Trophos. In Diagnostics the Division acquired GeneWeave Biosciences in
Molecular Diagnostics and, in the sequencing business, Ariosa Diagnostics, Signature Diagnostics, CAPP Medical and Kapa Biosystems.
On 29 September 2014 the Pharmaceuticals Division acquired a 100% controlling interest in InterMune for USD 8.8 billion. The acquisition
added a new medicine for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Esbriet, to the Roche portfolio. Non-core costs in 2015 relating to InterMune
included intangible asset amortisation of CHF 1.1 billion and an expense of CHF 552 million from the release of the inventory fair value
adjustment. The Group issued USD 5.75 billion of debt in 2014 to finance the transaction.
In the 2014 Annual Financial Statements the accounting for the InterMune, Dutalys and Bina acquisitions was provisional based on
preliminary information and valuations of the assets and liabilities. These valuations were finalised in 2015 and as a result the comparative
balance sheet information at 31 December 2014 has been restated.
Contingent consideration provisions have increased by CHF 677 million to CHF 1.5 billion in 2015, mainly due to new provisions of
CHF 567 million arising from the 2015 acquisitions. In addition there was a net increase in provisions of CHF 192 million, which was
recorded as a general and administration expense, mainly due to the progression of the lead product candidate from the Seragon
acquisition. This was partially offset by payments of CHF 119 million, mainly related to the IQuum acquisition.
Further details are given in Notes 5, 20 and 29 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Global restructuring plans
During 2015 the Group continued with the implementation of several major global restructuring plans initiated in prior years, notably
the programme in the Diagnostics Division’s Diabetes Care business. On 12 November 2015 the Pharmaceuticals Division announced
a strategic realignment of its manufacturing network, including exiting from four sites. Total costs in 2015 of CHF 1.2 billion were
considerably higher than the 2014 costs of CHF 0.8 billion. This is due to the strategic realignment of the Pharmaceuticals Division’s
manufacturing network with costs of CHF 0.6 billion in 2015.

Diagnostics Division. On 26 September 2013 Roche Diabetes Care announced the ‘Autonomy and Speed’ initiative which will enable
the business to focus on Diabetes Care’s specific requirements, speed up processes and decision-making and drive efficiencies. In 2015
costs of CHF 175 million were incurred, mainly for consultancy and IT-related costs as well as employee-related costs. Spending on other
smaller plans within the Division was CHF 126 million and included costs related to certain IT projects and the restructuring of the former
Applied Science business.
Site consolidation. On 12 November 2015 the Pharmaceuticals Division announced a strategic realignment of its manufacturing network
including exiting from the manufacturing sites at Clarecastle, Ireland; Leganés, Spain; Segrate, Italy; and Florence, US. Costs for this
plan are expected to be in the order of CHF 1.6 billion, of which up to CHF 0.6 billion will be in cash. The plan is expected to run until
2021 and approximately 1,200 positions will be affected. Costs from this plan in 2015 were CHF 602 million, of which CHF 182 million
were non-cash write-downs and accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment. Additional costs were recorded in the
Pharmaceuticals Division for the outsourcing of logistics at the Rosny site in France and the closure of the manufacturing site at Toluca,
Mexico. The divestment plans for the Nutley site are on track.
Other global restructuring plans. The major items were CHF 62 million from the Pharmaceuticals Division research and development
strategic realignment and CHF 55 million from various initiatives to reduce the field force in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.
Further details are given in Note 6 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
There were only minor impairments in 2015. In the Pharmaceuticals Division impairment charges totalled CHF 69 million relating to
decisions to stop development of various compounds and a collaboration project with different alliance partners. There were no
impairments in the Diagnostics Division.
Total impairment charges recorded against goodwill and intangible assets in 2014 were CHF 1.9 billion. The major part of this was in the
Tissue Diagnostics business with impairment charges of CHF 552 million against goodwill and CHF 643 million against product intangible
assets.
Further details are given in Notes 8 and 9 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Legal and environmental settlements
The legal and environmental settlements include the provision of CHF 107 million for the remediation costs at the Clarecastle production
site in Ireland following the strategic realignment of the Pharmaceuticals Division’s manufacturing network. There were no other
significant developments in 2015. Further details are given in Note 19 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Major debt restructuring
As a result of attractive financing conditions on capital markets the Group decided in September 2015 to restructure part of its debt.
This consisted of the refinancing of USD 0.9 billion of notes with coupons of 5.25%–7.00% originally due in 2019–2039 and EUR 0.4 billion
of notes with coupons of 6.50% originally due in 2021 with the issuance of USD 1.0 billion of notes due in 2025 with coupons of 3.00%.
This major debt restructuring resulted in a loss of CHF 381 million. Further details are given in Note 20 to the Annual Financial
Statements.
Treasury and taxation
Core financing costs were CHF 1.1 billion, a decrease of 17%, mainly due to losses on debt redemption and interest costs being lower
than in 2014. Core other financial expenses were CHF 276 million, reflecting a net foreign exchange loss of CHF 386 million mainly arising
from Venezuela and Argentina, partially offset by CHF 118 million of net income from equity securities. Core tax expenses increased by
9% to CHF 4.3 billion and the Group’s effective core tax rate increased to 26.6% compared to 24.1% in 2014. This was mainly due to the
higher percentage of core profit contribution coming from tax jurisdictions with higher local tax rates than the average Group tax rate,
notably in the US.

Net income and earnings per share
IFRS net income and diluted EPS both decreased by 5% in CHF terms. At CER the IFRS income increased by 4% and diluted EPS increased
by 7%. Core net income increased by 1% and Core EPS increased by 4% at CER. The core basis excludes non-core items such as global
restructuring costs, amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and alliance and business combination costs. Excluding
the income in 2014 from the divestment of the filgrastim franchise rights of CHF 428 million and the related tax effects of CHF 93 million,
underlying Core EPS grew at 7% at CER.

1) As disclosed in Note 5 to the Annual Financial Statements, the balance sheet at 31 December 2014 has been restated following the finalisation of the net assets acquired related
to the InterMune, Dutalys and Bina acquisitions in 2014. A reconciliation to the previously published balance sheet is provided in Note 5.

Compared to the start of 2015 the Swiss franc appreciated against most currencies, notably the euro and the Brazilian real, which resulted
overall in a negative translation impact on balance sheet positions. The US dollar ended the year at the same rate against the Swiss franc
as at the beginning of the year and therefore had little translation impact on balance sheet positions. The exchange rates used are given on
page 26.
In the Pharmaceuticals Division net working capital decreased by 18% at CER due to an increase in other payables since the end of 2014
due to the exercise of a purchase option for offices in South San Francisco. In addition trade receivables decreased, mainly in the US,
as a consequence of lower Tamiflu sales at the end of 2015 and good collections. Inventory levels rose by 2% due to the expansion of
production capacities including deliveries from external manufacturing partners and also due to higher sales volumes in both new and
established products. Long-term net operating assets increased as a result of the goodwill and intangible assets from the Foundation
Medicine and Trophos acquisitions and higher capital expenditure as well as for the purchase option exercise for offices in South
San Francisco. In Diagnostics the increase in net working capital of 4% was a result of the strong sales performance in 2015 as well
as challenging political and economic situations which resulted in an increase of 9% in inventories and 9% in account receivables.
Long-term net operating assets increased due to the intangible assets and goodwill from the various acquisitions in 2015.
Net debt was stable at CHF 14.1 billion as the free cash flow was largely absorbed by acquisitions. The net pension liability decreased
by CHF 0.6 billion with the main driver being the translation of the euro-denominated unfunded plans in Germany into Swiss francs on
consolidation. The net tax liabilities increased mainly due to the deferred tax effects from the acquisition accounting.

The Group’s operating free cash flow for 2015 was CHF 14.9 billion, a decrease of 7% at CER and 6% in CHF terms. The operating cash
generation was absorbed by higher investments in property, plant and equipment for site infrastructure and office development projects
and expansion of manufacturing facilities and by the increased in-licensing arrangements in the Pharmaceuticals Division. The free cash
flow of CHF 3.4 billion decreased significantly compared to 2014, due to the relatively lower operating free cash flow, higher tax payments
and the increase in the annual dividend.

Pharmaceuticals Division sales increased by 5% at CER, with strong growth in oncology and immunology products. Sales growth was
primarily driven by the following products: Herceptin, Avastin, Perjeta, Esbriet, MabThera/Rituxan, Actemra/RoActemra and Kadcyla.
These products together contributed CHF 3.2 billion at CER to sales growth.
The growth of 19% in the HER2 franchise resulted from increased demand for Perjeta and Herceptin in combination therapy and
continued uptake of Kadcyla. Avastin sales grew in all regions driven by increased use in recently launched indications. MabThera/
Rituxan sales also increased, notably in the US. Sales in immunology increased due to demand for Esbriet, following its US launch in
late 2014, due to the growth of Actemra/RoActemra in all regions in its subcutaneous formulation and Xolair, which grew by 25% due
to increasing uptake for the recently launched indication chronic idiopathic urticaria.
10 | Roche Finance Report 2015Financial Review | Roche Group
Sales of Pegasys declined due to competition from a new generation of treatments and sales of Valcyte/Cymevene and Xeloda fell due
to generic competition. Tamiflu sales were lower due to a relatively mild influenza season in late 2015 compared to the severe season in
late 2014, while sales of Lucentis declined due to strong competition.

Overall growth in the HER2 franchise was 19%. Herceptin sales grew 10% with continued strong growth in the US (+15%) resulting
from a longer duration of treatment in combination with Perjeta for both early and advanced breast cancer. Demand in the International
region grew strongly (+16%) with growth in all sub-regions. In Europe sales were stable. Perjeta grew in all regions, particularly in Europe
(+102%) and the US (+41%), where it was approved for use before surgery in early stage aggressive breast cancer. Kadcyla sales more
than doubled in Europe (+104%) with reimbursement granted in Italy, France and Spain and sales also increased in the International
region and in Japan.

Demand for Avastin was strong, with sales growth in all regions. US sales grew (+8%) driven by expanded use in the more recently
launched indications, cervical and ovarian cancer. In Europe sales grew (+4%) as a result of increasing treatment of ovarian, colorectal,
lung and cervical cancer. In the International region growth of 15% was driven mainly by phasing of deliveries to the public sector and
approval of new indications. In Japan sales increased by 14% due to increasing demand for use in breast and lung cancer.

Sales declined mainly as there was a relatively mild influenza season in the last quarter of 2015. This contrasts with the severe epidemic
influenza season in the US at the end of 2014. Sales decreased in Europe mainly due to lower governmental sales for pandemic
stockpiling compared to 2014, as well as in Japan due to higher seasonal demand in the fourth quarter of 2014.

1) Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa.
United States. Sales grew by 6% led by the HER2 breast cancer franchise (+19%). The leading products were the oncology medicines
MabThera/Rituxan, Avastin and Herceptin, with sales of CHF 3.8 billion (+7%), CHF 3.1 billion (+8%) and CHF 2.4 billion (+15%)
respectively. In addition there was strong demand for Esbriet and Xolair (+25%). Growth was negatively impacted by the sharp decline of
Valcyte/Cymevene (–78%) and Xeloda (–71%), which both are now off-patent in the US, as well as Lucentis (–15%) and Pegasys (–58%)
due to increased competition.
Europe. Sales increased by 4% with continued strong growth in the HER2 breast cancer franchise (+17%) and good uptake of Esbriet.
In addition there was continued sales growth of Actemra/RoActemra (+22%) and Avastin (+4%). This growth was partially offset by
lower Pegasys (–52%) and Tarceva (–18%) sales. Tamiflu sales were also lower (–76%) mainly due to 2014 pandemic stockpiling.
Japan. Sales grew by 6%, with the major growth drivers being Avastin (+14%), the HER2 franchise (+14%) and newly launched Alecensa
(alectinib). Avastin sales grew due to increased demand across its approved indications, in particular for use in breast and lung cancer.
Alecensa, for ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), was launched in Japan in September 2014 and had sales of CHF 64 million
for 2015. Sales of the osteoporosis medicine Edirol also increased (+21%).
International. Sales increased by 5% driven by the Latin America sub-region. Growth in Latin America was mainly due to the HER2
franchise (+21%) and other oncology products, especially Avastin (+21%) and MabThera/Rituxan (+5%). Actemra/RoActemra sales also
increased significantly (+28%), while sales of Pegasys (–33%) and Xeloda (–23%) declined. In Asia-Pacific, the main drivers of growth
were Herceptin (+21%), Avastin (+22%) and MabThera/Rituxan (+4%). Herceptin growth resulted from significant activities to ensure
patient access to the medicine in China. Total sales in the E7 key emerging markets grew by 7% with strong volume growth in Brazil
driven by market access activities and new product launches more than offsetting price decreases.

Income from disposal of products and other 178 564 –69
Total – IFRS and Core basis 2,119 2,273 –11
The decrease of 11% at CER was due to lower income from product disposals partly offset by higher out-licensing income. Income
fell due to the comparative period including CHF 428 million of income from the sale of the filgrastim franchise rights back to Amgen.
Excluding this item growth was 10%. Royalty income was stable due to the receipt of certain non-recurring royalties offsetting lower
royalties for Lucentis and Enbrel. The increase in out-licensing income was due to upfront and milestone payments from the exclusive
licence agreement with Galenica for the commercialisation of Mircera in the US and a payment from a collaboration partner for
a de-blocking amendment.

Core costs increased by 7% at CER. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased by 0.7 percentage points. The increase in
manufacturing cost of goods sold and period costs resulted mainly from the biologics manufacturing with capacity increases and sourcing
strategy. In addition, inventory write-downs increased by CHF 121 million. Royalty expenses were below 2014 due to lower Tamiflu sales.
Expenses from collaboration and profit-sharing agreements increased mainly driven by higher co-promotion expenses due to growing sales
of MabThera/Rituxan and Xolair. Non-core costs include CHF 495 million for the strategic realignment of the manufacturing network as well
as amortisation of the intangible assets from the InterMune acquisition and the release of the inventory fair value adjustment.

Esbriet following its US launch in late 2014 as well as to ensure increased patient access to medicines such as the HER2 franchise.
Marketing efforts continued to support established and launch products. Restructuring costs relate to productivity initiatives mainly
in Asia and Europe as well as the outsourcing of logistics from the Rosny site in France.

Core costs increased by 4% at CER and, as a percentage of sales, increased to 21.8% (2014: 21.5%). The oncology franchise remained
the primary area of research and development investments with advancement of cancer immunotherapy treatments. Activities also
increased in the immunology, inflammation and respiratory area driven by programmes for asthma, inflammatory bowel disease and
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In addition the Pharmaceuticals Division spent CHF 441 million on the in-licensing of pipeline compounds
and technologies, which are capitalised as intangible assets. Global restructuring costs mainly result from the Pharmaceuticals Division
research and development strategic realignment, notably the transfer of oncology discovery from Penzberg, Germany to Zurich,
Switzerland. There were impairment charges of CHF 69 million resulting from decisions to stop development on four compounds with
different alliance partners and a decision to stop one collaboration project with an alliance partner.

Core costs decreased by 17% at CER due to the base effect of one-time double charge (US Branded Prescription Drug fee) with an
operating profit impact of CHF 202 million in 2014. As a percentage of sales, costs fell to 3.5% from 4.3%. Administration costs decreased
by 2% due to lower management costs in the US. The alliance and business combination costs relate mainly to the additional contingent
consideration provisions recorded in respect of the Seragon acquisition (see Note 29 to Annual Financial Statements). Legal and
environmental settlements include the provision of CHF 107 million for remediation costs at the Clarecastle production site in Ireland as
part of the Pharmaceuticals Division’s strategic manufacturing realignment. Non-core costs in 2014 include an impairment of the goodwill
from the Marcadia acquisition following the exit from cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and impairments of dedicated goodwill related
to certain other previous acquisitions.

Pharmaceuticals Division total core operating profit and operating profit both include the elimination of CHF 38 million (2014: CHF 53 million) of unrealised inter-company profits
between Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai.
The fall in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen has a negative impact of approximately 8 percentage points on Chugai’s sales growth and
10 percentage points on the core operating profit growth when expressed in Swiss francs as compared to the growth rates in Japanese
yen. Sales to external customers by Chugai increased by 6% in Japanese yen and sales to Roche by Chugai were also significantly higher.
This resulted in an increase of 17% in Chugai core operating profit and an increase in Chugai’s operating profit margins, as the additional
revenues flowed through to increase the operating profit. Chugai’s operating free cash flow increased by 46% due to the increased
revenues and lower trade receivables which resulted from the timing of sales and improved customer payment terms.

1) As disclosed in Note 5 to the Annual Financial Statements, the balance sheet at 31 December 2014 has been restated following the finalisation of the net assets acquired related
to the InterMune, Dutalys and Bina acquisitions in 2014. A reconciliation to the previously published balance sheet is provided in Note 5.
The absolute amount of the movement between the 2015 and 2014 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2015 transactions (translated at average
rates for 2014) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2015 transactions include non-cash movements and therefore the movements in
this table are not the same as amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only includes the cash movements). A full consolidated balance sheet is given on page 39 of
the Annual Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given above is on page 136.
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of 2015 the Swiss franc appreciated against most
currencies, notably the euro and the Brazilian real, which resulted overall in a negative translation impact on net operating assets.
The US dollar ended the year at the same rate against the Swiss franc as at the beginning of the year and therefore had little translation
impact on balance sheet positions. The exchange rates used are given on page 26.
Net working capital. The decrease of 18% at CER was mainly due to an increase in other payables since the end of 2014 due to the
exercise of a purchase option for offices in South San Francisco. Trade receivables decreased compared to the end of 2014 mainly due
to lower Tamiflu sales in the US at the end of 2015 and good collections. The decrease in inventories from the release of the non-cash
InterMune inventory fair value adjustment was offset by an increase in inventory levels from the expansion of production capacities
including deliveries from external manufacturing partners. Inventory levels also rose to support the sales volume increases in both new
and established products.
Long-term net operating assets. These increased by 6% mainly due to significant additions to property, plant and equipment,
as well as goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of Foundation Medicine and Trophos. Property, plant and
equipment increased by 12% as investments continue to be made in site infrastructure and office development projects and expansion
of manufacturing facilities, in particular in Switzerland, the US and Germany. Property, plant and equipment increased following
the exercise of a purchase option for offices in South San Francisco. The 15% increase in provisions resulted mainly from higher
contingent consideration provisions from the Seragon acquisition and new restructuring provisions for the strategic realignment of
the manufacturing network.

The Pharmaceuticals Division’s operating free cash flow decreased to CHF 14.5 billion. The operating profit, net of operating cash
adjustments, decreased by 1% at CER. The strong operating performance was offset by higher capital expenditure and an increased level
of in-licensing transactions which led to a 5% decline in operating free cash flow. The increase in net working capital was mainly due
to a lower increase of accounts payable.

Sales
The Diagnostics Division continued to increase sales with a growth of 6% at CER to CHF 10.8 billion. Professional Diagnostics, with 8%
sales growth, was the main growth contributor led by its immunodiagnostics business. Molecular Diagnostics sales increased by 10%,
with growth in the underlying molecular businesses of 7% as well as in the genome sequencing business where sales doubled. Diabetes
Care sales decreased by 3% due to the continued challenging market environment, notably in the US. The growth in Tissue Diagnostics
was driven by the advanced staining product portfolio.

Professional Diagnostics. With an increase in sales of 8%, the business area was the major contributor to Divisional performance in
all regions, with growth being primarily driven by the immunodiagnostics business (+13%), which now represents 28% of Divisional sales.
This was also supported by the clinical chemistry (+3%) and coagulation monitoring (+6%) businesses. The Professional Diagnostics
business grew in all regions, but especially in Asia-Pacific (+17%) due to strong sales in China. The growth reported in the Europe,
Middle East and Africa (‘EMEA’) region of 4% was mainly due to the immunodiagnostics (+8%) and clinical chemistry businesses (+2%).

An improved version of the cobas h 232 Troponin T test was launched in June 2015 for use in prehospital and emergency care settings.
Diabetes Care. Sales decreased by 3% mainly due to challenging market conditions for the blood glucose monitoring portfolio in major
markets like the US. Sales of the Accu-Chek Mobile grew by 8% and lancing devices sales were up 5%. This sales growth outweighed
the negative impact of the phase-out of older products such as Accu-Chek Advantage and Accu-Chek Compact, as well as Accu-Chek
Aviva/Performa which decreased by 1%. The insulin delivery systems (IDS) business grew by 8%, driven by infusion systems and the
newly launched Accu-Chek Insight system. Sales in North America were down by 15% mainly due to the spillover of Medicare prices to
commercial plans in the US and due to reimbursement changes in Canada’s largest provinces. Sales in the EMEA region decreased by
2% with increased sales in Germany, the Nordics and in the Middle East more than offset by lower sales in Russia and Algeria. Sales grew
in the Latin America and Asia-Pacific regions, mainly driven by Argentina, Brazil, and India.

Further progress was made in the implementation of specific initiatives that Roche Diabetes Care started in 2013 with the goal to
streamline processes and decision-making and to drive efficiencies while continuing to develop innovative solutions.
Molecular Diagnostics. Sales rose 10% with growth in the underlying molecular businesses of 7%, with the major contributions
coming from the virology, the HPV (cervical cancer screening) and the genomics and oncology businesses. This was partly offset by
a sales decline in the blood screening business. Sales from the sequencing business, driven by NIPT (non-invasive prenatal testing),
also contributed to the overall growth. Regional growth was driven by EMEA (+14%) with increased sales coming from Germany, South
Africa and Turkey. Sales grew in North America (+11%) due to strong US sales.

sales increase in Asia-Pacific was mainly driven by increasing sales in China (+22%) resulting from governmental healthcare investments,
public demand and the Division’s expanding presence and wide portfolio. In the EMEA region, the Division’s largest market, sales
increased by 4% led by growth in Professional Diagnostics and Molecular Diagnostics. Sales in the Latin America region increased by
11%, driven by Professional Diagnostics and Diabetes Care. Sales in Japan remained stable with higher sales in Professional Diagnostics
compensating lower Molecular Diagnostics sales.

higher allowances for doubtful receivables in Southern Europe. On a core basis, marketing and distribution costs as a percentage of sales
were 23.5% compared to 22.9% in 2014. Global restructuring costs were mainly due to the reorganisation of the Diabetes Care business.

1) As disclosed in Note 5 to the Annual Financial Statements, the balance sheet at 31 December 2014 has been restated following the finalisation of the net assets acquired related
to the InterMune, Dutalys and Bina acquisitions in 2014. A reconciliation to the previously published balance sheet is provided in Note 5.
The absolute amount of the movement between the 2015 and 2014 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2015 transactions (translated at average
rates for 2014) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2015 transactions include non-cash movements and therefore the movements

of the Annual Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given above is on page 136.
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of 2015 the Swiss franc appreciated against most
currencies, notably the euro, which resulted overall in a negative translation impact on net operating assets. The Diagnostics Division has
a significant net asset position in euros so the appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro had a major impact. The US dollar ended
the year at the same rate against the Swiss franc as at the beginning of the year and therefore had little translation impact on balance
sheet positions. The exchange rates used are given on page 26.
Net working capital. Net trade working capital increased by 6% at CER. Inventories increased by 9% due to higher demand in emerging
markets, notably Brazil, Mexico and China. Trade payables increased by 25% as a result of improving payment terms with suppliers.
Trade receivables increased by 9% due to the sales growth and fewer factoring initiatives in Southern Europe in 2015.
Long-term net operating assets. The increase of 17% at CER was due to the increase in intangible assets and goodwill from the Ariosa,
Signature, CAPP Medical, GeneWeave and Kapa Biosystems acquisitions and various in-licensing arrangements. Property, plant and
equipment increased due to manufacturing site expansions in the US and Germany, as well as headquarter developments in Switzerland.
Provisions increased by 36% due to the contingent consideration provisions arising from the acquisitions.

The operating free cash flow of the Diagnostics Division decreased to CHF 0.9 billion. The cash generation of the business was more
than offset by increases in net working capital, which are noted above in the comments on the financial position. Property, plant and
equipment increased due to instrument placements and site development in Germany, the US and Switzerland. Increased investments
in intangible assets came from in-licensing arrangements.

General and administration costs were stable at CER. The change in net operating assets was mainly due to the utilisation of provisions
for remediation activities in Nutley, US and Grenzach, Germany. Corporate operating free cash flow showed a higher outflow mainly due
to the utilisation of these provisions.

In 2015 compared to 2014, the Swiss franc was stronger against most currencies, in particular the euro, the Japanese yen and against most
Latin American and European currencies. The US dollar appreciation partially offsets this negative impact. For sales, these developments
resulted in a negative growth impact of 4 percentage points, equivalent to CHF 1.8 billion when translated into Swiss francs. The currency
translation loss on the operating profit growth is 6 percentage points, mainly driven by the depreciation of the euro.
On 15 January 2015 the Swiss National Bank (SNB) announced that it was discontinuing the minimum exchange rate of 1.20 Swiss francs
per euro. As a consequence, stock markets in Switzerland fell significantly and the value of the Swiss franc increased. For the Roche
Group, no fundamental impact is foreseen. For example, the Group incurs less than 20% of its overall costs in Switzerland. By the same
token, key markets such as the US, Europe and Japan have complete value chains, meaning that costs are incurred in local currencies,
not in Swiss francs. See also Note 29 to the Annual Financial Statements. The Group uses the Swiss franc as the presentation currency in
its Annual Financial Statements and therefore a weakening of foreign currencies against the Swiss franc will have a negative currency
translation impact on the Group’s consolidated results when reported in Swiss francs. The sensitivity of Group sales and core operating
profit to a 1% change in average foreign currency exchange rates against the Swiss franc during 2015 is shown in the table below.

The Group’s revenues are primarily generated from sales of products to customers. Such revenues are mainly received in the local
currency of the customer’s home market, although in certain emerging markets invoicing is made in major international currencies such
as the US dollar and euro. The costs of sales and marketing and also some administration costs follow the same currency pattern as
sales. The majority of research and development activities are incurred at the Group’s global research facilities, and therefore the costs
are mainly concentrated in US dollars, Swiss francs and euros. General and administration costs tend to be incurred mainly at central
locations in the US, Switzerland and Germany. Chugai’s revenues and costs are denominated in Japanese yen.

Financing costs
In 2015 financing costs on an IFRS basis were 16% lower at CER mainly due to higher losses on debt redemption in 2014 and lower
interest expenses in 2015. Core financing costs were CHF 1,140 million, a decrease of CHF 222 million or 17% at CER compared to
2014. Interest expenses decreased by 9% due to the continued repayment of debt and despite the new debt issued for the InterMune
acquisition in 2014. The loss on early redemption of debt was CHF 79 million compared to CHF 215 million in 2014. The net interest
cost of defined benefit pension plans decreased by 8% to CHF 176 million due to lower discount rates partially offset by a decrease
in the funding status at the end of 2014. During 2015 the Group restructured part of its debt, resulting in a loss on repurchase of
CHF 381 million. A full analysis of financing costs is given in Note 3 to the Annual Financial Statements and details of the major debt
restructuring and other repayments and redemptions are given in Note 20.
Roche Finance Report 2015 | 27Roche Group | Financial Review
Other financial income (expense)
Core other financial income (expense) was a net expense of CHF 276 million compared to a net income of CHF 246 million in 2014.
Net income from equity securities was CHF 118 million as against CHF 330 million in the comparative period. The net foreign exchange
result reflects hedging costs and losses on unhedged positions. Net foreign exchange losses in the period of 2015 were CHF 386 million
compared to net losses of CHF 105 million in the same period of 2014. The 2015 results include a loss of CHF 254 million for Venezuela
and CHF 105 million for Argentina. A full analysis of other financial income (expense) is given in Note 3 to the Annual Financial
Statements.
Income taxes
The Group’s effective core tax rate increased by 2.5 percentage points to 26.6% in 2015 (2014: 24.1%). This was mainly due to the higher
percentage of core profit contribution coming from tax jurisdictions with higher local tax rates than the average Group tax rate, notably
in the US.

Financial position
The net debt position remained stable in 2015. The net pension liability decreased due to the translation of the euro-denominated
obligation of the Group’s plans in Germany. Net tax liabilities increased mainly due to the deferred tax effects from the newly acquired
companies. Interest payable relates mostly to bonds and notes with coupon payment dates in March and September, and the decline
is due to CHF 0.9 billion of coupon payments on bonds and notes during 2015, partly offset by interest accrued in the same period. At
31 December 2015 the Group held financial long-term assets with a market value of CHF 0.4 billion, which consist mostly of holdings in
biotechnology companies which were acquired in the context of licensing transactions or scientific collaborations. The US dollar ended
the year at the same rate against the Swiss franc as at the beginning of the year and therefore had little translation impact on the Group’s
US dollar-denominated debt when translated into Swiss francs on consolidation.
Free cash flow
The cash outflow from treasury activities increased by CHF 0.1 billion due to lower proceeds from sales of equity investments partly
offset by lower interest payments. Total taxes paid in 2015 were CHF 3.7 billion, an increase of 25% on the tax payments made in 2014,
which were relatively low due to tax prepayments made at the end of 2013. Total dividends paid in 2015 were CHF 7.0 billion, an increase
of CHF 0.2 billion compared to 2014, reflecting the 3% increase of the Roche Group annual dividend.

Operating free cash flow was CHF 14.9 billion, a decrease of 7% at CER (6% in CHF terms), mainly due to higher capital expenditure
on property, plant and equipment in Switzerland, the US and Germany, higher investments for in-licensing arrangements in the
Pharmaceuticals Division and increased net working capital.
The cash outflow from treasury activities increased, mainly due to lower proceeds from sales of equity investments in 2015. Total taxes
paid were CHF 3.7 billion, an increase due to the timing of tax prepayments. Total dividends paid were higher due to the 3% increase
of the annual Roche Group dividend.
The free cash flow of CHF 3.4 billion was lower than in 2014, due to the lower operating free cash flow, the higher tax payments and
the increase in the dividend.

1) US dollar-denominated debt includes those bonds and notes denominated in euros, Swiss francs and pounds sterling that were swapped into US dollars, and therefore in
the consolidated results they have economic characteristics equivalent to US dollar-denominated bonds and notes.
The net debt position of the Group at 31 December 2015 was CHF 14.1 billion, an increase of CHF 0.1 billion from 31 December 2014.
The free cash flow of CHF 3.4 billion, which includes the annual dividend payment of CHF 7.0 billion, was offset by the net cash outflow
of CHF 2.1 billion for acquisitions and the net outflow of CHF 0.4 billion on hedging and collateral arrangements. The US dollar ended
the year at the same rate against the Swiss franc as at the beginning of the year and therefore had little translation impact on the Group’s
US dollar-denominated debt when translated into Swiss francs on consolidation.
In 2009 the Group entered into derivative contracts with third parties to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from bonds and notes
issued in currencies other than US dollar. At the same time collateral agreements were entered with the derivative counterparties to
mitigate counterparty risk. In 2015 the cash collateral balance increased by CHF 0.4 billion. The collateral balance in relation to the
hedges on the non-US dollar-denominated bonds and notes is mainly sensitive to the foreign exchange rate between the US dollar
and the euro, but also to pound sterling. Currently the collateral balance moves by approximately USD 36 million if all of these foreign
exchange rates move by 1% simultaneously.
The issuance, redemption and repurchase of bonds and notes during 2015 (see Note 20 to the Annual Financial Statements) had
an impact on liquid funds, but had no impact on the net debt position.

Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions into a
separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions.
In 2015 expenses for the Group’s defined contribution plans were CHF 421 million (2014: CHF 364 million). All other plans are classified
as ‘defined benefit plans’, even if the Group’s potential obligation is minor or has a relatively remote possibility of arising. Plans are usually
established as trusts which are independent of the Group and are funded by payments from the Group and by employees, but in some
cases the plan is unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources.
Defined benefit plans
Expenses for the Group’s defined benefit plans were CHF 709 million (2014: CHF 586 million). The increase was mainly due to an increase
in the current service cost of CHF 137 million driven by lower discount rates at the beginning of 2015 compared to the beginning of 2014.
Based on the revised actuarial assumptions at the end of 2015, expenses for the Group’s defined benefit plans in 2016 are expected to
be approximately CHF 687 million driven by higher discount rates at the beginning of 2016. These estimates for 2016 pension expenses
do not include any settlement or past service/curtailment effects that might arise during the year.

Overall the funding status on an IFRS basis of the Group’s funded defined benefit plans is stable compared to the start of the year.
The funded status of the pension funds is monitored by the local pension fund governance bodies as well as being closely reviewed at
a Group level.
The unfunded plans are mainly those in the Group’s German affiliates, where the fully reserved pension obligations are invested in
the local affiliate’s operations. The unfunded liabilities for these plans decreased by CHF 0.8 billion due to an increase in the discount rates
in Germany and due to the translation of the euro-denominated unfunded plans in Germany into Swiss francs on consolidation.
Full details of the Group’s pensions and other post-employment benefits are given in Note 25 to the Annual Financial Statements.

Return (TSR), defined as share price growth plus dividends, measured in Swiss francs at actual exchange rates. At constant exchange
rates (CER) Roche ranked number 6, with the year-end return being 7% for Roche shares and 6% for Roche non-voting equity securities.
The combined performance of share and non-voting equity security was 6% compared to a weighted average return for the peer group
of 4% in CHF terms and 5% at CER.
The healthcare sector once again outperformed other key market sectors in 2015 despite continuing price and rising political pressure.
Roche shares performed in line to peers in 2015 in constant exchange rates with global macroeconomic concerns causing major volatility
throughout the year. Roche outperformed its peers, in CHF terms, and the Swiss Market Index, with positive news flow towards the end
of 2015 such as phase III results for ocrelizumab (multiple sclerosis) and a strong third quarter sales announcement and target upgrade.

Proposed dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing an increase of 1% in the dividend for 2015 to CHF 8.10 per share and non-voting equity security
(2014: CHF 8.00) for approval at the Annual General Meeting. This is the 29th consecutive increase in the dividend. If the dividend proposal
is approved by shareholders, dividend payments on the total shares and non-voting equity securities will amount to CHF 7.0 billion
(2014: CHF 6.9 billion), resulting in a pay-out ratio (based on core net income) of 60.0% (2014: 56.0%). Based on the prices at year-end 2015,
the dividend yield on the Roche share was 2.9% (2014: 3.0%) and the yield on the non-voting equity security was 2.9% (2014: 3.0%).

Debt
During 2015 there was the early partial redemption of USD 600 million of notes originally due 1 March 2019 that were redeemed
on 26 March 2015 following the exercise of an early-call option in December 2014, the redemption on the due date of 4 March 2015
of GBP 481 million of notes, the redemption on the due date of 15 July 2015 of USD 1.0 billion of notes and all of the notes redeemed
following the debt restructuring. On 30 December 2015 the Group resolved to exercise its option to call for early redemption of
USD 600 million of notes that were due 1 March 2019. These notes will be repaid on 24 March 2016.
As a result of attractive financing conditions on capital markets the Group decided in September 2015 to restructure part of its debt.
The debt restructuring includes the redemption of USD 543 million of notes originally due 1 March 2019, the redemption of USD 337 million
notes originally due 1 March 2039, the redemption of USD 25 million of notes originally due 15 July 2035 and the redemption of
EUR 433 million of notes originally due 4 March 2021. These were mostly refinanced by issuing USD 1.0 billion of notes due on
10 November 2025. This major debt restructuring resulted in a loss of CHF 381 million.
All the above transactions are further described in Note 20 to the Annual Financial Statements.

The Group plans to meet its debt obligations using existing liquid funds as well as cash generated from business operations. In 2015
the free cash flow was CHF 3.4 billion, which included the cash generated from operations, as well as payment of interest, tax and
dividends. For short-term financing requirements, the Group has a commercial paper program in the US under which it can issue up
to USD 7.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper notes and committed credit lines of USD 7.5 billion available as back-stop lines.
Commercial paper notes totalling USD 2.5 billion were outstanding as of 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014: USD 3.4 billion).
For longer-term financing the Group maintains strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA by Standard & Poor’s and A1
by Moody’s which should facilitate efficient access to international capital markets.
Further information on the Group’s debt is given in Note 20 to the Annual Financial Statements.

Financial risks
At 31 December 2015 the Group has a net debt position of CHF 14.1 billion (2014: CHF 14.0 billion). The financial assets of the Group
are managed in a conservative way with the objective to meet the Group’s financial obligations at all times.
Asset allocation. A considerable portion of the cash and marketable securities the Group currently holds is being used for debt
redemptions. Liquid funds are either held as cash or are invested in high-quality, investment-grade fixed income securities with an
investment horizon to meet those liquidity requirements.

Credit risk. Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations causing financial
losses for the Group. The rating profile of the Group’s CHF 9.1 billion of cash and fixed income marketable securities remained strong
with 95% being invested in the A-AAA range. The Group has signed netting and collateral agreements with the counterparties in order
to mitigate counterparty risk on derivative positions.
The Group has trade receivables of CHF 9.0 billion. Since the beginning of 2010 there have been financial difficulties in Southern European
countries, notably Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. The Group is a leading supplier to the healthcare sectors in these countries and at
31 December 2015 has trade receivables of EUR 0.7 billion (CHF 0.7 billion) with public customers in these countries. This is a decrease of
9% compared to 31 December 2014 in EUR terms. The Group uses different measures to improve collections in these countries, including
intense communication with customers, forfaiting, negotiations of payment plans, charging of interest for late payments, and legal actions.
Strict commercial policies are in place with selected hospitals in Greece and Italy; accounts with hospitals in Spain and Portugal are closely
monitored. Since 2011 the Group’s trade receivables balance in Southern Europe has decreased by 55% in EUR terms.
As at 31 December 2015 the Group has trade receivables in Greece of EUR 163 million (CHF 176 million). During 2015 the economic
situation in Greece was volatile which has increased the credit risk for these trade receivables. The Group is closely monitoring the
situation and has taken appropriate steps to manage its exposure.
34 | Roche Finance Report 2015Financial Review | Roche Group
Liquidity risk. Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time.
The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements at any
point in time. In addition to the current liquidity position, the Group has strong cash generation ability. Those future cash flows will be
used to repay debt instruments in the coming years.
Roche enjoys strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA by Standard & Poor’s and A1 by Moody’s. At the same time Roche
is rated at the highest available short-term ratings by those agencies. In the event of financing requirements, the ratings and the strong
credit of Roche should permit efficient access to international capital markets, including the commercial paper market. The Group has
committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling CHF 7.7 billion of which CHF 7.4 billion serve as back-stop line for the
commercial paper program. As at 31 December 2015 no debt has been drawn under these credit lines.
Market risk. Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities. The exposures are
predominantly related to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to assess
the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. VaR data indicates the value range within which a given financial instrument will
fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices. The Group’s VaR remained stable in 2015.
Interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could affect the Group financial result or the value of
the Group equity. The Group may use interest rate derivatives to manage its interest-rate-related exposure and financial result.
Further information on financial risk management and financial risks and the VaR methodology is included in Note 29 to the Annual
Financial Statements.
International Financial Reporting Standards
The Roche Group has been using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to report its consolidated results since 1990.
In 2015 the Group has implemented various minor amendments to existing standards and interpretations, which have no material impact
on the Group’s overall results and financial position.
The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of the various new and revised standards and interpretations that will be
mandatory from 1 January 2016 which the Group has not yet applied. Based on the analysis to date, the Group does not anticipate that
these will have a material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position. The Group is also assessing other new and revised
standards which are not mandatory until after 2016, notably IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, IFRS 15 ‘Revenues from Contracts with
Customers’ and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’.

Notes to the Roche Group
Consolidated Financial Statements
1. General accounting principles
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements (hereafter ‘the Annual Financial Statements’) of the Roche Group have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. They have been prepared using the
historical cost convention except for items that are required to be accounted for at fair value. They were approved for issue by the Board
of Directors on 26 January 2016 and are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on 1 March 2016.
These financial statements are the Annual Financial Statements of Roche Holding Ltd, a company registered in Switzerland,
and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’).
The Group’s significant accounting policies and changes in accounting policies are disclosed in Note 32.
Key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Annual Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingent amounts. Actual outcomes could differ from those
management estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical
experience and various other factors. Revisions to estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. The following
are considered to be the key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions made and are believed to be appropriate based upon
currently available information.
Revenue. The nature of the Group’s business is such that many sales transactions do not have a simple structure and may consist
of multiple components occurring at different times. The Group is also party to out-licensing agreements which involve upfront and
milestone payments occurring over several years and which may also involve certain future obligations. Revenue is only recognised
when, in management’s judgement, the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred and when the Group does not
retain continuing managerial involvement or effective control over the goods sold or when the obligation has been fulfilled. For some
transactions this can result in cash receipts being initially recognised as deferred income and then released to income over subsequent
periods on the basis of the performance of the conditions specified in the agreement. There may be circumstances such that the level of
sales returns, and hence revenues, cannot be reliably measured. In such cases sales are only recognised when the right of return expires,
which is generally upon prescription of the products to patients. In order to estimate this, management uses publicly available information
about prescriptions as well as information provided by wholesalers and other intermediaries.
At 31 December 2015 the Group had CHF 2,316 million in provisions and accruals for expected sales returns, charge-backs and other
rebates, including Medicaid in the US and similar rebates in other countries. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual
or legislatively mandated obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience. At 31 December 2015 the Group had CHF 567 million
in provisions for doubtful receivables (see Note 11). Such estimates are based on analyses of ageing of customer balances, specific credit
circumstances, historical trends and the Group’s experience, taking also into account current economic conditions.
Business combinations. The Group initially recognises the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non-
controlling interest and the consideration transferred in a business combination. Management judgement is particularly involved in the
recognition and fair value measurement of intellectual property, inventories, contingent liabilities and contingent consideration. In making
this assessment, management considers the underlying economic substance of the items concerned in addition to the contractual terms.
42 | Roche Finance Report 2015Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Impairment. At 31 December 2015 the Group had CHF 18,473 million in property, plant and equipment (see Note 7), CHF 11,082 million
in goodwill (see Note 8) and CHF 13,861 million in intangible assets (see Note 9). Goodwill and intangible assets not yet available for
use are reviewed annually for impairment. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in use are assessed for impairment when
there is a triggering event that provides evidence that an asset may be impaired. To assess whether any impairment exists estimates of
expected future cash flows are used. Actual outcomes could vary significantly from such estimates. Factors such as changes in discount
rates, the planned use of buildings, machinery or equipment or closure of facilities, the presence of competition, technical obsolescence
and lower than anticipated product sales could lead to shorter useful lives or impairment.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits. The Group operates a number of defined benefit plans and the fair values of the
recognised plan assets and liabilities are based upon statistical and actuarial calculations. The measurement of the net defined benefit
obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate, inflation rate, expected mortality and medical cost trend rate
assumptions. At 31 December 2015 the present value of the Group’s defined benefit obligation is CHF 20,173 million (see Note 25).
The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changes in market and economic conditions, longer
or shorter life spans of participants, and other changes in the factors being assessed. These differences could impact on the defined
benefit plan assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Legal provisions. The Group provides for anticipated legal settlement costs when there is a probable outflow of resources that can
be reliably estimated. At 31 December 2015 the Group had CHF 700 million in legal provisions. The status of significant legal cases is
disclosed in Note 19. These estimates consider the specific circumstances of each legal case, relevant legal advice and are inherently
judgemental due to the highly complex nature of legal cases. The estimates could change substantially over time as new facts emerge
and each legal case progresses. Where no reliable estimate can be made, no provision is recorded and contingent liabilities are disclosed
where material.
Environmental provisions. The Group provides for anticipated environmental remediation costs when there is a probable outflow
of resources that can be reasonably estimated. At 31 December 2015 the Group had CHF 585 million in environmental provisions
(see Note 19). Environmental provisions consist primarily of costs to fully clean and refurbish contaminated sites, including landfills, and
to treat and contain contamination at certain other sites. These estimates are inherently judgemental due to uncertainties related to
the detection of previously unknown contamination, the method and extent of remediation, the percentage of the problematic materials
attributable to the Group at the remediation sites, and the financial capabilities of other potentially responsible parties. The estimates
could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each environmental remediation progresses.
Contingent consideration provisions. The Group makes provision for the estimated fair value of contingent consideration arrangements
arising from business combinations. At 31 December 2015 the Group had CHF 1,492 million in contingent consideration provisions
(see Note 19) and the total potential payments under contingent consideration arrangements could be up to CHF 2,908 million (see Note 29).
The estimated amounts provided are the expected payments, determined by considering the possible scenarios of forecast sales and
other performance criteria, the amount to be paid under each scenario, and the probability of each scenario, which is then discounted
to a net present value. The estimates could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each scenario develops.
Income taxes. At 31 December 2015 the Group had a current income tax net liability of CHF 2,542 million and a deferred tax net asset of
CHF 2,019 million (see Note 4). Significant estimates are required to determine the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Some
of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Factors that may impact on current and deferred taxes
include changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, future levels of research
and development spending and changes in pre-tax earnings.
Leases. The treatment of leasing transactions is mainly determined by whether the lease is considered to be an operating or finance
lease. In making this assessment, management looks at the substance of the lease, as well as the legal form, and makes a judgement
about whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Arrangements which do not take the legal form
of a lease but that nevertheless convey the right to use an asset are also covered by such assessments.
Consolidation. The Group periodically undertakes transactions that may involve obtaining control or significant influence of other
companies. These transactions include equity acquisitions, asset purchases, alliance agreements and other transactions with structured
entities. In all such cases management makes an assessment as to whether the Group has control or significant influence of the other
company, and whether it should be consolidated as a subsidiary or accounted for as an associated company. In making this assessment,
management considers the underlying economic substance of the transaction in addition to the contractual terms.

2. Operating segment information
The Group has two Divisions, Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. Revenues are primarily generated from the sale of prescription
pharmaceutical products and diagnostic instruments, reagents and consumables respectively. Both Divisions also derive revenues from
the sale or licensing of products or technology to third parties. Residual operating activities from divested businesses and certain global
activities are reported as ‘Corporate’. These include the Corporate Executive Committee and global group functions for communications,
human resources, finance (including treasury, taxes and pension fund management), legal, safety and environmental services. Sub-
divisional information for Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai, operating segments within the Pharmaceuticals Division, is also presented.

Since the Group operates internationally, it is subject to income taxes in many different tax jurisdictions. The Group calculates its average
expected tax rate as a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates. This rate changes from year
to year due to changes in the mix of the Group’s taxable income and changes in local tax rates.
The Group’s average expected tax rate increased to 24.9% in 2015 (2014: 20.5%). The main driver for the increase was the higher
proportion of the Group’s profits from the US, which has a relatively higher local tax rate than the average Group rate. The proportion
of US profits in 2014 was lowered by goodwill impairments. There were no significant local tax rate changes in the main operating areas
of the Group compared to 2014.
The Group’s effective tax rate increased to 24.5% in 2015 (2014: 23.8%). The main driver for the increase was the higher average
expected tax rate disclosed above. This was partially offset by the tax benefit from the intra-group transfer of intangible rights in 2015
and the 2014 goodwill impairments that were not tax deductible.
The Group’s effective tax rate can be reconciled to the Group’s average expected tax rate as follows:
Reconciliation of the Group’s effective tax rate

– US state tax impacts +0.6% +0.5%
– Tax on unremitted earnings +1.9% +1.2%
– Utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses –0.6% –
– Deferred tax on intra-group transfers –2.0% –
– Other differences – –0.1%
Group’s effective tax rate 24.5% 23.8%
The income tax benefit recorded in respect of equity compensation plans, which varies according to the price of the underlying equity,
was CHF 81 million (2014: CHF 64 million). Had the income tax benefits been recorded solely on the basis of the IFRS 2 expense
multiplied by the applicable tax rate, then a benefit of approximately CHF 111 million (2014: CHF 96 million) would have been recorded.

As disclosed in Note 5, the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) at 31 December 2014 have been restated following the finalisation of the valuation of the net assets acquired related to
the InterMune, Dutalys and Bina acquisitions in 2014. A reconciliation to the previously published balance sheet is provided in Note 5.
The deferred tax net assets for other temporary differences mainly relate to accrued and other liabilities, provisions and unrealised profit
in inventory.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward only to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit is probable.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses, including valuation allowances, as follows:
Unrecognised tax losses: expiry
2015 2014
Amount Applicable Amount Applicable
(CHF m) tax rate (CHF m) tax rate
Within one year 95 14% – –

More than five years 7,782 5% 6,349 5%
Total unrecognised tax losses 8,761 6% 6,937 6%
The ‘More than five years’ category includes losses that cannot be used for US state income tax purposes in those states which only
permit tax reporting on a separate entity basis.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been established for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the remittance of
earnings of foreign subsidiaries, where such amounts are currently regarded as permanently reinvested. The total unremitted earnings of
the Group, regarded as permanently reinvested, were CHF 25.7 billion at 31 December 2015 (2014: CHF 29.3 billion).

Trophos. On 3 March 2015 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Trophos, a privately owned company based in Marseille,
France. Trophos’ proprietary screening platform generated olesoxime (TRO19622), which is being developed for spinal muscular atrophy
(SMA), a rare and debilitating genetic neuromuscular disease that is most commonly diagnosed in children. Trophos is reported in the
Pharmaceuticals Division. The total consideration was EUR 345 million, of which EUR 120 million was paid in cash and EUR 225 million
arose from a contingent consideration arrangement. The contingent payments are based on the achievement of performance-related
milestones and the range of undiscounted outcomes is between zero and EUR 350 million.
Foundation Medicine, Inc. On 7 April 2015 the Group acquired a 61.3% controlling interest in Foundation Medicine, Inc. (‘FMI’),
a publicly owned US company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. FMI is listed on Nasdaq under the stock code ‘FMI’. The transaction
further advances FMI’s market-leading position in molecular information and genomic analysis while providing the Group with a unique
opportunity to optimise the identification and development of novel treatment options for cancer patients. The transaction included both
a broad research and development collaboration agreement and a commercial collaboration agreement aimed at expanding the global
sales efforts for FMI’s current and future products. FMI is reported in the Pharmaceuticals Division. The total cash consideration was
USD 1.0 billion.

The fair value of the intangible assets is determined using an excess earning method that is based on management forecasts and
observable market data for discount rates, tax rates and foreign exchange rates. The present value is calculated using a risk-adjusted
discount rate of 10.0% for Trophos and 9.5% for FMI. The valuations were performed by independent valuers.
The FMI accounts receivable is comprised of gross contractual amounts due of CHF 10 million which are all expected to be collectable
at the date of acquisition.
For Trophos the goodwill represents a control premium, the acquired work force and the synergies that can be expected from integrating
the acquired company into the Group’s existing business. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
For FMI the goodwill represents the strategic value to Roche Pharmaceuticals of accessing FMI’s molecular information and genomic
analysis. It also represents the premium paid over the traded market price to obtain control of the business, the acquired workforce and
expected synergies. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The non-controlling interests in FMI
were measured at the date of acquisition at their proportionate share (38.7%) of FMI’s identifiable net assets.
The Group recognised a financial gain of CHF 16 million from fair valuing the 1.2% equity interest in FMI held by the Group prior to
the transaction. This gain is included in other financial income (expense) for 2015.
Directly attributable transaction costs of CHF 9 million are reported in the Pharmaceuticals operating segment within general and
administration expenses and mainly relate to the FMI acquisition.
The impact of the Trophos and FMI acquisitions on the 2015 results for the Pharmaceuticals Division and the Group were not material.

The fair value of the intangible assets is determined using an excess earning method that is based on management forecasts and
observable market data for discount rates, tax rates and foreign exchange rates. The present value is calculated using a risk-adjusted
discount rate of 10.0% for Ariosa, 17.1% for CAPP, 9.5% for GeneWeave and 11.7% for Kapa. The valuations for Ariosa, CAPP,
GeneWeave and Kapa were performed by independent valuers.
The Ariosa and Kapa accounts receivable is comprised of gross contractual amounts due of CHF 12 million and CHF 8 million respectively,
which are all expected to be collectable at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill represents a control premium, the acquired work force and the synergies that can be expected from integrating the acquired
companies into the Group’s existing business. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

As disclosed below, the net assets acquired have been restated following the finalisation of the valuation of the InterMune and Dutalys acquisitions.
The fair value of the intangible assets is determined using an excess earning method that is based on management forecasts and
observable market data for discount rates, tax rates and foreign exchange rates. The present value is calculated using a risk-adjusted
discount rate of 9.5% for Seragon, 8.9% to 9.4% for Santaris, 9.0% to 9.5% for InterMune and 9.5% for Dutalys. The valuations were
performed by independent valuers.
The fair value of InterMune inventories is determined based on the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less
the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort to complete and sell the inventories.
The InterMune accounts receivable is comprised of gross contractual amounts due of CHF 35 million.
Goodwill represents a control premium, the acquired work force and the synergies that can be expected from integrating the acquired
companies into the Group’s existing business. For InterMune the control premium represents the premium paid over the traded market
price to obtain control of the business. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Directly attributable transaction costs of CHF 15 million were reported in the Pharmaceuticals operating segment within general and
administration expenses and mainly related to the InterMune acquisition.
In the three months to 31 December 2014 InterMune contributed revenue of CHF 44 million and a net loss of CHF 292 million to
the results reported for the Pharmaceuticals Division and the Group. The impact of the Seragon, Santaris and Dutalys acquisitions on
the 2014 results were not material.

6. Global restructuring plans
During 2015 the Group continued with the implementation of several major global restructuring plans initiated in prior years, notably
the programme in the Diagnostics Division’s Diabetes Care business. On 12 November 2015 the Pharmaceuticals Division announced
a strategic realignment of its manufacturing network, including exiting from four sites. Total costs in 2015 of CHF 1.2 billion were
considerably higher than the 2014 costs of CHF 0.8 billion. This is due to the strategic realignment of the Pharmaceuticals Division’s
manufacturing network with costs of CHF 0.6 billion.

Diagnostics Division
On 26 September 2013 Roche Diabetes Care announced the ‘Autonomy and Speed’ initiative which will enable the business to focus
on Diabetes Care specific requirements, speed up processes and decision-making and drive efficiencies. In 2015 total costs of
CHF 175 million were incurred, mainly for consultancy and IT-related costs as well as employee-related costs. Spending on other smaller
plans within the Division was CHF 126 million and included costs related to certain IT projects and the restructuring of the former Applied
Science business.

Site consolidation
On 12 November 2015 the Pharmaceuticals Division announced a strategic realignment of its manufacturing network including exiting
from the manufacturing sites at Clarecastle, Ireland; Leganés, Spain; Segrate, Italy; and Florence, US. Costs for this plan are expected to
be in the order of CHF 1.6 billion, of which up to CHF 0.6 billion will be in cash. The plan is expected to run until 2021 and approximately
1,200 positions will be affected. Costs from this plan in 2015 were CHF 602 million, of which CHF 182 million were non-cash write-downs
and accelerated depreciation of property, plant and equipment. Additional costs were recorded in the Pharmaceuticals Division for the
outsourcing of logistics at the Rosny site in France and the closure of the manufacturing site at Toluca, Mexico. The divestment plans for
the Nutley site are on track.
Other global restructuring plans
In 2015 total costs were CHF 180 million, with the major items being CHF 62 million from the Pharmaceuticals Division research and
development strategic realignment and CHF 55 million from various initiatives to reduce the field force in the Europe and Asia-Pacific
regions. As part of this realignment on 23 April 2015 the Group sold its wholly owned subsidiary Marcadia Biotech, Inc. to a third party
with a loss on disposal of CHF 23 million (see Note 22). The remaining minor plans totalled CHF 63 million.
In 2014 total costs were CHF 436 million, with a major item being a goodwill impairment of CHF 139 million related to the Marcadia
Biotech, Inc. acquisition in 2010. Other significant costs included CHF 121 million relating to European field force reductions in
the Pharmaceuticals Division’s Specialty Care unit, InterMune integration costs of CHF 79 million, costs of CHF 46 million from the
implementation of the global outsourcing of clinical trial monitoring in the Pharmaceuticals Division and the remaining minor plans totalled
CHF 51 million.

Genentech property purchase option exercise
In 2004 Genentech entered into a Master Lease Agreement (‘MLA’) with Slough SSF LLC (‘Slough’), which was subsequently acquired
by Health Care Properties, for the lease of property adjacent to Genentech’s South San Francisco site, which was to be developed by
Slough. The development included a total of eight buildings and construction was completed during 2008, at which time Genentech fully
occupied the property. The property lease was until 2020 with extension options to 2030. On 1 November 2015 Genentech exercised
a purchase option contained in the MLA to acquire the eight buildings and land. The closing payments will be made in November 2016
and July 2018 for a total of USD 580 million. At 31 December 2015 the Group has recorded an addition to ‘land’ and ‘buildings and
land improvements’ and corresponding short-term and long-term liabilities for the cash outflows in 2016 and 2018. The Group has also
reclassified the finance lease accounting balances that previously applied to these buildings.

Impairment charge – 2015
There were no impairments of goodwill during 2015.
Impairment charge – 2014
During 2014 impairment charges totalling CHF 874 million were recorded which related to:
• A goodwill impairment charge of CHF 552 million was recorded for the full write-off of the goodwill in the Tissue Diagnostics business
area within the Diagnostics Division. The factors leading to this impairment were: (i) A decrease in forecasted cash flows following
a reassessment of a late-stage future product development which was returned to a pre-design phase, combined with additional
US reductions in immunohistochemistry testing reimbursement to laboratories and the business plan projection period being reduced
from ten years to five years; and (ii) An increase in the pre-tax discount rate used for impairment testing. In addition impairments of
CHF 643 million were recorded for product intangibles in the Tissue Diagnostics business (see Note 9).
• A goodwill impairment charge of CHF 322 million was recorded in the Pharmaceuticals Division for the full write-off of goodwill from
the Marcadia Biotech, Inc. acquisition in 2010, the Memory acquisition in 2009 and the ARIUS and Piramed acquisitions in 2008 which
are all deemed to have been disposed of.
64 | Roche Finance Report 2015Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Impairment testing
Pharmaceuticals Division. The Division’s operating segments are the cash-generating units used for the testing of goodwill. Part of
the goodwill arising from the Foundation Medicine acquisition is recorded and monitored at a Roche Pharmaceuticals level as it
relates to the strategic development of Roche Pharmaceuticals. Therefore the cash-generating unit for this strategic goodwill is Roche
Pharmaceuticals.
The recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. For assessing
value in use, the cash flow projections are based on the most recent business plans approved by management. The business plans
include management’s latest estimates on sales volume and pricing, as well as production and other operating costs and assume no
significant changes in the organisation. For Chugai and Foundation Medicine the fair value less costs of disposal is determined with
reference to the publicly quoted share prices of Chugai and Foundation Medicine shares.
The business plans are projected over five years. These valuations include a terminal value beyond these years, assuming no further
growth. The discount rate used is based on an after-tax rate of 7.0% (2014: 7.7%), which is derived from a capital asset pricing model
using data from capital markets, including government twenty-year bonds. A weighted average tax rate of 28.0% (2014: 25.6%) is used
in the calculations and the corresponding pre-tax discount rate is 9.8% (2014: 10.4%).
Diagnostics Division. The Division’s business areas are the cash-generating units used for the testing of goodwill. The goodwill arising
from the Corange/Boehringer Mannheim acquisition and part of the goodwill from the Ventana acquisition is recorded and monitored
at a Divisional level as it relates to the strategic development of the whole Division and cannot be meaningfully allocated to the Division’s
business areas. Therefore the cash-generating unit for this goodwill is the entire Division.
The recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is based on value in use and the cash flow projections are based on the most
recent business plans approved by management. The business plans include management’s latest estimates on sales volume and pricing,
as well as production and other operating costs and assume no significant changes in the organisation.
The business plans are projected over five years, except for the sequencing business which is projected over ten years reflecting
the long-term nature of this business. These valuations include a terminal value beyond these years, assuming no further growth.
The discount rate used is based on an after-tax rate of 7.0% (2014: 7.7%), which is derived from a capital asset pricing model using
data from capital markets, including government twenty-year bonds. A weighted average tax rate of 17.1% (2014: 18.4%) is used in
the calculations and the corresponding pre-tax discount rate is 8.5% (2014: 9.5%).
Sensitivity analysis
Management has performed sensitivity analyses for Roche Pharmaceuticals and the Diagnostics Division, which increased the discount
rate by 1% combined with decreasing the forecast cash flows by 5%, and for Chugai and Foundation Medicine, which decreased
the publicly quoted share prices by 5%. Except for Molecular Diagnostics, the results of the sensitivity analyses demonstrated that
the above changes in the key assumptions would not cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount at
31 December 2015. The above key assumption changes would result in a goodwill impairment of CHF 245 million for Molecular
Diagnostics at 31 December 2015.

Internally generated intangible assets
The Group currently has no internally generated intangible assets from development as the criteria for the recognition as an asset are
not met.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
The Group currently has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Intangible assets not available for use
These mostly represent in-process research and development assets acquired either through in-licensing arrangements, business
combinations or separate purchases. At 31 December 2015 approximately 89% (2014: 29%) of the projects in the Pharmaceuticals
Division have known decision points within the next twelve months which in certain circumstances could lead to impairment.
Due to the inherent uncertainties in the research and development processes, intangible assets not available for use are particularly
at risk of impairment if the project is not expected to result in a commercialised product.
Roche Finance Report 2015 | 67Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Intangible asset impairment
Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
eventual disposal. Factors such as the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence or lower than anticipated sales for
products with capitalised rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
Impairment charges – 2015
Pharmaceuticals Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 69 million were recorded which related to:
• Decisions to stop development of four compounds with different alliance partners (CHF 64 million). The assets concerned, which were
not yet being amortised, were fully written down.
• A decision to stop one collaboration project with an alliance partner (CHF 5 million). The asset concerned, which was being amortised,
was fully written down.
Impairment charges – 2014
Pharmaceuticals Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 337 million were recorded which related to:
• A clinical data assessment of one development project (CHF 102 million). The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised,
was fully written down.
• A decision to stop development of a compound acquired as part of a previous business combination (CHF 88 million). The asset
concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A decision to stop development of a compound with an alliance partner (CHF 78 million). The asset concerned, which was not yet being
amortised, was fully written down.
• A reassessment of two projects within the hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise (CHF 37 million) mainly due to the negative outcome of
an arbitration against a competitor. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully written down.
• A decision to stop development of one compound (CHF 24 million). The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully
written down.
• A decision to stop one collaboration project with an alliance partner (CHF 8 million). The asset concerned, which was not yet being
amortised, was fully written down.
Diagnostics Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 697 million were recorded which related to:
• Tissue Diagnostics product intangibles not available for use (CHF 472 million). The factors leading to this impairment were a
reassessment of a late-stage future product development which was returned to a pre-design phase to demonstrate feasibility and
quality improvement. The asset concerned, which was not yet in use, was fully written down.
• Tissue Diagnostics product intangibles in use (CHF 171 million). The factors leading to this impairment were a decrease in forecasted
cash flows following the US reductions in immunohistochemistry testing reimbursement to laboratories and an increase in the asset-
specific pre-tax discount rate used for impairment testing. The assets concerned, which were being amortised, were written down to
their estimated recoverable value of CHF 122 million.
• Diabetes Care technology intangibles in use (CHF 54 million). The factors leading to this impairment were a decrease in forecasted
cash flows following a change in the timelines for future product development and an increase in the asset-specific pre-tax discount
rate used for impairment testing. The assets concerned, which were being amortised, were written down to their estimated recoverable
value of CHF 39 million.
Potential commitments from alliance collaborations and purchase agreements
The Group is party to in-licensing and similar arrangements with its alliance partners and intangible asset purchase agreements from
third-parties. These arrangements and purchase agreements may require the Group to make certain milestone or other similar payments
dependent upon the achievement of agreed objectives or performance targets as defined in the collaboration and purchase agreements.
The Group’s current estimate of future third-party commitments for such payments is set out in the table below. These figures are
undiscounted and are not risk-adjusted, meaning that they include all such potential payments that can arise assuming all projects
currently in development are successful. The timing is based on the Group’s current best estimate. These figures do not include any
potential commitments within the Group, such as may arise between the Roche and Chugai businesses.

Legal provisions
Legal provisions consist of a number of separate legal matters, including claims arising from trade, in various Group companies.
By their nature the amounts and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict.
In 2015 legal expenses totalled CHF 41 million (2014: CHF 203 million) which reflect the recent developments in various legal matters.
Details of the major legal cases outstanding are disclosed below.
Roche Finance Report 2015 | 73Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Environmental provisions
Provisions for environmental matters include various separate environmental issues in a number of countries. By their nature the amounts
and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict. Significant provisions are discounted by between 2% and 4% where the time value of
money is material. The significant provisions relate to the US site in Nutley, New Jersey, the estimated remediation costs for a landfill site
near Grenzach, Germany that was used by manufacturing operations that were closed some years ago and the estimated remediation
costs for the manufacturing site at Clarecastle, Ireland (see Note 6).
Restructuring provisions
These arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of business undertaken by the Group or the manner in which
business is conducted. Such provisions include only the costs necessarily entailed by the restructuring which are not associated with
the recurring activities of the Group. The timings of these cash outflows are reasonably certain. These provisions are not discounted
as the time value of money is not material in these matters.
In the Pharmaceuticals Division the significant provisions relate to the strategic realignment of the manufacturing network including
exiting from four manufacturing sites (see Note 6), the research and development strategic realignment and field force reduction in
the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.
Employee provisions
These mostly relate to certain employee benefit obligations, such as sabbatical leave and long-service benefits. The timings of these cash
outflows can be reasonably estimated based on past experience.
Other provisions
The timing of cash outflows are by their nature uncertain and other provisions relate to the items shown in the table below.

Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees, to be affected by political, legislative, fiscal
and regulatory developments, including those relating to environmental protection, in the countries in which it operates. The industries
in which the Group operates are also subject to other risks of various kinds. The nature and frequency of these developments and events,
not all of which are covered by insurance, as well as their effect on future operations and earnings, are not predictable.
The Group has entered into strategic alliances with various companies in order to gain access to potential new products or to utilise other
companies to help develop the Group’s own potential new products. Potential future payments may become due to certain collaboration
partners achieving certain milestones as defined in the collaboration agreements. The Group’s best estimates of future commitments for
such payments are given in Note 9.

Pharmaceuticals legal cases
Accutane. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (‘HLR’) and various other Roche affiliates have been named as defendants in numerous legal
actions in the US and elsewhere relating to the acne medication Accutane. The litigation alleges that Accutane caused certain serious
conditions, including, but not limited to, inflammatory bowel disease (‘IBD’), birth defects and psychiatric disorders. In 2009 HLR
announced that, following a re-evaluation of its portfolio of medicines that are now available from generic manufacturers, rapidly
declining brand sales in the US and high costs from personal-injury lawsuits that it continues to defend vigorously, it had decided to
immediately discontinue the manufacture and distribution of the product in the US.
All of the actions pending in federal court alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation (‘MDL’)
in the US District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division. In August 2015 the MDL was closed. During the pendency of
the MDL the District Court granted summary judgment in favour of HLR for all of the federal IBD cases that had proceeded and all were
affirmed by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. All of the actions pending in state court in New Jersey alleging IBD were
consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County.
Since 1 January 2015 there have been approximately 2,720 cases dismissed in the US and at 31 December 2015 HLR was defending
approximately 3,900 actions involving approximately 3,990 plaintiffs brought in various federal and state courts throughout the US for
personal injuries allegedly resulting from their use of Accutane.
In February 2015 the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County, held an eight-day evidentiary hearing on whether
plaintiffs’ experts can testify that Accutane causes Crohn’s disease. On 20 February 2015 the Superior Court barred plaintiffs’ experts
because their methods did not meet the requirements for scientific reliability. On 8 May 2015 the Superior Court entered an order
dismissing with prejudice an agreed-upon list of 2,076 Crohn’s disease cases that were subject to the Superior Court’s February 2015
order. On 12 May 2015 the Superior Court entered an order granting summary judgment and dismissing 18 cases filed by New Jersey
residents on the basis that the drug label was adequate as a matter of law since 2002. In July 2015 the Superior Court granted HLR’s
motion for summary judgment as to the adequacy of the label for post-2002 ingestion cases in 44 other jurisdictions. The Superior Court
applied New Jersey law to all of the jurisdictions and granted HLR’s motion dismissing approximately 511 cases. In the alternative, the
Superior Court applied the home state law and granted summary judgment in 24 jurisdictions and denied it in 20 jurisdictions; this would
have resulted in 389 cases being dismissed. The plaintiffs have appealed the decisions related to Crohn’s disease and the drug label.
At 31 December 2015 juries in the New Jersey Superior Court have ruled in favour of the plaintiff in eight cases, assessing compensatory
damages totalling USD 59 million. For the eight cases that were ruled in favour of the plaintiff by the Superior Court, HLR is in the process
of appealing three cases (USD 20 million) and five cases have had their verdicts reversed in favour of HLR (USD 39 million), of which
one case (USD 25 million) is on appeal to the New Jersey Supreme Court.
Additional trials may be scheduled for 2016. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including many that are unique to
the particular case and therefore the trial results to date may not be predictive of future trial results. The Group continues to defend
vigorously the remaining personal injury cases and claims.
Avastin/Lucentis investigations. On 14 February 2013 the Italian Antitrust Authority (‘AGCM’) announced an investigation to determine
whether Roche, Genentech and Novartis had entered into an agreement to restrict competition in the Italian market for drugs, with
reference in particular to Avastin (marketed by Roche) and Lucentis (marketed by Novartis). Avastin and Lucentis are two different
drugs that were developed and approved for different therapeutic purposes and contain different active pharmaceutical ingredients. On
5 March 2014 the AGCM issued a verdict that alleges that Roche and Novartis colluded to artificially differentiate Avastin and Lucentis
in order to foster the sales of Lucentis in Italy. The AGCM fined Roche EUR 90.5 million and Novartis EUR 92 million. Roche appealed
the AGCM verdict to the Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale del Lazio (‘TAR’). On 2 December 2014 the TAR upheld the decision by the
AGCM. Roche strongly disagrees with the verdict of the TAR and has appealed. On 30 May 2014 the Italian Ministry of Health notified
Roche S.p.A. of its intention to seek damages related to this matter. In July 2014 Roche paid the EUR 90.5 million fine under protest to
avoid additional penalty fees and recorded an expense within general and administration. The fine and related interest will be reimbursed
if Roche wins the case. The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Tarceva subpoena. On 2 November 2011 Genentech received a subpoena from the US Department of Justice (‘DOJ’), requesting
documents and information related to the promotion of Tarceva, a prescription product initially approved for the treatment of locally
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, and later approved for
additional indications. Genentech is cooperating with the associated investigation. On 6 May 2014 government representatives presented
for the first time the government’s civil liability theory, specifically that Genentech allegedly participated in the off-label promotion of
Tarceva causing the submission of false claims for reimbursement under the Civil False Claims Act. On 14 August 2015 the government
closed its criminal investigation against Genentech. Genentech continues to have discussions with the government on its civil liability
theory. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Roche Finance Report 2015 | 75Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Rituxan arbitration. In October 2008 Genentech and Biogen Idec Inc. filed a complaint in California against Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland
GmbH, Sanofi-Aventis US LLC and Sanofi-Aventis US Inc. (‘Sanofi’) seeking a declaratory judgment that certain Genentech products,
including Rituxan, do not infringe Sanofi’s US Patent Nos. 5,849,522 and 6,218,140 and that the ’522 and ’140 patents are invalid. Sanofi
alleged that Rituxan and another Genentech product infringe certain claims of the ’522 and ’140 patents. In March 2011 the district court
ruled as a matter of law that Genentech and Biogen Idec do not infringe the asserted patent claims. In May 2011 Sanofi appealed the
court’s non-infringement ruling. The appellate court affirmed the district court’s judgment of no patent infringement.
In addition in October 2008 Sanofi affiliate Hoechst GmbH (‘Hoechst’) filed with the ICC International Court of Arbitration (Paris)
a request for arbitration with Genentech, relating to a terminated patent-licence agreement between one of Hoechst’s predecessors
and Genentech that pertained to the above-mentioned patents and related patents outside the US. Hoechst sought payment of patent-
licence royalties on sales of certain Genentech products, including Rituxan, damages for breach of contract, and other relief. In various
arbitral awards in September 2012 and February 2013, the arbitrator found Genentech liable to Hoechst for patent-licence royalties on
Rituxan, and he awarded the royalties and interest that Hoechst had sought. In February 2013 the Group recorded a back royalty expense
of CHF 42 million, net of the assumed reimbursement of a portion of the Group’s obligation by its co-promotion partner in the US.
Hoechst initiated proceedings in the US, France and Germany seeking to enforce the arbitral awards. In October 2013 Genentech paid
the awarded royalties and interest to Hoechst under protest. Genentech is seeking annulment of the arbitral awards through proceedings
it initiated in the Court of Appeal of Paris. There was a hearing in those proceedings in June 2014. In September 2014 the Paris Court
of Appeal stayed the annulment proceedings to seek guidance from the EU Court of Justice on a specific legal question that had been
raised by Genentech relating to the arbitral award’s non-compliance under EU competition laws. In November 2014 Hoechst filed notices
of appeal to the French Supreme Court seeking to review the Paris Court of Appeal’s decision to seek guidance from the EU Court of
Justice. On 18 November 2015 the French Supreme Court denied Hoechst’s challenge to the decision of the Paris Court of Appeals to
refer the specific legal question to the EU Court of Justice. The EU Court of Justice held a hearing on 20 January 2016 and a judgment
is expected later in 2016. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Average Wholesale Prices litigation. HLR and Roche Laboratories Inc. (‘RLI’), along with approximately 50 other brand and generic
pharmaceutical companies, have been named as defendants in several legal actions in the US relating to the pricing of pharmaceutical
drugs and State Medicaid reimbursement. The primary allegation in these litigations is that the pharmaceutical companies misrepresented
or otherwise reported inaccurate Average Wholesale Prices (‘AWP’) and/or Wholesale Acquisition Costs (‘WAC’) for their drugs, which
prices were allegedly relied upon by the States in calculating Medicaid reimbursements to entities such as retail pharmacies. The States,
through their respective Attorney General, are seeking repayment of the amounts they claim were over-reimbursed. The time period
associated with these cases is 1991 through 2005. At 31 December 2015 HLR and RLI are defending one AWP action filed in the state of
New Jersey. HLR and RLI are vigorously defending themselves and no trial date has been set. The outcome of this matter cannot be
determined at this time.
Boniva litigation. HLR, Genentech and various other Roche affiliates (collectively ‘Roche’) have been named as defendants in numerous
legal actions in the US and Canada relating to the post-menopausal osteoporosis medication Boniva. In these litigations, the plaintiffs
allege that Boniva caused either osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypical femoral fractures. At 31 December 2015 Roche is defending
approximately 290 actions involving approximately 340 plaintiffs brought in federal and state courts throughout the US and one action
brought in the Court of the Queen’s Bench, Province of Saskatchewan, Canada, for personal injuries allegedly resulting from the use of
Boniva. All of these cases are in the early discovery stages of litigation. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including
many that are unique to the particular case. Roche is vigorously defending itself in these matters. The outcome of these matters cannot
be determined at this time.
EMA investigation. On 23 October 2012 the European Medicines Agency (‘EMA’) announced that it would start an infringement
procedure to investigate allegations regarding an alleged breach of medicines safety reporting obligations in relation to 19 centrally
authorised medicines. On 19 November 2013 the EMA announced the results of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee
assessment of Roche’s medicines. The EMA found no impact regarding the benefit-risk balance of any of Roche’s medicines and
confirmed the benefit-risk profiles based on available safety information. The EMA and other health authorities have confirmed all
medicines remain authorised without changes to the treatment advice for patients and healthcare professionals. All corrective and
preventative actions resulting from the inspections are being implemented. A re-inspection by authorities in November 2013 led
to certain findings which Roche is now addressing. On 14 April 2014 the EMA issued its report to the European Commission that
summarises the EMA’s findings in relation to the investigation. On 6 July 2015 the European Commission issued a notification to the
EMA, returning the case file to the EMA for a new period of inquiry. The EMA has a year to adopt a revised report for submission
to the European Commission. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

to call for early partial redemption of the 6.0% fixed rate notes due 1 March 2019. The Group will redeem an outstanding principal of
USD 600 million on 24 March 2016 at an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of these
notes discounted to the redemption date at the US Treasury rate plus 0.50%, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal.
A cash outflow of approximately USD 661 million, plus accrued interest, is expected on redemption. The Group has revised the carrying
value of these notes to take into account the changes to the amounts and timings of the estimated cash flows. The revised carrying value
of these notes at 31 December 2015 is USD 669 million (CHF 661 million). The increase in carrying value of USD 74 million (CHF 72 million)
is recorded within financing costs (see Note 3) as a loss on redemption. The effective interest rate of these notes is 6.37%.
Redemption and repurchase of bonds and notes – 2014
During 2014 the Group completed the early repurchase of GBP 419 million of fixed rate notes and completed the early redemption of
USD 2.5 billion of fixed rate notes.

Genentech transaction
The Group completed the purchase of the non-controlling interests in Genentech effective 26 March 2009. Based on the International
Accounting Standard 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ (IAS 27) and consistent with the International Financial Reporting Standard 10
‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ (IFRS 10), which was adopted by the Group in 2013, this transaction was accounted for in full as an
equity transaction. As a consequence, the carrying amount of the consolidated equity of the Group at that time was reduced by
CHF 52.2 billion, of which CHF 8.5 billion was allocated to eliminate the book value of Genentech non-controlling interests. This
accounting effect significantly impacted the Group’s net equity, but has no effect on the Group’s business or its dividend policy.
Roche Finance Report 2015 | 83Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Share capital
At 31 December 2015 the authorised and issued share capital of Roche Holding Ltd, which is the Group’s parent company, consisted
of 160 million shares with a nominal value of CHF 1.00 each, as in the preceding year. The shares are bearer shares and the Group does
not maintain a register of shareholders. Based on information supplied to the Group, a shareholder group with pooled voting rights owns
45.01% (2014: 45.01%) of the issued shares. On 24 March 2011 the shareholder group announced that it would continue the shareholder
pooling agreement existing since 1948 with a modified shareholder composition. The shareholder group with pooled voting rights now
holds 72,018,000 shares, corresponding to 45.01% of the shares issued. This figure does not include any shares without pooled voting
rights that are held outside this group by individual members of the group. Ms Maja Oeri, formerly a member of the pool, now holds
8,091,900 shares representing 5.057% of the voting rights independently of the pool. This is further described in Note 30. Based on
information supplied to the Group, Novartis Ltd, Basel, and its affiliates own 33.333% (participation below 331⁄3%) of the issued shares
(2014: 33.333%).
Non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
At 31 December 2015, 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities have been authorised and were in issue as in the preceding year.
Under Swiss company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value, are not part of the share capital and cannot be
issued against a contribution which would be shown as an asset in the balance sheet of Roche Holding Ltd. Each non-voting equity
security confers the same rights as any of the shares to participate in the net profit and any remaining proceeds from liquidation
following repayment of the nominal value of the shares and, if any, participation certificates. In accordance with the law and the Articles
of Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd, the Company is entitled at all times to exchange all or some of the non-voting equity securities
into shares or participation certificates.
Dividends
On 3 March 2015 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of CHF 8.00 per share and non-voting equity security
(2014: CHF 7.80) in respect of the 2014 business year. The distribution to holders of outstanding shares and non-voting equity securities
totalled CHF 6,807 million (2014: CHF 6,617 million) and has been recorded against retained earnings in 2015. The Board of Directors
has proposed dividends for the 2015 business year of CHF 8.10 per share and non-voting equity security which, if approved, would result
in a total distribution to shareholders of CHF 6,987 million. This is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 1 March 2016.

22. Subsidiaries
Chugai
Effective 1 October 2002 the Roche Group and Chugai completed an alliance to create a leading research-driven Japanese
pharmaceutical company, which was formed by the merger of Chugai and Roche’s Japanese pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Nippon Roche.
The merged company is known as Chugai.
Consolidated subsidiary. Chugai is a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group. This is based on the Group’s interest in Chugai at
31 December 2015 of 61.39% (2014: 61.46%) and the Roche relationship with Chugai that is founded on the Basic Alliance, Licensing and
Research Collaboration Agreements.
The common stock of Chugai is publicly traded and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the stock code ‘TSE:4519’. Chugai
prepares financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) which are filed on a quarterly basis
with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to certain consolidation entries there are minor differences between Chugai’s stand-alone IFRS
results and the results of Chugai as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS.

Dividends. The dividends distributed to third parties holding Chugai shares during 2015 totalled CHF 87 million (2014: CHF 81 million)
and have been recorded against non-controlling interests (see Note 23). Dividends paid by Chugai to Roche are eliminated on
consolidation as inter-company items.
Roche’s relationship with Chugai. Chugai has entered into certain agreements with Roche, which are discussed below:
(1) Basic Alliance Agreement – As part of the Basic Alliance Agreement signed in December 2001, Roche and Chugai entered into
certain arrangements covering the future operation and governance of Chugai. Amongst other matters these cover the following areas:
• The structuring of the alliance.
• Roche’s rights as a shareholder.
• Roche’s rights to nominate members of Chugai’s Board of Directors.
• Certain limitations to Roche’s ability to buy or sell Chugai’s common stock.
Chugai issues additional shares of common stock in connection with its convertible debt and equity compensation plans, and may issue
additional shares for other purposes, which affects Roche’s percentage ownership interest. The Basic Alliance Agreement provides,
amongst other matters, that Chugai will guarantee Roche’s right to maintain its shareholding percentage in Chugai at not less than 50.1%.
Roche Finance Report 2015 | 85Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
(2) Licensing Agreements – Under the Japan Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in December 2001, Chugai has exclusive rights to
market Roche’s pharmaceutical products in Japan. Chugai also has the right of first refusal on the development and marketing in Japan of
all development compounds advanced by Roche.
The Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement (excluding Japan and South Korea) signed in May 2002 was revised and the Amended
and Restated Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement (excluding Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) was signed in August 2014.
Under this Agreement Roche has the right of first refusal on the development and marketing of Chugai’s development compounds in
markets outside Japan, excluding South Korea and Taiwan.
Further to these agreements, Roche and Chugai have signed a series of separate agreements for certain specific products. Depending
on the specific circumstances and the terms of the agreement, this may result in payments on an arm’s length basis between Roche and
Chugai, for any or all of the following matters:
• Upfront payments, if a right of first refusal to licence a product is exercised.
• Milestone payments, dependent upon the achievement of agreed performance targets.
• Royalties on future product sales.
These specific product agreements may also cover the manufacture and supply of the respective products to meet the other party’s
clinical and/or commercial requirements on an arm’s length basis.
(3) Research Collaboration Agreements – Roche and Chugai have entered into research collaboration agreements in the areas of small-
molecule synthetic drug research and biotechnology-based drug discovery.
Foundation Medicine
On 7 April 2015 the Group acquired a controlling interest in Foundation Medicine, Inc. (‘FMI’) and entered into an Investor Rights
Agreement, a Research and Development Collaboration Agreement and several Commercial Collaboration Agreements.
Consolidated subsidiary. FMI is a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group. This is based on the Group’s interest in FMI at 31 December
2015 of 60.88% and the Roche relationship with FMI that is founded on the above agreements. The common stock of FMI is publicly
traded and is listed on the Nasdaq under the stock code ‘FMI’. FMI prepares financial statements in accordance with US GAAP which are
filed on a quarterly basis with the SEC. Due to certain consolidation entries there are differences between FMI’s stand-alone US GAAP
results and the results of FMI as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS.
Dividends. There were no dividends distributed to third parties holding FMI shares during 2015.
Divestment of subsidiary
On 23 April 2015 the Group sold its wholly owned subsidiary Marcadia Biotech, Inc. to a third party as part of the previously announced
Pharmaceuticals Division’s Research and Development reorganisation. The total consideration received was a USD 3 million convertible
note. The total loss on divestment of CHF 23 million is reported in global restructuring costs in the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating
segment and is shown in the table below. On 14 October 2015 the convertible note was repaid and the Group received USD 6 million in
cash and recognised a gain of USD 3 million.

Roche Finance Report 2015 | 87Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
25. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group’s objective is to provide attractive and competitive post-employment benefits to employees, while at the same time ensuring
that the various plans are appropriately financed and managing any potential impacts on the Group’s long-term financial position. Most
employees are covered by pension plans sponsored by Group companies. The nature of such plans varies according to legal regulations,
fiscal requirements and market practice in the countries in which the employees are employed. Post-employment benefit plans are
classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund or to a third-party financial
institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. All other plans are classified as ‘defined
benefit plans’.
Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans are funded through payments by employees and by the Group to funds administered by third parties.
The Group’s expenses for these plans were CHF 421 million (2014: CHF 364 million). No assets or liabilities are recognised in the Group’s
balance sheet in respect of such plans, apart from regular prepayments and accruals of the contributions withheld from employees’
wages and salaries and of the Group’s contributions. The Group’s major defined contribution plans are in the US, notably the US Roche
401(k) Savings Plan.
Defined benefit plans
Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by payments from Group companies and by employees.
In some cases, notably for the major defined benefit plans in Germany, the plans are unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired
employees directly from its own financial resources. Plans are usually governed by a senior governing body, such as a Board of Trustees,
which is typically composed of both employee and employer representatives. Funding of these plans is determined by local regulations
using independent actuarial valuations. Separate independent actuarial valuations, together with a semi-annual update, are prepared
in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 for use in the Group’s financial statements. The Group’s major pension plans are located
in Switzerland, the US and Germany, which in total account for 83% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation (2014: 82%).
Pension plans in Switzerland. Current pension arrangements for employees in Switzerland are made through plans governed by the
Swiss Federal Occupational Old Age, Survivors and Disability Pension Act (‘BVG’). The Group’s pension plans are administered by
separate legal foundations, which are funded by regular employee and company contributions. The final benefit is contribution-based
with certain minimum guarantees. Due to these minimum guarantees, the Swiss plans are treated as defined benefit plans for the
purposes of these IFRS financial statements, although they have many of the characteristics of defined contribution plans. Where there
is an under-funding this may be remedied by various measures such as increasing employee and company contributions, lowering the
interest rate on retirement account balances, reducing prospective benefits and a suspension of the early withdrawal facility.
Pension plans in the US. The Group’s major defined benefit plans in the US have been closed to new members since 2007. New
employees in the US now join the defined contribution plan. The largest of the remaining defined benefit plans are funded pension plans,
including separate plans originating from the Nutley, Palo Alto and Indianapolis sites, together with smaller unfunded supplementary
retirement plans. The benefits are based on the highest average annual rate of earnings during a specified period and length of
employment. The plans are non-contributory for employees, with the Group making periodic payments to the plans. In 2015 payments
made by the Group were USD 130 million (2014: USD 130 million). Where there is an under-funding, this would normally be remedied by
additional company contributions.
Pension plans in Germany. The Group’s major pension arrangements in Germany are governed by the Occupational Pensions Act
(‘BetrAVG’). These plans are unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources.
These plans are non-contributory for employees. The benefits are based on final salary and length of employment. These plans have
been closed to new members since 2007. They have been replaced by a new plan which is funded by regular employee and company
contributions and administered through a contractual trust agreement. The final benefit is contribution-based with a minimum guarantee.
Due to this minimum guarantee, this plan is treated as a defined benefit plan for the purposes of these IFRS financial statements,
although it has many of the characteristics of a defined contribution plan.
88 | Roche Finance Report 2015Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Pension plans in the Rest of the World. These represent approximately 11% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation (2014: 12%) and
consist of a number of smaller plans in various countries. Of these the largest are the pension plans at Chugai, which are independently
managed by Chugai, and the main pension plan in the United Kingdom. The Chugai plans are fully described in Chugai’s own IFRS
financial statements. The UK pension plan is funded by regular employee and company contributions, with benefits based on final salary
and length of employment. This plan has been closed to new members since 2003 and has been replaced with a defined contribution
plan.
Other post-employment benefit (‘OPEB’) plans. These represent approximately 6% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation
(2014: 6%) and consist mostly of post-retirement healthcare and life insurance schemes, mainly in the US. These plans are mainly
unfunded or are contributory for employees, with the Group reimbursing retired employees directly from its own financial resources.
The Group’s major defined benefit OPEB plans in the US have been closed to new members since 2011. Part of the costs of these plans
is reimbursable under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. There is no statutory funding
requirement for these plans. The Group is funding these plans to the extent that it is tax efficient. In 2015 there were no payments made
by the Group to these plans (2014: none). At 31 December 2015 the IFRS funding status was 45% (2014: 50%), including reimbursement
rights, for the funded OPEB plans in the US.

Funding status
The funding of the Group’s various defined benefit plans is the responsibility of a senior governing body, such as a Board of Trustees,
and the sponsoring employer, and is managed based on local statutory valuations, which follow the legislation and requirements of the
respective jurisdiction in which the plan is established. Qualified independent actuaries carry out statutory actuarial valuations on a
regular basis. The actuarial assumptions determining the funding status on the statutory basis are regularly assessed by the local senior
governing body. The funding status is closely monitored at a corporate level. The unfunded plans are mainly those in the Group’s German
affiliates, where the fully reserved pension obligations are invested in the local affiliate’s operations.
The IFRS funded status of the funded defined benefit plans remained stable at 79% (2014: 80%).
Reimbursement rights are linked to the post-employment medical plans in the US and represent the expected reimbursement of
the medical expenditure provided under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.

Plan assets
The responsibility for the investment strategies of funded plans is with the senior governance body such as the Board of Trustees. Asset-
liability studies are performed regularly for all major pension plans. These studies examine the obligations from post-retirement benefit
plans, and evaluate various investment strategies with respect to key financial measures such as expected returns, expected risks,
expected contributions, and expected funded status of the plan in an interdependent way. The goal of an asset-liability study is to select
an appropriate asset allocation for the funds held within the plan. The investment strategy is developed to optimise expected returns, to
manage risks and to contain fluctuations in the statutory funded status. Asset-liability studies include strategies to match the cash flows
of the assets with the plan obligations. The Group currently does not use annuities or longevity swaps to manage longevity risk.
Plan assets are managed using internal and external asset managers. The actual performance is continually monitored by the pension
fund governance bodies as well as being closely monitored at a corporate level. In these financial statements the difference between
the interest income and actual return on plan assets is a remeasurement that is recorded directly to other comprehensive income.
During 2015 the actual return on plan assets was a loss of CHF 7 million (2014: gain of CHF 1,020 million).
The recognition of pension assets is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available from refunds from the plans or
reductions in future contributions to the plans.

Assets are invested in a variety of different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return as follows:
• Equity and debt securities which mainly have quoted market prices (Level 1 fair value hierarchy).
• Property which is mainly in private and commercial property funds which mainly have other observable inputs (Level 2 fair value
hierarchy).
• Cash and money market instruments which are mainly invested with financial institutions with a credit rating no lower than A.
• Other investments which mainly consist of alternatives, mortgages, commodities and insurance contracts. These are used for risk
management purposes and mainly have other observable inputs (Level 2 fair value hierarchy) and unobservable inputs (Level 3
fair value hierarchy).
Included within the fair value of plan assets are the Group’s shares and non-voting securities with a fair value of CHF 171 million
(2014: CHF 153 million) and debt instruments issued by the Group with a fair value of CHF 19 million (2014: CHF 19 million).
Defined benefit obligation
The defined benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method. This reflects service rendered by employees to
the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the present value
of benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth and mortality rates. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined
by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds in countries
where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. The corporate or government bonds are denominated in the currency in which
the benefits will be paid, and have maturity terms approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
The Group’s final salary-based defined benefit pension plans in the US, Germany and the United Kingdom have been closed to new
participants. Active employees that had been members of these pension plans at the time these were closed to new participants continue
to accrue benefits in the final salary-based defined benefit pension plans. New employees in the US and UK now join the Group’s defined
contribution plans, while new employees in Germany join the contribution-based plan with a minimum guarantee. The defined benefit
pension plans in Switzerland, where the final benefit is contribution-based with a minimum guarantee, remain open to new employees.
As a result, the proportion of the defined benefit obligation which relates to these closed plans is expected to decrease in the future.

Actuarial assumptions
The actuarial assumptions used in these financial statements are based on the requirements set out in IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’.
They are unbiased and mutually compatible estimates of variables that determine the ultimate cost of providing post-employment
benefits. They are set on an annual basis by local management, based on advice from actuaries, and are subject to approval by corporate
management and the Group’s actuaries. Actuarial assumptions consist of demographic assumptions on matters such as mortality and
employee turnover, and financial assumptions on matters such as interest rates, salary and benefit levels, inflation rates and costs of
medical benefits. The actuarial assumptions vary based upon local economic and social conditions. The actuarial assumptions used in
the various statutory valuations may differ from these based on local legal and regulatory requirements.
92 | Roche Finance Report 2015Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Demographic assumptions. The most significant demographic assumptions relate to mortality rates. The Group’s actuaries use mortality
tables which take into account historic patterns and expected changes, such as further increases in longevity. Rates of employee
turnover, disability and early retirement are based on historical behaviour within Group companies. The average life expectancy assumed
now for an individual at the age of 65 is as follows:
Defined benefit plans: average life expectancy for major schemes in years
Male Female
Country Mortality table 2015 2014 2015 2014

Germany Heubeck tables 2005G 18.9 18.9 22.9 22.9
Financial assumptions. These are based on market expectations for the period over which the obligations are to be settled.
The assumptions used in the actuarial valuations are shown below.

Weighted Weighted
average Range average Range
Discount rates 2.28% 0.80%–6.50% 2.21% 0.94%–6.50%
Expected rates of salary increases 2.76% 0.00%–5.00% 2.87% 2.00%–5.00%

Ultimate medical cost trend rate (in 2029) 4.50% 4.50% 4.50% 4.50%
Discount rates are determined with reference to interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds in countries
where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. Expected rates of salary increases are based on expected inflation rates with
an adjustment to reflect the Group’s latest expectation of long-term real salary increases. Expected rates of pension increases are
generally linked to the expected inflation rate or the funding status of the plan. Expected inflation rates are derived by looking at the level
of inflation implied by the financial markets in conjunction with the economists’ price inflation forecasts, historic price inflation as well
as other economic variables and circumstances. Medical cost trend rates take into account the benefits set out in the plan terms and
expected future changes in medical costs. Since the Group’s major post-employment medical plans are for US employees, these rates
are driven by developments in the US.
Sensitivity analysis. The measurement of the net defined benefit obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate,
inflation rate, expected mortality and medical cost trend rate assumptions. The following table summarises the impact of a change in
those assumptions on the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
Defined benefit plans: sensitivity of defined benefit obligation to actuarial assumptions in millions of CHF
2015 2014
1 year increase in life expectancy 606 560

0.25% decrease (240) (323)
Immediate medical cost trend rate
1.00% increase 153 161
1.00% decrease (120) (132)
Each sensitivity analysis considers the change in one assumption at a time leaving the other assumptions unchanged. This approach
shows the isolated effect of changing one individual assumption but does not take into account that some assumptions are related.
The method used to carry out the sensitivity analysis is the same as in the prior year.

Cash flows
The Group incurred cash flows from its defined benefit plans as shown in the table below.
Defined benefit plans: cash flows in millions of CHF
2015 2014
Employer contributions, net of reimbursements – funded plans (397) (364)
Benefits paid – unfunded plans (141) (156)
Total cash inflow (outflow) (538) (520)
Based on the most recent actuarial valuations, the Group expects that employer contributions for funded plans in 2016 will be approximately
CHF 403 million, which includes an estimated CHF 155 million of additional contributions, mostly related to the US defined benefit plans.
Benefits paid for unfunded plans in 2016 are estimated to be approximately CHF 142 million, which mostly relate to the German defined
benefit plans.
26. Equity compensation plans
The Group operates several equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Chugai and Foundation Medicine. IFRS 2 ‘Share-
based Payment’ requires that the fair value of all equity compensation plan awards granted to employees be estimated at grant date and
recorded as an expense over the vesting period.

Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights. The Group issues Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) to certain
directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The S-SARs give employees the right to receive non-voting
equity securities reflecting the value of any appreciation in the market price of the non-voting equity securities between the grant date
and the exercise date. Under the Roche S-SAR Plan 180 million S-SARs will be available for issuance over a ten-year period. The rights,
which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years.

Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan. The Group issues Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) awards to certain directors, management and
employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The RSUs, which are non-tradable, represent the right to receive non-voting equity
securities which vest only after a three-year period, subject to performance conditions, if any. There are currently no performance
conditions on outstanding RSUs at 31 December 2015. Under the Roche RSU Plan 20 million non-voting equity securities will be available
for issuance over a ten-year period. The Roche RSU Plan also includes a value adjustment which will be an amount equivalent to the
sum of shareholder distributions made by the Group during the vesting period attributable to the number of non-voting equity securities
for which an individual award has been granted.

Roche Performance Share Plan. The Group offers future share and non-voting equity security awards (or, at the discretion of the
Board of Directors, their cash equivalent) to certain directors and key senior managers. These are non-tradable equity-settled awards.
The programme currently operates in annual three-year cycles. The Roche Performance Share Plan (PSP) includes a value adjustment
which will be an amount equivalent to the sum of shareholder distributions made by the Group during the vesting period attributable to
the number of shares or non-voting equity securities for which an individual award has been granted. The amount of shares or non-voting
equity securities allocated will depend upon the individual’s salary level, the achievement of performance targets linked to the Group’s
Total Shareholder Return (shares and non-voting equity securities combined) relative to the Group’s peers during the three-year period
from the date of the grant, and the discretion of the Board of Directors. Each award will result in between zero and two shares or non-
voting equity securities (before value adjustment), depending upon the achievement of the performance targets.

Roche Connect. This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the US and certain other countries, to make
regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting equity securities. It is administered by independent third parties. The Group
contributes to the programme, which allows the employees to purchase non-voting equity securities at a discount (usually 20%). The
administrator purchases the necessary non-voting equity securities directly from the market. At 31 December 2015 the administrator held
2.3 million non-voting equity securities (2014: 2.2 million). In 2015 the cost of the plan was CHF 16 million (2014: CHF 14 million).
Roche Option Plan. This programme is used in countries where S-SARs are not used. Awards under this plan give employees the right
to purchase non-voting equity securities at an exercise price specified at the grant date. The options, which are non-tradable equity-
settled awards, have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years.

28. Statement of cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities arise from the Group’s primary activities in the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics businesses. These
are calculated by the indirect method by adjusting the Group’s operating profit for any operating income and expenses that are not cash
flows (for example depreciation, amortisation and impairment) in order to derive the cash generated from operations. This and other
operating cash flows are shown in the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flows also include income taxes paid on all activities.

Group’s portfolio of marketable securities and other investments are also included, as are any interest and dividend payments received
in respect of these securities and investments. These cash flows indicate the Group’s net reinvestment in its operating assets and the
cash flow effects of business combinations and divestments, as well as the cash generated by the Group’s other investments.

Cash flows from financing activities
Cash flows from financing activities are primarily the proceeds from the issue and repayment of the Group’s equity and debt instruments.
They also include interest payments and dividend payments on these instruments. Cash flows from short-term financing, including finance
leases, are also included. These cash flows indicate the Group’s transactions with the providers of its equity and debt financing. Cash flows
from short-term borrowings are shown as a net movement, as these consist of a large number of transactions with short maturity.

29. Risk management
Group risk management
Risk management is a fundamental element of the Group’s business practice on all levels and encompasses different types of risks.
At a group level risk management is an integral part of the business planning and controlling processes. Material risks are monitored and
regularly discussed with the Corporate Executive Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising from its underlying operations and corporate finance activities. The Group’s
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices as well as
the creditworthiness and the solvency of the Group’s counterparties.
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies reviewed by the boards of directors of Roche, Chugai and Foundation
Medicine as appropriate to their areas of statutory responsibility. These policies cover credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. The
policies provide guidance on risk limits, type of authorised financial instruments and monitoring procedures. As a general principle,
the policies prohibit the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Policy implementation and day-to-day
risk management are carried out by the relevant treasury functions and regular reporting on these risks is performed by the relevant
accounting and controlling functions within Roche, Chugai and Foundation Medicine.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations, causing financial losses for
the Group. The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses of liquid funds deposited with or invested in such
counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering netting agreements and
without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements, is equal to the carrying value of the Group’s financial assets.
Accounts receivable. At 31 December 2015 the Group has trade receivables of CHF 9.0 billion (2014: CHF 9.7 billion). These are subject
to a policy of active credit risk management which focuses on the assessment of country risk, credit availability, ongoing credit evaluation
and account monitoring procedures. The objective of trade receivables management is to maximise the collection of unpaid amounts.
At 31 December 2015 the Group’s combined trade receivables balance with three US national wholesale distributors, AmerisourceBergen
Corp., McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health, Inc., was equivalent to CHF 1.5 billion representing 17% of the Group’s consolidated trade
receivables (2014: CHF 1.9 billion representing 19%). There is no other significant concentration of counterparty credit risk due to the
Group’s large number of customers and their wide geographical spread. Risk limits and exposures are continuously monitored by country
and by the nature of counterparties. The Group obtains credit insurance and similar enhancements when appropriate to protect the
collection of trade receivables. At 31 December 2015 no collateral was held for trade receivables (2014: none).
Since 2010 there have been financial difficulties in Southern European countries, notably Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. The Group
is a leading supplier to the healthcare sectors in these countries and has trade receivables of CHF 1.0 billion (2014: CHF 1.2 billion)
with the public and private customers in these countries. The Group uses different measures to improve collections in these countries,
including intense communication with customers, factoring, negotiations of payments plans, charging of interest for late payments,
and legal action.

Cash and marketable securities. At 31 December 2015 the Group has cash and marketable securities of CHF 9.2 billion
(2014: CHF 11.7 billion). These are subject to a policy of restricting exposures to high-quality counterparties and setting defined limits for
individual counterparties. These limits and counterparty credit ratings are reviewed regularly. Investments in marketable securities are
entered into on the basis of guidelines with regard to liquidity, quality and maximum amount. As a general rule, the Group invests only
in high-quality securities with adequate liquidity. Cash and short-term time deposits are subject to rules which limit the Group’s exposure
to individual financial institutions.

Master netting agreements. The Group enters into derivative transactions and collateral agreements under International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements with the respective counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty risk.
Under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same
currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria
for offsetting in the balance sheet as the Group does not have a currently enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, because the
right to offset is only enforceable on the occurrence of future events, such as a default or other credit events.
Contract terms. At 31 December 2015 there are no significant financial assets whose terms have been renegotiated (2014: none).
Impairment losses. During 2015 total impairment losses for available-for-sale financial assets amounted to CHF 10 million
(2014: CHF 9 million).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time. The Group’s
approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements at any point in time.
Roche and Chugai enjoy strong credit quality and are rated by at least one major credit rating agency. The ratings will permit efficient
access to the international capital markets in the event of major financing requirements. At 31 December 2015 the Group has unused
committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling CHF 7.7 billion (2014: CHF 5.0 billion), of which CHF 7.4 billion serve as
a back-stop line for the commercial paper program.

Take-or-pay commitments. The Group has entered into contract manufacturing agreements with various companies to further develop
manufacturing capacity and flexibility. There are future minimum take-or-pay commitments within some of these agreements with
a total potential commitment from the Group of CHF 1.0 billion at 31 December 2015. This is mainly related to a contract manufacturing
agreement in the Pharmaceuticals Division that is in effect until 2024.
Roche Finance Report 2015 | 103Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Market risk
Market risk arises from changing market prices, mainly foreign exchange rates and interest rates, of the Group’s financial assets or
financial liabilities which affect the Group’s financial result and equity.
Value-at-Risk. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to measure the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. VaR indicates the
value range within which a given financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices.
VaR is calculated using a historical simulation approach and for each scenario, all financial instruments are fully valued and the total
change in value and earnings is determined. VaR calculations are based on a 95% confidence level and a holding period of 20 trading
days over the past ten years. This holding period reflects the time required to change the corresponding risk exposure, should this be
deemed appropriate.
Actual future gains and losses associated with our treasury activities may differ materially from the VaR analyses due to the inherent
limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes to interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity investment
prices, particularly in periods of high market volatilities. Furthermore, VaR does not include the effect of changes in credit spreads.
Market risk of financial instruments in millions of CHF
2015 2014
VaR – Interest rate component 257 266
VaR – Foreign exchange component 35 32
VaR – Other price component 41 36
Diversification (47) (56)
VaR – Total market risk 286 278
The interest rate component remained largely stable. The foreign exchange component increased due to an unfavourable exposure mix.
The other price component arises mainly from movements in equity security prices and increased due to the higher market value of some
of the equity securities held by the Group.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group uses the Swiss franc as its reporting currency and as a result is exposed to movements in foreign currencies, mainly the
US dollar, Japanese yen and euro. The objective of the Group’s foreign exchange risk management activities is to preserve the economic
value of its current and future assets and to minimise the volatility of the Group’s financial result. The primary focus of the Group’s foreign
exchange risk management activities is on hedging transaction exposures arising through foreign currency flows or monetary positions
held in foreign currencies. The Group uses forward contracts, foreign exchange options and cross-currency swaps to hedge transaction
exposures. Application of these instruments intends to continuously lock in favourable developments of foreign exchange rates, thereby
reducing the exposure to potential future movements in such rates.
Interest rate risk
The Group mainly raises debt on a fixed rate basis for bonds and notes. The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates, mainly
for its US dollar, Swiss franc and euro floating rate financial instruments. The primary objective of the Group’s interest rate management
is to protect the net interest result. The Group may use forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge its interest rate exposures.
Depending on the interest rate environment of major currencies, the Group will use these instruments to generate an appropriate mix
of fixed and floating rate exposures.
104 | Roche Finance Report 2015Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Other price risk
Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities. The Group manages the price risk through placing limits
on individual and total equity investments. These limits are defined both as a percentage of total liquid funds and as an absolute number
for individual equity investments.
Capital management
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total capitalisation, being the sum of debt plus equity, including non-
controlling interests. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide benefits for patients and returns to
investors.
• To provide an adequate return to investors based on the level of risk undertaken.
• To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver future benefits for patients and
returns to investors.
• To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The capitalisation is reported to senior management as part of the Group’s regular internal management reporting and is shown in
the table below.

The Group’s net equity was significantly impacted by the 2009 Genentech transaction (see Note 21).
The Group is not subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements as known in the financial services industry. The Group has majority
shareholdings in Chugai and Foundation Medicine (see Note 22). Chugai and Foundation Medicine are public companies and their
objectives, policies and processes for managing their own capital are determined by local management.

Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
• Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
• Level 2 – observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
• Level 3 – unobservable inputs.

Contingent consideration – – (815) (815)
Financial liabilities recognised at fair value – (673) (815) (1,488)
Level 1 financial assets consist of treasury bills, bonds and quoted shares. Level 2 financial assets consist primarily of commercial paper,
certificates of deposit and derivative financial instruments.
The Group determines Level 2 fair values using the following valuation techniques:
• Marketable securities and derivative financial instruments are based on valuation models that use observable market data for interest
rates, yield curves, foreign exchange rates and implied volatilities for similar instruments at the measurement date.
• Available-for-sale investments using a valuation model derived from the most recently published observable financial prices.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period during which the transfer
has occurred. There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and vice versa during the year (2014: none).

Contingent consideration arrangements
The Group is party to certain contingent consideration arrangements arising from business combinations. The fair values are determined
considering the expected payments, discounted to present value using risk-adjusted average discount rate of 3.9% (2014: 4.1%).
The expected payments are determined by considering the possible scenarios of forecast sales and other performance criteria, the amount
to be paid under each scenario, and the probability of each scenario. The significant unobservable inputs are the forecast sales, other
performance criteria and the risk-adjusted discount rate. The estimated fair value would increase if the forecast sales or other performance
criteria rate was higher or the risk-adjusted discount rate was lower. At 31 December 2015 the total potential payments under contingent
consideration arrangements could be up to CHF 2.9 billion (2014: CHF 2.2 billion) as follows:

Hedge accounting
At 31 December 2015 the Group has the following cash flow hedges and fair value hedges which are designated in a qualifying hedge
relationship.
Cash flow hedges. The Group has entered into cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk on some of
the bonds and notes issued by the Group which are denominated in euro and pound sterling. At 31 December 2015 such instruments
are recorded as a net fair value liability of CHF 561 million (2014: CHF 69 million). There was no ineffective portion.
Chugai has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a part of its foreign translation exposure to Swiss franc and
US dollar. At 31 December 2015 such instruments are recorded as fair value liabilities of CHF 20 million (2014: CHF 14 million).
There was no ineffective portion.
The expected undiscounted cash flows from qualifying cash flow hedges, including interest payments during the duration of the derivative
contract and final settlement on maturity, are shown in the table below.

The changes in the hedging reserve within equity are shown in Note 21.
Fair value hedges. The Group has entered into some interest rate swaps to hedge some of its fixed-term debt instruments.
At 31 December 2015 such instruments are recorded as fair value liabilities of CHF 6 million (2014: CHF 34 million) and fair value assets
of CHF 35 million (2014: CHF 19 million). During 2015 a gain of CHF 44 million was recorded on these interest rate swaps (2014: gain of
CHF 42 million). As the fair value hedge had been highly effective since inception, the result of the interest rate swaps was largely offset
by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt instruments.
At 31 December 2014 the Group had forward contracts to manage the risk of market fluctuations for equity investments in various
biotechnology companies. The forward contracts were recorded as fair value liabilities of CHF 384 million at 31 December 2014. During
2015 the hedged equity investments were sold and all of the forward contracts were settled. This resulted in a loss on the forward
contracts of CHF 354 million (2014: loss of CHF 114 million). The loss on the forward contracts was more than offset by the gain on sale
of the hedged equity investments and was recorded in net gains on sale of equity securities (see Note 3).
Net investment hedges. The Group does not have any net investment hedges.

116 | Roche Finance Report 2015Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
32. Significant accounting policies
Consolidation policy
Subsidiaries are all companies (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when
the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the entity. Companies acquired during the year are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to
the Group, and subsidiaries to be divested are included up to the date on which control passes from the Group. Inter-company balances,
transactions and resulting unrealised income are eliminated in full. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for
as equity transactions if they occur after control has already been obtained and if they do not result in a loss of control. Associates are
companies over which the Group exercises, or has the power to exercise, significant influence, but which it does not control and they
are accounted for using the equity method.
Segment reporting
For the purpose of segment reporting the Group’s Corporate Executive Committee (CEC) is considered to be the Group’s Chief Operating
Decision Maker. The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the organisation units for which information is reported
to the CEC on a regular basis. The information provided is used as the basis of the segment revenue and profit disclosures reported in
Note 2, with the geographic analysis based on the location of customers. Selected segment balance sheet information is also routinely
provided to the CEC.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis. Operating assets and liabilities consist of property, plant
and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade receivables/payables, inventories and other assets and liabilities, such as provisions,
which can be reasonably attributed to the reported operating segments. Non-operating assets and liabilities mainly include current
and deferred income tax balances, post-employment benefit assets/liabilities and financial assets/liabilities such as cash, marketable
securities, investments and debt.
Foreign currency translation
The Annual Financial Statements are presented in Swiss francs. Most Group companies use their local currency as their functional
currency. Certain Group companies use other currencies (such as US dollar, Swiss franc or euro) as their functional currency where
this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Local transactions in other currencies are initially
reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses from the settlement of such transactions and gains
and losses on translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are included in income, except when they
are qualifying cash flow hedges or arise on monetary items that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign entity.
In such cases the gains and losses are deferred into other comprehensive income.
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using functional currencies other than Swiss francs are translated into
Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange. The income statement and statement of cash flows are translated at the average rates
of exchange for the year. Translation differences due to the changes in exchange rates between the beginning and the end of the year
and the difference between net income translated at the average and year-end exchange rates are taken directly to other comprehensive
income.
Roche Finance Report 2015 | 117Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Revenues
Sales represent amounts received and receivable for goods supplied to customers after deducting trade discounts, cash discounts
and volume rebates, and exclude value added taxes and other taxes directly linked to sales. Revenues from the sale of products are
recognised upon transfer to the customer of significant risks and rewards. Trade discounts, cash discounts and volume rebates are
recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of the related sales. Estimates of expected sales returns, charge-backs
and other rebates, including Medicaid in the US and similar rebates in other countries, are also deducted from sales and recorded as
accrued liabilities or provisions or as a deduction from accounts receivable. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual
or legislatively mandated obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience. If the circumstances are such that the level of sales
returns, and hence revenues, cannot be reliably measured, then sales are only recognised when the right of return expires, which is
generally upon prescription of the products to patients. Other revenues are recorded as earned or as the services are performed. Single
transactions are split into separately identifiable components to reflect the substance of the transaction, where necessary. Conversely,
two or more transactions may be considered together for revenue recognition purposes, where the commercial effect cannot be
understood without reference to the series of transactions as a whole.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and related production overheads of goods sold and services rendered.
Royalties, alliance and collaboration expenses, including all collaboration profit-sharing arrangements are also reported as part of cost
of sales. Start-up costs between validation and the achievement of normal production capacity are expensed as incurred.
Research and development
Internal research and development activities are expensed as incurred for the following:
• Internal research costs incurred for the purpose of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.
• Internal development costs incurred for the application of research findings or other knowledge to plan and develop new products
for commercial production. The development projects undertaken by the Group are subject to technical, regulatory and other
uncertainties, such that, in the opinion of management, the criteria for capitalisation as intangible assets are not met prior to obtaining
marketing approval by the regulatory authorities in major markets.
• Post-marketing studies after regulatory approval, such as phase IV costs in the pharmaceuticals business, generally involve safety
surveillance and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives marketing approval to be sold. They may be required by
regulatory authorities or may be undertaken for safety or commercial reasons. The costs of such post-marketing studies are not
capitalised as intangible assets, as in the opinion of management, they do not generate separately identifiable incremental future
economic benefits that can be reliably measured.
Acquired in-process research and development resources obtained through in-licensing arrangements, business combinations or
separate asset purchases are capitalised as intangible assets. The acquired asset must be controlled by the Group, be separately
identifiable and expected to generate future economic benefits, even if uncertainty exists as to whether the research and development
will ultimately result in a marketable product. Consequently, upfront and milestone payments to third parties for pharmaceutical products
or compounds before regulatory marketing approval are recognised as intangible assets. Assets acquired through such arrangements
are measured on the basis set out in the ‘Intangible assets’ policy. Subsequent internal research and development costs incurred post-
acquisition are treated in the same way as other internal research and development costs. If research and development are embedded
in contracts for strategic alliances, the Group carefully assesses whether upfront or milestone payments constitute funding of research
and development work or acquisition of an asset.
Licensing, milestone and other upfront receipts
Royalty income is recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the respective licensing agreements. If the
collectability of a royalty amount is not reasonably assured, those royalties are recognised as revenue when the cash is received. Certain
Group companies receive upfront, milestone and other similar payments from third parties relating to the sale or licensing of products
or technology. Revenue associated with performance milestones is recognised based on achievement of the deliverables as defined
in the respective agreements. Upfront payments and licence fees for which there are subsequent deliverables are initially reported
as deferred income and are recognised in income as earned over the period of the development collaboration or the manufacturing
obligation.

Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits include wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, profit sharing and
bonuses, and non-monetary benefits for current employees. The costs are recognised within the operating results when the employee
has rendered the associated service. The Group recognises a liability for profit sharing and bonuses where contractually obliged or
where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Long-term employee benefits include long-service or sabbatical leave, long-service benefits and long-term disability benefits.
The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment. Any changes in the carrying value of other long-term
employee benefit liabilities are recognised within the operating results.
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. Termination costs are recognised at the earlier of when
the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of the benefits or when the Group recognises any related restructuring costs.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
For defined contribution plans the Group contributions are recognised within the operating results when the employee has rendered
the associated service. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future
payments is available.
For defined benefit plans the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair
value of the plan assets. All changes in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as they occur as follows:
Recognised in the income statement:
• Current service costs are charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results.
• Past service costs, including curtailment gains or losses, are recognised immediately in general and administration within the operating
results.
• Settlement gains or losses are recognised in general and administration within the operating results.
• Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is recognised in financing costs.
Recognised in other comprehensive income:
• Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments (the difference between previous assumptions and what has actually
occurred) and changes in actuarial assumptions.
• The return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability.
• Any change in the limit on the recognition of plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is comprised of interest income on plan assets, interest cost on the defined benefit
obligation and interest on the effect of the limit on the recognition of pension assets. The net interest is calculated using the same
discount rate that is used in calculating the defined benefit obligation, applied to the net defined liability at the start of the period, taking
account of any changes from contribution or benefit payments.
Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to use
the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan.
Equity compensation plans
The fair value of all equity compensation awards granted to employees is estimated at the grant date and recorded as an expense over
the vesting period. The expense is charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results. For equity-settled
plans, an increase in equity is recorded for this expense and any subsequent cash flows from exercises of vested awards are recorded
as changes in equity.
Roche Finance Report 2015 | 119Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction, and include all costs directly attributable to
bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
These include items such as costs of site preparation, installation and assembly costs and professional fees. The net costs of testing
whether the asset is functioning properly, including validation costs, are also included in the initially recorded cost of construction.
Interest and other borrowing costs incurred with respect to qualifying assets are capitalised and included in the carrying value of the
assets. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis, except for land, which is not depreciated. The estimated
useful lives of major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
Land improvements 40 years
Buildings 10–50 years
Machinery and equipment 4–15 years
Diagnostic instruments 3–5 years
Office equipment 3–6 years
Motor vehicles 5–8 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate components.
The estimated useful lives of the assets are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation charges are accelerated. Repairs
and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Leases
Where the Group is the lessee. Finance leases exist when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the
Group. Finance leases are capitalised at the start of the lease at fair value, or the present value of the minimum lease payments, if lower.
The rental obligation, net of finance charges, is reported within debt. Finance lease assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease
term and its useful life. The interest element of the lease payment is charged against income over the lease term based on the effective
interest rate method. Operating leases exist when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group.
Payments made under operating leases are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where the Group is the lessor. Certain assets, mainly Diagnostics instruments, are leased to third parties through both finance and
operating lease arrangements. Finance lease assets are reported as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease.
Lease income from finance leases is recognised over the term of the lease based on the effective interest rate method. Operating lease
assets are reported within property, plant and equipment. Lease income from operating leases is recognised over the lease term on
a straight-line basis.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. At the date of acquisition the Group initially
recognises the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired
business. The consideration transferred is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. Where the Group does not acquire 100%
ownership of the acquired business, non-controlling interests are recorded either at fair value or as the proportion of the fair value
of the acquired net assets attributable to the non-controlling interest. Directly attributable acquisition-related costs are expensed as
incurred within general and administration expenses.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises in a business combination and is the excess of the consideration transferred to acquire the business over the underlying
fair value of the net identified assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually and upon the
occurrence of an indication of impairment.
120 | Roche Finance Report 2015Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Intangible assets
Purchased patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Assets that have been acquired
through a business combination are initially recorded at fair value. Once available for use, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-
line basis over their useful lives. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date. The estimated useful life is the
lower of the legal duration and the economic useful life. The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are regularly reviewed. Estimated
useful lives of major classes of amortisable intangible assets are as follows:
Product intangibles in use up to 20 years
Marketing intangibles in use up to 10 years
Technology intangibles in use up to 14 years
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
An impairment assessment is carried out when there is evidence that an asset may be impaired. In addition intangible assets that
are not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. When the recoverable amount of an asset, being the higher of its fair value
less costs of disposal and its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value is reduced to its recoverable amount.
This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. Value in use is calculated using estimated cash flows, generally
over a five-year period, with extrapolating projections for subsequent years. These are discounted using an appropriate long-term
interest rate. When an impairment loss arises, the useful life of the asset is reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation/
amortisation charge is accelerated. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively
to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the
income statement as an impairment reversal.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is assessed for impairment at each reporting date and is additionally tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is allocated to
cash-generating units and when the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, being the higher of its fair value less costs of
disposal or its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value of the goodwill is reduced to its recoverable amount.
This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. When an acquired business, that is included within a cash-
generating unit, permanently ceases to operate then it is treated as a disposal of that business. For separately identifiable goodwill that
was generated on the initial acquisition of that business and where all of the factors that made up that goodwill are entirely unrelated
to the continuing operations of the cash-generating unit, then the goodwill is deemed to have been disposed of and is fully impaired.
The impairment testing methodology is further described in Note 8.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods and work in process includes raw
materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs and overheads based upon the normal capacity of production facilities.
Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to completion
and selling expenses.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts, trade discounts, cash
discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded where there is objective evidence that
the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. These estimates are based on specific indicators, such as the ageing of customer
balances, specific credit circumstances and the Group’s historical experience, taking also into account economic conditions. Expenses
for doubtful trade receivables are recognised within marketing and distribution expenses. Trade discounts, cash discounts, volume
rebates and similar allowances are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of the related sales, using estimates
based on existing contractual obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience.
Roche Finance Report 2015 | 121Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and time, call and current balances with banks and similar institutions. Such balances
are only reported as cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes
in their fair value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to an outflow of resources
that can be reliably estimated. In particular, restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan that has
either commenced implementation or has been announced. Provisions are recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to
arise and are discounted when the time value of money is material. A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation
will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability. Contingent
assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Fair values
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices or by the use of established valuation
techniques such as option pricing models and the discounted cash flow method if quoted prices in an active market are not available.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are classified into the following categories which are disclosed in Note 29.
Available-for-sale. These are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated as such or are not classified in any other
financial asset category. Available-for-sale assets are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Changes in fair value are
recorded in other comprehensive income, except for impairments and interest and foreign exchange components. When an investment
is derecognised, the cumulative gains and losses in equity are reclassified to financial income (expense). Available-for-sale assets are
mainly comprised of marketable securities.
Fair value – hedging instruments. These are derivative financial instruments that are used to manage the exposures to foreign currency,
interest rate, equity market and credit risks. Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value.
Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, all changes in fair value are recorded as other
financial income (expense).
Fair value – designated. These are non-derivative financial instruments that are designated as fair value through profit or loss on initial
recognition. Designated fair value instruments are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value with changes in fair value
recorded in the income statement. Designated fair value instruments are mainly comprised of contingent consideration liabilities with
changes in fair value recorded in general and administration within the operating results.
Loans and receivables. These are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. Loans and receivables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest
rate method, less any impairment losses. Loans and receivables are mainly comprised of accounts receivable and cash and cash
equivalents.
Other financial liabilities. These are non-derivative financial liabilities. Other financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value and
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Other financial liabilities are mainly comprised of debt
and trade payables.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual cash flows from the asset expire or when the Group transfers the rights to receive
the contractual cash flows from the financial assets in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the
financial asset are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when the contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
122 | Roche Finance Report 2015Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are individually assessed for possible impairment at each reporting date. An impairment charge is recorded where there
is objective evidence of impairment, such as where the issuer is in bankruptcy, default or other significant financial difficulty. Available-
for-sale equity securities that have a market value of more than 25% below their original cost, or have a market value below their original
cost for a sustained six-month period will be considered as impaired.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, any impairment charge is the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable
amount, calculated using estimated future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate. For available-for-sale financial
assets, any impairment charge is the amount currently carried in other comprehensive income for the difference between the original
cost and the fair value.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
For debt securities measured at amortised cost or available-for-sale, the reversal is recognised in income. For equity securities held as
available-for-sale, the reversal is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Hedge accounting
The Group uses derivatives to manage its exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. The instruments
used may include interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, forwards contracts and options. The Group generally limits the use of
hedge accounting to certain significant transactions. To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict
conditions on documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. While many of these
transactions can be considered as hedges in economic terms, if the required conditions are not met, then the relationship does not
qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no
hedging relationship, which means that any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial income
(expense).
Cash flow hedge. This is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a
recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss. The hedging instrument is recorded
at fair value. The effective portion of the hedge is included in other comprehensive income and any ineffective portion is reported in
financial income (expense). If the hedging relationship is the hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment or highly probable
forecasted transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging
instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying value of the non-financial item at
the date of recognition. For all other cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been
recorded in other comprehensive income are included in financial income (expense) when the forecasted transaction affects net income.
Fair value hedge. This is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or an unrecognised firm
commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect
profit or loss. The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item is recorded at its previous carrying value, adjusted for
any changes in fair value that are attributable to the hedged risk. Changes in the fair values are reported in financial income (expense).
Debt
Debt instruments are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Subsequently they are reported
at amortised cost. Any discount between the net proceeds received and the principal value due on redemption is amortised over the
duration of the debt instrument and is recognised as part of financing costs using the effective interest rate method.
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding taxes payable on the distribution of
retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based on income, such as property and capital taxes, are included within general and
administration expenses.
Liabilities for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally relating to
subsidiaries, are only recognised where it is probable that such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future.
Roche Finance Report 2015 | 123Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
carrying values. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the same taxation authority and when there
is a legally enforceable right to offset them. Deferred taxes are determined based on the currently enacted tax rates applicable in each
tax jurisdiction where the Group operates.
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The original purchase cost, consideration
received for subsequent resale of these equity instruments and other movements are reported as changes in equity. These instruments
are held for the Group’s potential conversion obligations that may arise from the Group’s equity compensation plans.
Changes in accounting policies
In 2015 the Group has implemented various minor amendments to existing standards and interpretations, which have no material impact
on the Group’s overall results and financial position.
Future new and revised standards
The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of the various new and revised standards and interpretations that will be
mandatory from 1 January 2016 which the Group has not yet applied. Based on the analysis to date, the Group does not anticipate that
these will have a material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position. The Group is also assessing other new and revised
standards which are not mandatory until after 2016, notably IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, IFRS 15 ‘Revenues from Contracts with
Customers’ and IFRS 16 ‘Leases’.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate control over
financial reporting. The internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance over the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2015 based on
the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework version 2013 issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has
concluded that the system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 31 December 2015.
The Statutory Auditor KPMG AG has audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended
31 December 2015, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA). They have
also issued a report on the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control over financial reporting. This report is set out on
page 127.

Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Consolidated Financial Statements
As statutory auditor, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, which comprise
the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, statement of changes in equity and
notes on pages 36 to 124 for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Board of Directors’ Responsibility. The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the requirements of Swiss law. This responsibility includes
designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of consolidated financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and
applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s Responsibility. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, Swiss Auditing Standards and International Standards on Auditing. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements are
free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the
internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and
the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 give a true and fair view of
the financial position, the results of operations and the cash flows in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),
and comply with Swiss law.
Report on Other Legal Requirements
We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA) and independence
(article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence.
In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists,
which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.
We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

Report of the Independent Auditor on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting to the
Board of Directors of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
Report of the Independent Auditor on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have examined the Roche Group’s system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2015, based on criteria
established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework version 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as included in the accompanying Report
of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our examination. An entity’s internal control over financial reporting is a process effected by
the entity’s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and includes those policies
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of the unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that
could have a material effect on the entity’s financial statements.
We conducted our examination in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000).
This standard requires that we plan and perform our examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our examination included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of management override of
controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that internal control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or because the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Roche Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
31 December 2015 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework version 2013 issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and International Standards on Auditing, the consolidated financial
statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended 31 December 2015 and our report dated 26 January 2016 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Supplementary core results and EPS information
The Group’s basic and diluted earnings per share is given in Note 27 to the Annual Financial Statements. To allow for a transparent
assessment of both the actual results and the underlying performance of the business the full income statement for the Group and
the operating results of the Divisions are shown on both an IFRS and core basis.
The core results concept, which is used in the internal management of the business, is based on the IFRS results, with the following
adjustments:
• Global restructuring plans (see Note 6) are excluded.
• Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (see Note 9) and impairment of goodwill (see Note 8) are excluded.
• Acquisition accounting and other one-time impacts from Alliance arrangements and Business Combinations (see Financial Review)
are excluded.
• Discontinued operations (currently none) would be excluded.
• Legal and environmental expenses (see Financial Review) are excluded.
• Global issues outside the healthcare sector beyond the Group’s control (currently none) would be excluded.
• Material one-time treasury items such as major debt restructurings (see Note 20) are excluded.
• Pension plan settlements (see Note 25) are excluded.
• The tax benefit recorded under IFRS in respect of Equity Compensation Plans (ECPs), which varies according to price of the underlying
equity, is replaced by a normalised tax benefit, being the IFRS 2 expense multiplied by the applicable tax rate (see Note 4).
The core results concept was further described on 22 October 2010 at an Investor Update teleconference, which is available for
download at: http://www.roche.com/investors/ir_agenda/csr_151010.htm
The Group’s IFRS results, including the Divisional breakdown, are reconciled to the core results in the tables below. The calculation of
Core EPS is also given in the tables below. Additional commentary to the adjustment items is given in the Financial Review.

136 | Roche Finance Report 2015Multi-Year Overview and Supplementary Information | Roche Group
Non-GAAP measures
The financial information included in the Financial Review includes certain non-GAAP measures which are not accounting measures
as defined by IFRS, in particular, the core results, net working capital, net operating assets, free cash flow and constant exchange rates.
These non-GAAP measures should not be used instead of, or considered as alternatives to, the Group’s consolidated financial results
based on IFRS. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies.
Core results
Core results allow for an assessment of both the Group’s actual results as defined by IFRS and the underlying performance of the business.
The core results concept is explained on page 131.
Net working capital
Net working capital is used to assess the Group’s efficiency in utilising assets and short-term liquidity. Net trade working capital is
calculated as trade receivables and inventories minus trade payables. Net working capital is calculated as net trade working capital
adjusted for other receivables and other payables.
Net operating assets
Net operating assets allow for an assessment of the Group’s operating performance of the business independently from financing and
tax activities. Net operating assets are calculated as property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, net working capital and
long-term net operating assets minus provisions.
Free cash flow
Free cash flow is used to assess the Group’s ability to generate the cash required to conduct and maintain its operations. Operating free
cash flow is calculated based on the IFRS operating profit and adjusted for certain cash items, movements in net working capital and
capital expenditures (investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets). Free cash flow is calculated as the operating
free cash flow adjusted for treasury activities, taxes paid and dividends paid.
Constant exchange rates
Certain percentage changes in the Financial Review have been calculated using constant exchange rates (‘CER’) which allow for an
assessment of the Group’s financial performance with the effects of exchange rate fluctuations eliminated. The percentage changes
at constant exchange rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the current reported period and the prior period
numbers at constant currency exchange rates, equalling the average exchange rates for the prior year. For example, a CER change
between a 2015 line item and its 2014 equivalent is calculated using the average exchange rate for the year ended 31 December 2014 for
both the 2015 line item and the 2014 line item and subsequently calculating the change in percent with respect to the two recalculated
numbers.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel (the ‘Company’) have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Swiss Law
on Accounting and Financial Reporting (32nd title of the Swiss Code of Obligations). Where not prescribed by law, the significant
accounting principles applied are described below.
The changes from the new law on accounting and financial reporting contained in the 32nd title of the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO)
were adopted on 1 January 2015 and the comparative financial information for 2014 has been adjusted.
The Company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with a recognised accounting standard (International
Financial Reporting Standards). In accordance with the CO the Company decided to forgo presenting additional information on audit fees
in the notes as well as a cash flow statement.
Valuation methods and translation of foreign currencies
Marketable securities are reported at the lower of cost or market value. All other financial assets, including investments, are reported at
cost less appropriate write-downs. Own equity instruments are recognised at cost and deducted from equity at the time of purchase.
If the own equity instruments are sold, the gain or loss is recognised through the income statement. Assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange, except investments which are translated at
historical rates. Transactions during the year which are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates effective
at the relevant transaction dates. Resulting exchange gains and losses are recognised in the income statement with the exception of
unrealised gains which are deferred.
Investments
The major direct and indirect investments of the company are listed in Note 31 to the Roche Group Annual Financial Statements.
Ownership interests equal voting rights.
Taxes
Direct taxes include corporate income and capital taxes.
2. Shareholders’ equity
Share capital
As in the previous year, share capital amounts to CHF 160 million. The share capital consists of 160,000,000 bearer shares with a nominal
value of CHF 1 each. Included in equity are 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine). They are not part of the share
capital and confer no voting rights. However, each non-voting equity security confers the same rights as any of the shares to participate
in the available earnings and in any remaining proceeds from liquidation following repayment of the nominal value of the share capital and,
if any, participation certificates.
Roche Finance Report 2015 | 143Roche Holding Ltd, Basel | Notes to the Financial Statements

Report of the Statutory Auditor
to the General Meeting of Shareholders
of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Financial Statements
As statutory auditor, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, which comprise the balance sheet,
income statement and notes on pages 141 to 148 for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Board of Directors’ Responsibility. The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance
with the requirements of Swiss law and the company’s Articles of Incorporation. This responsibility includes designing, implementing
and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies
and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s Responsibility. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control
system relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control system. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 comply with Swiss law and the company’s
Articles of Incorporation.
Report on Other Legal Requirements
We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA) and independence
(article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence.
In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system
exists, which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.
We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the company’s Articles of
Incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

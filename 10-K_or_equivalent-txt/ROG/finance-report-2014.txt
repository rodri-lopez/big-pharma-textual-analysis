Roche in 2014
The Roche Group reported solid overall results in 2014. Sales grew by 5% at constant exchange rates (CER) while core earnings per share also
increased by 5%. Excluding the impact of a double charge of 202 million Swiss francs related to the US Branded Prescription Drug fee, underlying
earnings grew at 7%.
Sales
Group sales increased by 5% (CER) to 47.5 billion Swiss francs (1% growth in Swiss franc terms).
Pharmaceuticals sales growth was 4% (CER). There was continued growth in the HER2 franchise and Avastin in the oncology portfolio as well
as for Tamiflu, Actemra/RoActemra and Xolair. Sales of Xeloda and Pegasys decreased.
Diagnostics sales showed growth of 6% (CER) with Professional Diagnostics being the major contributor.
Operating results
Core operating profit increased by 3% (CER) to 17.6 billion Swiss francs (1% decline in Swiss franc terms). Excluding the double charge
for the US Branded Prescription Drug fee, underlying operating profit grew at 5%.
Research and development expenditure grew by 4% (CER) to 8.9 billion Swiss francs on a core basis, with focus on the oncology,
neuroscience and immunology therapeutic areas. Research and development costs were 18.8% of Group sales.
IFRS operating results include non-core expenses of 3.5 billion Swiss francs. This includes 2.6 billion Swiss francs for the amortisation and
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets as well as 0.7 billion Swiss francs from global restructuring plans and business combinations.
Non-operating results
Core net financial expenses decreased by 0.6 billion Swiss francs to 1.1 billion Swiss francs, driven by income from divestments of equity
securities and lower interest expenses.
IFRS net financial expenses additionally includes a loss of 0.4 billion Swiss francs from a non-core major debt restructuring.
Net income
IFRS net income decreased by 10% at CER to 9.5 billion Swiss francs (16% decline in Swiss franc terms), due to higher impairments of goodwill
and intangible assets and higher global restructuring charges including a base effect of income of 0.5 billion Swiss francs from the reversal of
impairment charges in the 2013 results.
Core earnings per share increased by 5% at CER (0% in Swiss francs terms). Excluding the impact of the double charge of the US Branded
Prescription Drug fee, underlying earnings grew at 7%.
Cash flows
Operating free cash flow was 15.8 billion Swiss francs, a decrease of 2% at CER. The underlying growth in the operating business was offset
by higher capital expenditure.
Free cash flow increased by 1% at CER to 5.3 billion Swiss francs, driven by sales of equity securities and lower interest payments.
Mergers and acquisitions, notably the InterMune acquisition, utilised 9.6 billion Swiss francs of cash. 5.75 billion US dollars of this was
financed through new debt issuances.
Repayment of debt is ahead of schedule with 74% of the notes and bonds issued in 2009 to finance the Genentech transaction being repaid
by the end of 2014.
Financial position
Net working capital increased by 4% (CER ), due to higher levels of inventories from the InterMune inventory fair value adjustment,
for launches and growth of key products, higher safety stock levels and increased demand in key markets.
Net debt increased by 7.3 billion Swiss francs to 14.0 billion Swiss francs, mainly due to the InterMune acquisition. Net debt as a percentage
of total assets was 19%.
Credit ratings strong: Moody’s at A1 and Standard & Poor’s at AA.
Shareholder return
Dividends. A proposal will be made to increase dividends by 3% to 8.00 Swiss francs per share. This will represent the 28th consecutive year
of dividend growth and will result in a pay-out ratio of 56.0%, subject to AGM approval.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) was 12% representing a combined performance of share and non-voting equity security.Roche Group

The Roche Group’s results for 2014 showed growth in its core operating activities, with sales up by 5% and core operating profit up
by 3% at constant exchange rates. Sales increased driven by the oncology portfolio, especially the medicines for HER2-positive breast
cancer, and by the Professional Diagnostics business. Core operating profit grew below the rate of the sales increase due to a double
charge of 202 million Swiss francs related to the US Branded Prescription Drug fee. The solid operating performance, combined with
higher income from sales of equity securities and lower financing costs, lead to an increase in Core EPS of 5% at constant exchange
rates. Excluding the double charge underlying earnings grew at 7%. Operating free cash flow was 15.8 billion Swiss francs or 33% of
sales.
Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division rose by 4% to 36.7 billion Swiss francs. This was driven by the oncology portfolio, especially by
the HER2 franchise which grew by 20%. There was also strong demand for Actemra/RoActemra and Xolair, with sales increasing by 23%
and 25%, respectively. Sales of Xeloda were lower as it is now off-patent in the US and Europe. Regional growth was most significant in
the US, Europe and Latin America. Diagnostics sales grew at 6%, consolidating the Division’s leading market position. The major growth
area was Professional Diagnostics, while sales in Diabetes Care increased slightly.
Core operating profit increased by 3%, with the Pharmaceuticals Division growing at 4% and the Diagnostics Division at 2%. Profit in
Pharmaceuticals grew due to the good sales growth. Marketing and distribution costs included the launch and rollout of new products,
notably for the newly acquired product Esbriet, and investments in emerging markets, as well as increasing patient access to medicines.
In research and development there were continued investments in the oncology, neuroscience and immunology therapeutic areas.
In July 2014, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued the final regulations related to the Branded Prescription Drug fee which
fundamentally changed a key assumption about the triggering event for liability recognition. As a result there was a one-time double
charge with an operating profit impact of 202 million Swiss francs. In Diagnostics core operating profit grew due to the sales growth,
offset by the base effect of pension plan changes in 2013. Excluding the double charge, the Group’s core operating profit grew at 5%.
Operating free cash flow was 15.8 billion Swiss francs, a decrease of 2%. The strong cash generation of the underlying operations was
offset by higher capital investments in manufacturing facilities and other site development projects. The free cash flow increased by 1% at
constant exchange rates to 5.3 billion Swiss francs, driven by sales of equity securities and lower interest and tax payments which more
than offset the higher annual dividend payments.
Roche Finance Report 2014 | 3Roche Group | Financial Review
During 2014 the Group continued with the implementation of several major global restructuring plans initiated in prior years, notably
the programme to address long-term profitability in the Diabetes Care business in the Diagnostics Division. The total costs of the Group’s
restructuring activities in 2014 were 0.7 billion Swiss francs. Impairment charges of 1.9 billion Swiss francs were recorded for goodwill
and intangible assets, mainly in the Tissue Diagnostics business. A major debt restructuring to refinance some of the Group’s long-term
debt resulted in a loss of 0.4 billion Swiss francs. These negative factors, combined with a base effect of income of 0.5 billion Swiss francs
from the reversal of impairment charges in the 2013 results, in total turned the 6% increase in core net income to a 10% decrease in net
income on an IFRS basis.
Comparing average exchange rates in 2014 with average exchange rates during 2013, the Swiss franc was stronger against many major
currencies, in particular the Japanese yen, the US dollar, the euro and major Latin American currencies. The overall impact is strongly
negative on the results expressed in Swiss francs compared to constant exchange rates, with a 4–5 percentage point impact on sales,
core operating profit and Core EPS.
On 15 January 2015 the Swiss National Bank (SNB) announced that it was discontinuing the minimum exchange rate of 1.20 Swiss francs
per euro. As a consequence, stock markets in Switzerland fell significantly and the value of the Swiss franc increased dramatically.
For the Roche Group, no fundamental impact is foreseen. For example, the Group incurs less than 20% of its overall costs in Switzerland.
By the same token, key markets such as the US, Europe and Japan have complete value chains, meaning that costs are incurred in local
currencies, not in Swiss francs. The amounts reported in this Financial Report do not reflect changes in exchange rates after 31 December
2014. Since the Group uses the Swiss franc as the presentation currency in its consolidated financial statements, then a weakening of
foreign currencies against the Swiss franc will have a negative currency translation impact on the Group’s consolidated results when
reported in Swiss francs. The currency translation sensitivity of the Group’s results to movements in foreign currency exchange rates is
included on pages 29 to 30.

Sales
In 2014 sales increased by 5% at constant exchange rates (+1% in Swiss francs; +3% in US dollars) to 47.5 billion Swiss francs.
Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division rose 4% to 36.7 billion Swiss francs, driven by strong growth in the HER2 franchise, as well as
by Avastin, Tamiflu, Actemra/RoActemra, Xolair and MabThera/Rituxan. Sales grew in all regions, and particularly in the US where the
HER2 franchise grew by 27%. Xeloda and Pegasys sales both declined. Xeloda is now off-patent in the US and Europe and subject to
generic competition in these markets, while Pegasys is subject to increased competition from new therapies. The Diagnostics Division
recorded sales of 10.8 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 6% at constant exchange rates, consolidating its leading market position.
The major growth area was Professional Diagnostics, which represents more than half of the Division’s sales and grew by 8%, led by
the immunodiagnostics business. Diabetes Care sales increased by 1% despite continued US reimbursement cuts and pricing pressure.

Core operating results
Currency translation had a significant impact on the operating results, with a negative effect of 0.6 percentage points on the development
of the Group and Pharmaceuticals Division core operating margins, and a negative effect of 0.4 percentage points on the core operating
margin of the Diagnostics Division.
Pharmaceuticals Division. The Division increased its core operating profit by 4% at constant exchange rates, driven by sales growth
of 4%. There were continued marketing activities for new products and in emerging markets, including patient access programmes.
Research and development costs increased by 4%, with the focus being on the oncology, neuroscience and immunology therapeutic
areas. General and administration costs increased by 50% due to the US Branded Prescription Drug fee double charge and the base
effect of income from changes to the Group’s pension plans in the 2013 results. There was additional one-off income from the divestment
of the filgrastim franchise rights. Excluding the double charge, the Division’s core operating profit grew at 5%.
Diagnostics Division. Core operating profit was up by 2% driven by sales growth of 6%. The operating profit was negatively impacted
by the base effect of the pension plan changes in 2013. There was also a negative impact on cost of sales development from the base
effect of a VAT refund of 45 million Swiss francs in 2013. Excluding these factors core operating profit grew by 8%, ahead of sales, due
to contained marketing and distribution and research and development costs. The Division has continued the implementation of global
restructuring plans in the Diabetes Care business and has also continued the implementation of various IT projects.
6 | Roche Finance Report 2014Financial Review | Roche Group
Mergers and acquisitions
During 2014 the Roche Group completed the acquisition of several companies. The total cost of the acquired assets was 9.9 billion Swiss
francs in cash and 0.7 billion Swiss francs from the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements.
On 29 September 2014 the Pharmaceuticals Division acquired a 100% controlling interest in InterMune for 8.8 billion Swiss francs.
The acquisition adds a new medicine for idiopathic lung fibrosis, Esbriet, to the Roche portfolio. Esbriet sales of 44 million Swiss francs
were recorded in the three months following the InterMune acquisition. There was a net negative impact of 72 million Swiss francs on
the 2014 core operating profit due to the post-acquisition operating expenses for InterMune, notably for Esbriet launch costs. The Group
issued 5.75 billion US dollars of debt to finance the transaction.
The Pharmaceuticals Division also completed the acquisitions of Seragon Pharmaceuticals and Santaris Pharma. In Diagnostics the
Division completed the acquisitions of Genia Technologies and Bina Technologies in the sequencing business and IQuum in the Molecular
Diagnostics business. The Ariosa Diagnostics acquisition closed in January 2015 and the Trophos acquisition is expected to close in the
first quarter of 2015. The transaction with Foundation Medicine is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015.
Further details are given in Notes 5 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Global restructuring plans
During 2014 the Group continued with the implementation of several major global restructuring plans initiated in prior years, notably
the programme to address the long-term profitability in the Diabetes Care businesses in the Diagnostics Division. Total costs in 2014
of 794 million Swiss francs were considerably higher than the 2013 costs, which totalled 163 million Swiss francs. This is due to the
2013 results including an income of 531 million Swiss francs from the reversal of previously incurred impairment charges for a bulk drug
production unit at the Vacaville site in California.

2) Includes closure of the Nutley site and associated infrastructure and environmental remediation costs.
3) Includes plans for Pharmaceuticals Division research and development strategic realignment, InterMune integration and Specialty Care field force in Europe.
Diagnostics Division. On 26 September 2013 Roche Diabetes Care announced the ‘Autonomy and Speed’ initiative which will enable
the business to focus on Diabetes Care specific requirements, speed up processes and decision-making and drive efficiencies. In 2014
total costs of 118 million Swiss francs were incurred, mainly for employee-related costs and IT and consultancy costs. Spending on other
smaller plans within the Division was 128 million Swiss francs, and included costs related to IT projects and the restructuring of the
former Applied Science business.
Site consolidation. The operational closure of the US site in Nutley, New Jersey, was completed on schedule by the end of 2013 and
the Group is currently in the process of divesting the site. Work on remediating the Nutley site is continuing, but no significant additional
restructuring expenses were incurred in 2014. Other site consolidation costs include those related to the closure of Toluca, Mexico
(Pharmaceuticals) and Graz, Austria (Diagnostics) sites.
Roche Finance Report 2014 | 7Roche Group | Financial Review
Other global restructuring plans. Total costs were 436 million Swiss francs, with one major item being an impairment of the goodwill
arising from Marcadia acquisition of 139 million Swiss francs following the exit from cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Other
significant costs included 121 million Swiss francs relating to field force reductions across Europe in the Pharmaceuticals Division’s
Specialty Care unit. InterMune integration costs were 79 million Swiss francs and costs of 46 million Swiss francs arose from the
implementation of the global outsourcing of clinical trial monitoring in the Pharmaceuticals Division. The remaining minor plans totalled
51 million Swiss francs.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Total impairment charges recorded against goodwill and intangible assets in 2014 were 1,908 million Swiss francs, compared to 650 million
Swiss francs in 2013. The major part of this was in the Tissue Diagnostics business with impairment charges of 552 million Swiss francs
against goodwill and 643 million Swiss francs against product intangible assets. The impairment of product intangible assets represents the
reassessment of a late-stage product development which has been returned to a pre-design phase to demonstrate feasibility and quality
improvement. The impairment of goodwill reflects the decrease in the forecasted cash flows following this reassessment, combined with
reduced revenue expectations in the US following additional reimbursement cuts and a change in the discount rate used for the impairment
testing.
As mentioned above there was goodwill impairment in the Pharmaceuticals Division of 139 million Swiss francs included in global
restructuring plans. In addition to this the Pharmaceuticals Division also recorded goodwill impairment charges of 183 million Swiss
francs related to certain other previous acquisitions. There were also other impairment charges in both divisions totalling 391 million
Swiss francs, resulting mainly from decisions to stop development on various compounds. Further details are given in Notes 8 and 9
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
As disclosed in the financial report in 2013, there was a base effect in operating income of 302 million Swiss francs in 2013 for past
service costs from changes to the Group’s pension plans in Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Germany. Of this amount, 131 million
Swiss francs were recorded in the Pharmaceuticals Division and 67 million Swiss francs in the Diagnostics Division. The remaining
104 million Swiss francs of income were allocated to Corporate, mainly attributable to previously divested businesses. Further details
are given in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Legal and environmental settlements
On 5 March 2014 the Italian Antitrust Authority (‘AGCM’) issued a verdict that alleges that Roche and Novartis colluded to artificially
differentiate Avastin and Lucentis in order to foster the sales of Lucentis in Italy. The AGCM fined Roche with 90.5 million euros and
Novartis with 92 million euros. On 2 December 2014 the Administrative Tribunal of Lazio upheld the decision by the AGCM. Roche
strongly disagrees with the verdict and will appeal. In July 2014 Roche paid the fine under protest to avoid additional penalty fees prior
to the appeal hearing and recorded a provision for this amount in the Consolidated Financial Statements and a corresponding expense
of 110 million Swiss francs within general and administration. The fine and related interest will be reimbursed if Roche wins the case.
Further details are given in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Major debt restructuring
As a result of low interest rates on capital markets the Group decided in November 2014 to restructure part of its debt. This consisted
of the refinancing of 1 billion US dollars of notes with coupons of 5.25%–7.00% originally due in 2035–2039 with the issuance of 1 billion
US dollars of notes due in 2024 and 2044 with coupons of 3.35%–4.00%. This major debt restructuring resulted in a loss on repurchase
of 429 million Swiss francs. Further details are given in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Treasury and taxation
Core financing costs were 1.4 billion Swiss francs, a decrease of 12% at constant exchange rates, with interest expenses and
amortisation of debt discounts and issue costs being 10% lower as debt was repaid. Other financial income included 330 million Swiss
francs of income from equity securities, notably a gain of 239 million Swiss francs from the sale of an equity security position in late 2014.
Core tax expenses increased by 12% to 4.0 billion Swiss francs and the Group’s effective core tax rate increased to 24.1% compared
to 22.7% in 2013. This was mainly due to the higher percentage of core profit contribution coming from tax jurisdictions with relatively
higher local tax rates than the average Group tax rate, notably in the US. In addition the effective tax rate in 2013 was favourably
impacted by the retrospective re-enactment of the 2012 US research and development tax credits in January 2013, which means that
the 2013 results included two years of these credits in respect of 2012 and 2013.
Net income and earnings per share
Net income and diluted EPS decreased respectively by 10% and 11% at constant exchange rates driven by the costs of the Group’s
restructuring activities of 0.7 billion Swiss francs and impairment charges of 1.9 billion Swiss francs, combined with a base effect of income
of 0.5 billion Swiss francs from the reversal of impairment charges in the 2013 results.
In contrast core net income and Core EPS increased respectively by 6% and 5%. The core basis excludes non-core items such as global
restructuring costs, amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and loss on major debt restructuring. Excluding the
impact of the double charge of 202 million Swiss francs related to the US Branded Prescription Drug fee, underlying earnings grew at 7%.
Supplementary net income and EPS information is given on pages 132 to 135. This includes calculations of core EPS and reconciles
the core results to the Group’s published IFRS results.

Compared to the start of 2014 the Swiss franc strengthened against the Japanese yen, the Russian rouble and the euro resulting overall
in a negative translation impact by the end of 2014 on balance sheet positions at a Group level. The weakening of the Swiss franc
against the US dollar during the year led to a positive translation impact on the net operating assets, which was offset at Group level by
the natural hedge from the Group’s US dollar-denominated debt. The exchange rates used are given on pages 29 to 30. The impacts of
changes in exchange rates after 31 December 2014 are not reflected in these numbers. See also Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Roche Finance Report 2014 | 9Roche Group | Financial Review
In the Pharmaceuticals Division net working capital increased by 7% at constant exchange rates. Trade receivables decreased despite
higher sales with strong collections, forfaiting activities and decreased payment terms. In addition to the inventory fair value adjustment
resulting from the InterMune acquisition, underlying inventory levels increased to ensure patient supply given increasing demand for
established products in expanding markets in addition to new approvals for recently launched products such as the Actemra/RoActemra
subcutaneous formulation and Kadcyla. Trade payables increased as a result of improving payment terms with suppliers. Long-term
net operating assets increased significantly due to the goodwill and intangible assets of 11.1 billion Swiss francs from the InterMune
and other acquisitions. Property, plant and equipment also increased due to site development projects and manufacturing facilities.
In Diagnostics the decrease in net working capital of 1% was driven by an increase in other payables and accrued liabilities, higher trade
payables, only partially offset by higher inventories due to higher demand in emerging markets. Trade receivables increased by 3% driven
by stronger sales, partially offset by improved collections in the Southern European countries. Long-term net operating assets decreased
by 3%, as the impairments in the Tissue Diagnostics business more than offset the increase in goodwill and intangible assets from the
Genia, Bina and IQuum acquisitions.
The increase in net debt was driven by the cash outflow for the acquisition of InterMune. The net pension liabilities increased by
2.9 billion Swiss francs due to lower interest rates during 2014 increasing the discounted defined benefit obligation at year-end. The net
tax position decreased mainly due to the deferred tax effects from the acquisition accounting and increased net pension liabilities.

The Group’s operating free cash flow for 2014 was 15.8 billion Swiss francs, a decrease of 2%. The 3% increase in core operating profit
was offset by higher capital expenditure, increased inventories and higher restructuring costs. The free cash flow increased by 1%
at constant exchange rates to 5.3 billion Swiss francs, driven by sales of equity securities and lower interest payments and lower tax
payments which more than offset the higher annual dividend payments.

Pharmaceuticals Division sales increased by 4% at constant exchange rates, with growth driven by the oncology portfolio, especially
the HER2 breast cancer franchise. Sales growth was driven mainly by the following key products: Perjeta, Herceptin, Avastin, Kadcyla,
Actemra/RoActemra and MabThera/Rituxan. These products represent 61% of the portfolio (2013: 58%) and together contributed
2.1 billion Swiss francs at constant exchange rates to sales growth in 2014. Sales of Xeloda were 46% lower as it is now off-patent in
key markets and subject to generic competition while Pegasys sales were 20% lower due to increased competition. Xolair grew at 25%
while Tamiflu sales increased 54% mainly due to a severe influenza season in the US. Sales of Valcyte/Cymevene continued to grow
as the expected entry of generic competition was delayed.
Roche Finance Report 2014 | 11Roche Group | Financial Review
In oncology the HER2 franchise benefited from continued strong demand for Perjeta in the US and Europe and the increased use
in combination with Herceptin was also one of the growth drivers for Herceptin. Uptake of Kadcyla was also very strong in the US and
Europe. Avastin showed strong growth across all regions with strong demand for key indications and with several new approvals.
MabThera/Rituxan grew strongly in the Europe region. Sales in immunology increased due to strong demand in all regions for Actemra/
RoActemra as monotherapy in rheumatoid arthritis. There was growth in ophthalmology as Lucentis sales in the US increased largely
due to higher adoption in treating diabetic macular edema (DME).

MabThera/Rituxan. For non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) as well as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Sales growth resulted from
increased use in both oncology and rheumatoid arthritis indications. Sales in the oncology franchise were stable due to competitor
products while in the RA franchise sales grew by 12% with increased share and shorter dosing intervals. The subcutaneous formulation
of MabThera/Rituxan in NHL is now approved in Europe, Australia, Russia and Chile.

US sales were stable, with the 2013 results benefiting from the release of sales reserves for the 340B Program. Excluding this base
impact of 99 million Swiss francs, US sales rose by 5%. Sales showed strong growth in Europe (+6%), where sales were driven
by increased market share in both FL and first-line treatment for CLL. Sales also benefited from a decrease in mandatory rebates in
Germany. In International markets sales declined by 1% due to economic conditions in the fourth quarter in Russia.
HER2 franchise (Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla). For HER2-positive breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic (advanced) gastric
cancer. Overall growth in the HER2 franchise was 20%. Herceptin sales were strong and Perjeta and Kadcyla both grew strongly as their
global rollout continues.

Herceptin sales grew in the US by 12%, with the 2013 base results benefiting from the release of sales reserves for the 340B Program.
Excluding this impact of 41 million Swiss francs, US sales rose by 14%. US growth resulted from increased usage in the treatment of breast
cancer in combination with Perjeta. In Europe sales also increased (+3%) with good uptake for the Herceptin subcutaneous formulation
which is now available in many markets. Sales in Japan grew by 1% due to increased usage in combination with Perjeta. The International
region grew in all sub-regions. Growth in Latin America resulted from higher demand in the public sector. Sales in Asia–Pacific grew as
a result of improving patient access. Perjeta sales grew in all regions for treating metastatic breast cancer, most significantly in the US
and Europe, where uptake was strongest in Germany and France. US growth also benefited from use in the pre-surgical setting. Kadcyla
sales grew in all regions with very strong uptake in the US and Europe and in addition good initial uptake in Japan.
Avastin. For advanced colorectal, breast, lung, kidney, cervical and ovarian cancer, and relapsed glioblastoma (a type of brain tumour).

1) Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa.
United States. Sales grew by 6% led by the HER2 franchise (+27%) as well as Tamiflu, Xolair, Avastin and Actemra/RoActemra. The 2013
base results also benefited from the release of sales reserves for the 340B Program. Excluding this impact of 182 million Swiss francs,
US sales rose by 7%. The leading products were the oncology medicines MabThera/Rituxan, Avastin and Herceptin, with sales of 3.3 billion
Swiss francs (+1%), 2.7 billion Swiss francs (+6%) and 2.0 billion Swiss francs (+12%), respectively. In addition Xolair (+25%) and Actemra/
RoActemra (+31%) were significant growth drivers and Tamiflu sales increased (+62%). Xolair sales benefited from the 2014 approval to
treat a form of chronic hives. Growth was negatively impacted by the decline of Xeloda (–70%), which is now off-patent in the US.
Europe. Sales increased by 3% led by the HER2 breast cancer franchise (+18%) and higher demand for MabThera/Rituxan and Avastin.
MabThera/Rituxan sales grew by 6% due to increased market share in follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lower
mandatory rebates. Avastin grew by 3% due to demand in ovarian and breast cancer. In addition there was continued sales growth
of Actemra/RoActemra (+22%) and higher Tamiflu sales due to some pandemic stocking. Growth was partially offset by lower sales
of Xeloda (–70%) due to loss of exclusivity and Pegasys (–33%).
Japan. Sales grew by 7%, with the major growth driver being the HER2 franchise (+33%). There was increased demand for Avastin
(+9%) in breast cancer as well as ovarian cancer and malignant glioma, and also for Actemra/RoActemra (+19%) with significant uptake
of its new subcutaneous form. There was also strong growth in Edirol and Bonviva sales.
International. Sales increased by 2% driven by volume growth in the Latin America sub-region, in particular in Brazil and Argentina.
Growth in Latin America was mainly due to the HER2 franchise (+20%) and the other oncology products, especially Avastin (+15%) and
MabThera/Rituxan (+15%). In Asia–Pacific, the main drivers of the 4% growth were also the HER2 franchise together with MabThera/
Rituxan and Actemra/RoActemra. Sales in China grew by 4% with higher HER2 franchise and MabThera/Rituxan, which offset the decline
in sales of Tarceva and the base effect of strong Tamiflu sales in 2013. For the Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa sub-region, there
were lower sales in Russia as a result of economic conditions in the fourth quarter, and in the Middle East following distribution changes.

Total – IFRS and Core basis 2,273 1,702 +35
The increase of 35% in royalties and other operating income at constant exchange rates was due to higher income from product
disposals. The majority of this income arose from the divestment gain of 428 million Swiss francs from the sale of the filgrastim franchise
rights back to Amgen. Royalty income increased by 9% due to higher sales of Eylea, Lucentis and Humira.

Core cost of sales increased by 4% at constant exchange rates, in line with the growth in sales. Manufacturing cost of goods sold and
period costs increased less than sales. Royalty expenses were slightly higher than 2013 as the impact of higher Tamiflu sales offset the
base impact of the additional back royalty expenses for the Sanofi arbitration. Expenses from collaboration and profit-sharing agreements
increased mainly due to growing sales of Xolair. Non-core costs include the write-off of the inventory fair value adjustment from the
InterMune acquisition accounting in as far as it relates to 2014 sales. The remaining 691 million Swiss francs of this adjustment will be
expensed as the acquired inventory is sold. The comparative global restructuring costs for site consolidation activities include income
of 531 million Swiss francs from the reversal of previously incurred impairment charges from the Vacaville site in California. Amortisation
of intangible assets increased due to Esbriet intangible assets acquired as part of the InterMune acquisition.

Marketing and distribution core costs increased at constant exchange rates by 6% and as a percentage of sales increased to 16.3%
(2013: 16.0%). Marketing efforts supported newly launched products such as Perjeta and Kadcyla, as well as established oncology
products in key markets. The InterMune acquisition led to an increase in costs for the launch of Esbriet. Investments were also made
to enable continued growth in emerging markets and increased patient access to medicines. Bad debt expenses of 71 million Swiss
francs were recorded in 2014 (2013: income of 32 million Swiss francs) as a result of increased credit risk with certain customers in
the International sales region. There was a release to income from allowances in Southern Europe in the comparative period.

Core research and development costs increased by 4% at constant exchange rates and, as a percentage of sales, rose to 21.5%
(2013: 21.2%). There were continued investments in the oncology franchise, notably for the PD-L1-targeted therapy and also alectinib,
which was recently approved in Japan. The neuroscience therapeutic area remained a key area, with programmes for multiple sclerosis
and Alzheimer’s disease, as was the immunology therapeutic area. There was lower spending in cardiovascular and metabolism following
the previously announced reorganisation of the Pharmaceuticals Division’s research and development activities and the termination of
aleglitazar in 2013. In addition the Pharmaceuticals Division invested 398 million Swiss francs on the in-licensing of pipeline compounds
and technologies, which are capitalised as intangible assets. Global restructuring costs of 101 million Swiss francs were recorded,
consisting mainly of employee-related costs resulting from the implementation of an outsourced model for clinical trial monitoring
activities. There were impairment charges of 337 million Swiss francs resulting mainly from decisions to stop development on various
compounds.

General and administration core costs increased by 50% at constant exchange rates and as a percentage of sales increased to 4.3%
from 2.9%. This reflects the base effect of income recorded in 2013 for past service costs from changes in the Group’s pension plans in
Switzerland and the UK of 131 million Swiss francs. The increase in administration costs was mainly a result of the costs of implementing
a global efficiency initiative enhancing procurement processes and related systems. There was a significant increase in business taxes,
including the costs for the US Branded Prescription Drug fee of 435 million Swiss francs (2013: 175 million Swiss francs). In July 2014, the
US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued the final regulations related to this fee which fundamentally changed a key assumption about
the triggering event for liability recognition. As a result there was a one-time double charge with an operating profit impact of 202 million
Swiss francs. Non-core costs include an impairment of the goodwill from the Marcadia acquisition following the exit from cardiovascular
and metabolic diseases and impairments of dedicated goodwill related to certain other previous acquisitions. Alliance and business
combination costs include mainly the transaction fees and related costs for the InterMune and other acquisitions. Legal and environmental
settlements costs of 110 million Swiss francs were recorded in respect of a fine paid to the Italian Antitrust Authority regarding allegations
about Avastin and Lucentis in Italy. Roche strongly disagrees with the allegations and has appealed. See Note 19 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for more details on this matter.

Pharmaceuticals Division total core operating profit and operating profit both include the elimination of 53 million Swiss francs (2013: 157 million Swiss francs) of unrealised inter-
company profits between Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai.
The fall in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen has a negative impact of approximately 10% on the Chugai results when expressed
in Swiss francs. Sales to external customers by Chugai increased by 7% in Japanese yen with the main drivers being the HER2 franchise
and Avastin. Sales of Actemra/RoActemra to Roche Pharmaceuticals were also significantly higher. Chugai’s core operating profit
increased by only 1% due to the impacts of product mix and the Japanese yen depreciation in cost of sales. The operating free cash
flow at Chugai decreased by 29% mainly as a result of an increase in accounts receivable and higher investments in property plant and
equipment at manufacturing and research facilities.

rates for 2013) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2014 transactions include non-cash movements and therefore the movements in
this table are not the same as amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only includes the cash movements). A full consolidated balance sheet is given on page 43 of
the Consolidated Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given above is on page 137.
20 | Roche Finance Report 2014Financial Review | Roche Group
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of 2014 the Swiss franc weakened against the
US dollar leading to a positive translation impact on the net operating assets as at 31 December 2014. There were only minor negative
translation effects from the Swiss franc strengthening against the Japanese yen and the euro. The exchange rates used are given on
pages 29 to 30. The impacts of changes in exchange rates after 31 December 2014 are not reflected in these numbers. See also Note 33
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net working capital. The increase of 7% at constant exchange rates was due to an increase of inventories which offset an increase
in payables and a reduction in trade receivables. Trade receivables decreased, despite higher sales, due to strong collections, forfaiting
of receivables in Italy and shorter payment terms. In February 2014 a payment was received in Spain as part of the Montoro Plan. In
addition to the inventory fair value adjustment from the InterMune acquisition, underlying inventory levels increased to ensure continuity
of supply to patients due to increases in demand for established products, especially in emerging markets. Inventories also increased
due to recently launched products such as the Actemra/RoActemra subcutaneous formulation and Kadcyla. Trade payables increased
as a result of improving payment terms with suppliers.
Long-term net operating assets. These grew significantly due to the increase of goodwill and intangible assets by 11.1 billion Swiss
francs mainly relating to the InterMune and Seragon acquisitions. There were also increases in provisions for contingent consideration,
legal and restructuring provisions and also in property, plant and equipment. Significant investments continue to be made in site
development projects and manufacturing facilities, in particular in Switzerland, the US and China.

The Pharmaceuticals Division’s operating free cash flow was stable at 14.8 billion Swiss francs. The increased cash generation from the
underlying business compensated for the increased investments in property, plant and equipment and increases in net working capital
noted above in the comments on the financial position. Operating profit, net of operating cash adjustments, increased by 1% while core
operating profit increased by 4%. This difference was mainly due to significant non-cash items, including the income from changes to
the Group’s pension plans in 2013.
Increasing capital expenditure in 2014 for property, plant and equipment reflects the significant investments being made in site
development and manufacturing expansion projects, particularly in Switzerland, the US and China.

Sales
The Diagnostics Division continued to increase sales with a growth of 6% at constant exchange rates to 10.8 billion Swiss francs.
Professional Diagnostics, with 8% sales growth, was the main growth contributor led by its immunodiagnostics business. Molecular
Diagnostics sales increased by 6%, with 8% growth in the underlying molecular businesses being partly offset by a decline in the
genome sequencing business. Diabetes Care sales were up 1% despite the continued challenging market environment, notably in the US.
The growth in Tissue Diagnostics was driven by the advanced staining franchise.

Professional Diagnostics. With an increase in sales of 8%, the business area was the major contributor to divisional performance in all
regions, with growth being primarily driven by the immunodiagnostics business (+13%), which now represents 26% of divisional sales.
This growth was supported by the clinical chemistry business (+7%) and by coagulation monitoring (+8%). In 2014 the Elecsys Syphilis
immunoassay and the Anti-Müllerian Hormone test were launched. A new instrument, the cobas 6500, was launched in 2014 for fully
automated urinalysis combining urine strip testing and digital microscopy.

The Professional Diagnostics business is growing in all regions, but especially in Asia–Pacific (+18%) and EMEA (+4%) due to strong
sales in China and Germany. In the North America region strong growth was reported for the clinical chemistry and immunodiagnostic
businesses (both +8%).
Diabetes Care. Sales were up 1% despite continuing challenging market conditions for the blood glucose monitoring portfolio in major
markets like the US. Sales of the premium product Accu-Chek Mobile grew by 19% and Accu-Chek Aviva/Performa sales were up 7%.
The Accu-Chek Insight system, an insulin delivery system combining an insulin pump and a blood glucose meter, and the Accu-Chek
Connect, a web-based blood glucose meter to support Diabetes Care self-management, have been launched in Europe in 2014.

Sales in North America were down by 6% due to the Medicare reimbursement cut in 2013 on strips, lower pump sales in the US and
changes in the number of reimbursed strips in Canada. This was offset by increased sales in the EMEA region (+2%) and the Asia–Pacific
(+7%) and Latin America (+8%) regions, mainly driven by China and Argentina.
Further progress was made in the implementation of specific initiatives that Roche Diabetes Care initiated in 2013 with the goal to
streamline processes and decision-making and to drive efficiencies while continuing to develop innovative solutions.
Molecular Diagnostics. Sales grew 6%, and in the underlying molecular business by 8%, with the major contributions coming from
the Virology portfolio (+7%) and the HPV assay (+48%). This was partly offset by a sales decline in the genome sequencing business.

Regionally, growth was driven by North America (+10%). In 2014 the cobas 6800/8800 systems, two integrated and fully automated
molecular testing systems, were launched with blood screening and virology assays. Also in 2014 authorities in Australia, Canada and
the US approved the cobas HPV test for first-line primary screening for cervical cancer. A further three diagnostics tests (MRSA/SA,
C-difficile and HSV) were launched in CE-marked countries which expand the menu of the cobas 4800.
In 2014 Roche Molecular Diagnostics acquired Genia Technologies, which is developing a single-molecule, semiconductor-based
DNA-sequencing platform using nanopore technology, Bina Technologies, which is developing and commercialising Bina-GMS
to support multiple sequencing technologies and IQuum, which is focused on developing point-of-care products for the molecular
diagnostics market.
Roche Finance Report 2014 | 23Roche Group | Financial Review
Following the reorganisation of the former Applied Science business area the real-time PCR technology, the NAP (nucleic acid
purification) portfolio and biochemical reagents are now part of the Molecular Diagnostics business. The sales of the sequencing
business are reported as part of the results for Molecular Diagnostics.
Tissue Diagnostics. Sales rose 10%, driven by 9% growth in the advanced staining portfolio. The CINtec franchise for cervical cancer
diagnosis grew by 18% showing a continued good uptake.

Regionally, growth was driven by EMEA (+17%) and North America (+6%) despite reimbursement changes in the US. In both regions
the growth was driven by the advanced staining portfolio. Sales in Asia–Pacific grew by 24% with China as the main market. Revenues
from existing external partnerships showed continued growth.
Impairments of 552 million Swiss francs to goodwill and 643 million Swiss francs to product intangible assets were recorded in Tissue
Diagnostics. The factors leading to these impairments were the return of a late-stage product development project to a pre-design
phase. This led to a decrease in the forecasted cash flows which, combined with reduced revenue expectations in the US following
additional reimbursement cuts and a change in the discount rate, resulted in these impairments.

Diagnostics. The sales increase in Asia–Pacific was driven by a strong performance in China (+23%) due to governmental healthcare
investments, public demand and the Division’s expanding presence and wide portfolio. In the EMEA region, the Division’s largest market,
sales increased by 4% led by growth in Professional Diagnostics. In the Latin America region sales increased 13% driven mainly by
growth in Professional Diagnostics and Diabetes Care. Sales in Japan remained stable.

Core cost of sales increased by 9% at constant exchange rates primarily due to an increase in manufacturing cost of goods sold and
period costs as a result of volume growth. Additionally period costs in 2013 included a one-time VAT refund of 45 million Swiss francs
related to meter placements. The cost of sales ratio was 44.4% compared to 43.3% in 2013. Global restructuring costs were incurred
mainly due to the reorganisation of the Diabetes Care business in the course of the Autonomy and Speed Project, reorganisation of
the former Applied Science business and the closure of the site in Graz, Austria. Amortisation of product intangibles decreased as some
intangible assets became fully amortised. In addition, product intangible asset impairment charges of 225 million Swiss francs were
incurred in Tissue Diagnostics and Diabetes Care.

Marketing and distribution core costs were up 4% at constant exchange rates, reflecting higher spending in Professional Diagnostics
driven by marketing support and sales force expenses, partially offset by lower bad debt expenses. In North America marketing and
distribution costs decreased significantly due to lower field force expenses. This decrease was more than offset by higher expenses in
the Asia–Pacific and Latin America regions to further penetrate emerging markets. On a core basis, marketing and distribution costs as
a percentage of sales were 22.9% compared to 23.3% in 2013. Global restructuring costs were mainly due to initiatives to improve the
efficiency of marketing and distribution activities within the reorganisations of the Diabetes Care and former Applied Science businesses.

automation, coagulation, hematology, and point-of-care. As a percentage of sales, research and development core costs decreased to
9.6% from 9.7% in 2013. Global restructuring costs were mainly due to the closure of the site in Graz, Austria and the reorganisation in
the Applied Science business. There were impairment charges of 472 million Swiss francs in the Tissue Diagnostics business following
the return of a late-stage product development project to a pre-design phase.

General and administration core costs increased by 21% at constant exchange rates due to the base effect of one-time income in 2013
of 67 million Swiss francs recorded for past service costs from changes in the Group’s pension plans in Switzerland. When excluding
this base effect, core costs increased by 5%. Business taxes included costs of 24 million Swiss francs for the Medical Device Excise Tax
in the US. As a percentage of sales, core costs increased to 4.8% from 4.1% in 2013. Global restructuring costs were mainly due to
IT projects and the reorganisation in Diabetes Care. In addition, goodwill impairment charges of 552 million Swiss francs were incurred
in the Tissue Diagnostics business area.

The absolute amount of the movement between the 2014 and 2013 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2014 transactions (translated at average
rates for 2013) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2014 transactions include non-cash movements and therefore the movements in
this table are not the same as amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only include the cash movements). A full consolidated balance sheet is given on page 43 of the
Consolidated Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given above is on page 136.
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of 2014 the Swiss franc weakened against the
US dollar leading to a positive translation impact on the net operating assets as at 31 December 2014. This was partly offset by a negative
translation effect from the Swiss franc strengthening against the euro. The Diagnostics Division does not have a significant net asset
position in Japanese yen so the appreciation of the Swiss franc against the Japanese yen had only a minor impact. The exchange rates
used are given on pages 29 to 30. The impacts of changes in exchange rates after 31 December 2014 are not reflected in these numbers.
See also Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Net working capital. Net trade working capital increased by 2%, driven by an increase in inventories and accounts receivables, only
partially offset by an increase in trade payables. Inventories increased by 8% due to higher demand in emerging markets, notably in
China, Turkey and Brazil. Trade payables increased by 22% as a result of improving payment terms with suppliers. Trade receivables
increased by 3% due to stronger sales that are partially offset by improved collections and factoring initiatives in Southern Europe.
In February 2014 payment was received in Spain as part of the Montoro Plan. The net liability for other receivables/payables increased
due to an increase in payables offsetting VAT receivables.
Long-term net operating assets. The decrease of 3% at constant exchange rates was due to the increase in goodwill and intangible
assets from the Genia, IQuum and Bina acquisitions being more than offset by impairments in the Tissue Diagnostics business. Property,
plant and equipment increased slightly due to site expansion projects in the US and Germany. Provisions increased by 30% due to
the creation of provisions of 274 million Swiss francs for the contingent consideration arrangements in the Genia, IQuum and Bina
acquisitions.

General and administration core costs increased by 21% at constant exchange rates due to the 2013 base effect of income of 104 million
Swiss francs recorded for past service costs from changes in the Group’s pension plans in Switzerland and the UK. Excluding this, costs
decreased by 5% due to reduced IT project expenses. Administration expenses increased by 7% due to higher spending on legal and
other corporate activities. Total costs on an IFRS basis decreased by 8% as there were no legal and environmental settlement expenses
in 2014.
Corporate operating free cash flow showed a lower outflow in 2014 compared to 2013, driven by lower spending on IT.

Comparing average exchange rates in 2014 with average exchange rates during 2013, the Swiss franc was stronger against most
currencies, in particular the US dollar, a number of Latin American currencies and the Japanese yen. The impact is strongly negative
on the income statement and free cash flow results expressed in Swiss francs compared to constant exchange rates. For sales, these
developments resulted in a negative impact of 4 percentage points, equivalent to 1.6 billion Swiss francs when translated into Swiss
francs. The currency translation exposure for the operating profit is mitigated by the Group having the majority of its cost base located
outside of Switzerland. The sensitivity of Group sales and core operating profit in absolute terms to a 1% movement in average foreign
currency exchange rates against the Swiss franc during 2014 is shown in the table below.
On 15 January 2015 the Swiss National Bank (SNB) announced that it was discontinuing the minimum exchange rate of 1.20 Swiss francs
per euro. As a consequence, stock markets in Switzerland fell significantly and the value of the Swiss franc increased dramatically. For the
Roche Group, no fundamental impact is foreseen. For example, the Group incurs less than 20% of its overall costs in Switzerland. By the
same token, key markets such as the US, Europe and Japan have complete value chains, meaning that costs are incurred in local currencies,
not in Swiss francs. The impacts of changes in exchange rates after 31 December 2014 are not reflected in these numbers. See also Note
33 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Since the Group uses the Swiss franc as the presentation currency in its consolidated
financial statements, then a weakening of foreign currencies against the Swiss franc will have a negative currency translation impact on
the Group’s consolidated results when reported in Swiss francs. The currency translation sensitivity of the Group’s results to movements
in foreign currency exchange rates is shown below.

The Group’s revenues are primarily generated from sales of products to customers. Such revenues are mainly received in the local
currency of the customer’s home market, although in certain emerging markets invoicing is made in major international currencies such
as the US dollar and euro. The costs of sales and marketing and also some administration costs follow the same currency pattern as
sales. The majority of research and development activities are incurred at the Group’s global research facilities, and therefore the costs
are mainly concentrated in US dollars, Swiss francs and euros. General and administration costs tend to be incurred mainly at central
locations in the US, Switzerland and Germany. Obviously the large majority of Chugai’s costs are denominated in Japanese yen.

Financing costs
Financing costs on an IFRS basis were 18% higher at constant exchange rates, mainly due to a loss from a major debt restructuring
of 429 million Swiss francs. Core financing costs were 12% lower driven by a decrease of 10% in interest expenses which reflects
the continued repayment of the debt incurred to finance the Genentech transaction. The new debt issued in late 2014 to finance the
InterMune acquisition did not have a major impact on financing costs. The net interest cost of defined benefit pension plans during 2014
decreased by 11% to 201 million Swiss francs due to the improved funding status at the end of 2013. A full analysis of financing costs is
given in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Roche Finance Report 2014 | 31Roche Group | Financial Review
Other financial income (expense)
Other financial income (expense) was a net income of 246 million Swiss francs compared to an expense of 119 million Swiss francs in
2013. The reason for this was income from equity securities, which was 330 million Swiss francs in 2014 as against 42 million Swiss francs
in 2013, with the major factor being the sale of an equity security position in late 2014 resulting in income of 239 million Swiss francs.
Interest income and income from debt securities were 39 million Swiss francs in an environment of continuing low interest rates. The net
foreign exchange result reflects hedging costs and was a loss of 105 million Swiss francs compared to a loss of 174 million Swiss francs
in 2013. A full analysis of other financial income (expense) is given in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and details of the
Group’s hedging arrangement are given in Note 29.
Income taxes
The Group’s effective core tax rate increased by 1.4 percentage points to 24.1% in 2014 (2013: 22.7%). This was mainly due to the higher
percentage of core profit contribution coming from tax jurisdictions with relatively higher local tax rates than the average Group tax rate,
notably in the US. In addition the effective tax rate in 2013 includes the retrospective re-enactment of the US research and development
tax credits for 2012, which means that the 2013 results included two years of these tax credits in respect of 2012 as well as 2013.
The IFRS results include non-core expenses coming from tax jurisdictions with relatively higher tax rates than the Group’s effective tax
rate, therefore decreasing the effective tax rate in the IFRS results compared to the core results. This impact was partially offset by
the fact that the IFRS results also include goodwill impairments that are not tax deductible. Full details of the Group’s income tax positions
are given in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financial position
The increase in net debt was mainly due to outflows on business combinations of 9.6 billion Swiss francs partially offset by the free
cash flow of 5.3 billion Swiss francs. The increase in net pension liabilities reflects lower interest rates leading to the discounted defined
benefit obligation being higher. The net tax position decreased mainly due to the deferred tax effects from the acquisition accounting
and increased net pension liabilities. At 31 December 2014 the Group held financial long-term assets with a market value of 0.4 billion
Swiss francs, which consist mostly of holdings in biotechnology companies which were acquired in the context of licensing transactions
or scientific collaborations. The weakening of the Swiss franc against the US dollar during the year led to a translation impact from
the Group’s US dollar-denominated debt that increased net debt in Swiss franc terms. The impacts of changes in exchange rates after
31 December 2014 are not reflected in these numbers. See also Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Free cash flow
Sales of equity securities and lower interest payments led to a decrease in the cash outflow from treasury activities, which was 0.8 billion
Swiss francs. Taxes paid were 3.0 billion Swiss francs, a decrease of 9% at constant exchange rates mainly due to prepayments of tax
in 2013. Dividends payments were 6.7 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 0.4 billion Swiss francs compared to 2013, reflecting the 6%
increase of the Roche Group dividend.

Operating free cash flow was 15.8 billion Swiss francs. The strong underlying cash generation of the business was in part used for
capital expenditure projects and restructuring initiatives, resulting in a decrease of 2% at constant exchange rates. Net working capital
increased, notably for inventories.
The cash outflow from treasury activities was lower at 0.8 billion Swiss francs mostly due to sales of equity securities and reduced
interest payments. Total taxes paid were 3.0 billion Swiss francs, a decrease due to prepayments of tax in 2013. Total dividends paid were
higher due to the 6% increase of the annual Roche Group dividend.
Free cash flow of 5.3 billion Swiss francs was 1% higher at constant exchange rates, as sales of equity securities and lower interest and
tax payments more than offset the increase in the dividend.

1) US dollar-denominated debt includes those bonds and notes denominated in euros, Swiss francs and pounds sterling that were swapped into US dollars, and therefore in
the financial statements have economic characteristics equivalent to US dollar-denominated bonds and notes.
The net debt position of the Group at 31 December 2014 was 14.0 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 7.3 billion Swiss francs from
31 December 2013. The increase in net debt was mainly due to 9.6 billion Swiss francs outflow on business combinations, partially offset
by the free cash flow of 5.3 billion Swiss francs which includes the annual dividend payment of 6.7 billion Swiss francs. Transactions in
own equity to hedge the Group’s employee stock option programmes totalled 0.8 billion Swiss francs.
In 2009 the Group entered into derivative contracts with third parties to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from bonds and notes
issued in currencies other than US dollar. At the same time collateral agreements were entered with the derivative counterparties to
mitigate counterparty risk. During 2014, the cash collateral balance decreased by 0.6 billion Swiss francs. The collateral balance in relation
to the hedges on the non-US dollar-denominated bonds and notes is mainly sensitive to the foreign exchange rate between the US dollar
and the euro, but also to pound sterling. Currently the collateral balance moves by approximately 45 million US dollars if all of these foreign
exchange rates move by 1% simultaneously.
The redemption and repurchase of bonds and notes during 2014 (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) had an impact
on liquid funds, but had no impact on the net debt position.

Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate
fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. In 2014
expenses for the Group’s defined contribution plans were 364 million Swiss francs (2013: 343 million Swiss francs). All other plans are
classified as ‘defined benefit plans’, even if the Group’s potential obligation is minor or has a relatively remote possibility of arising. Plans
are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by payments from the Group and by employees, but in some
cases the plan is unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources.
Defined benefit plans
Expenses for the Group’s defined benefit plans were 586 million Swiss francs (2013: 329 million Swiss francs). The increase was mainly
due to the base effect of past service income of 302 million Swiss francs in 2013. This was partly offset by a decrease in the current
service cost of 42 million Swiss francs driven by higher discount rates at the beginning of 2014 compared to the beginning of 2013.
Based on the revised actuarial assumptions at the end of 2014, expenses for the Group’s defined benefit plans in 2015 are expected to
be approximately 704 million Swiss francs driven by lower discount rates at the beginning of 2015. These estimates for 2015 pension
expenses do not include any settlement or past service/curtailment effects that might arise during the year.
During 2013 operating income of 302 million Swiss francs was recorded for past service costs from changes to the Group’s pension
plans in Switzerland, the UK and Germany. This represents the one-time impact of the adjustment of the pension liability for the plan
changes. Of this amount, 131 million Swiss francs were recorded in the Pharmaceuticals Division and 67 million Swiss francs in the
Diagnostics Division. The remaining 104 million Swiss francs of income were allocated to Corporate, mainly attributable to previously
divested businesses.

Overall the funding status on an IFRS basis of the Group’s defined benefit plans decreased to 80% compared to 88% at the start of the year.
This change came mainly from an increase in the defined benefit obligation arising from a fall in discount rates in Germany, Switzerland
and the US since the end of 2013. The use of updated mortality tables in the US increased the defined benefit obligation by 332 million
Swiss francs. Plan assets increased, mainly due to increases in the market values of investments during 2014. The funded status of the
pension funds is monitored by the local pension fund governance bodies as well as being closely reviewed at a Group level.
Full details of the Group’s pensions and other post-employment benefits are given in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In 2014 Roche ranked number 12 among a peer group consisting of Roche and 15 other healthcare companies 1) for Total Shareholder
Return (TSR), defined as share price growth plus dividends, measured in Swiss francs at actual exchange rates. At constant exchange
rates Roche ranked number 12, with the year-end return being 11% for Roche shares and 12% for Roche non-voting equity securities.
The combined performance of share and non-voting equity security was 12% compared to a weighted average return for the peer group
of 26% in Swiss franc terms and 19% at constant exchange rates.
The healthcare sector outperformed major segments of the general market in 2014 despite continued pricing pressure and government
budget constraints in many parts of the world. Roche shares performed strongly throughout the year until the announcement of the
MARIANNE trial results in late December which affected the closing value.

Proposed dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing an increase of 3% in the dividend for 2014 to 8.00 Swiss francs per share and non-voting equity
security (2013: 7.80 Swiss francs) for approval at the Annual General Meeting. This is the 28th consecutive increase in the dividend. If
the dividend proposal is approved by shareholders, dividend payments on the total shares and non-voting equity securities will amount
to 6.9 billion Swiss francs (2013: 6.7 billion Swiss francs), resulting in a pay-out ratio (based on core net income) of 56.0% (2013: 54.7%).
Based on the prices at year-end 2014, the dividend yield on the Roche share was 3.0% (2013: 3.2%) and the yield on the non-voting
equity security was 3.0% (2013: 3.1%). Further information on the Roche securities is given on pages 138 to 139.

Debt
To finance the Genentech transaction in 2009, the Group issued bonds and notes equivalent to 48.2 billion Swiss francs. Of the debt
raised in early 2009, 74% had been repaid by 31 December 2014. During 2014 1.0 billion US dollar-denominated notes were redeemed
following the exercise of an early-call option in December 2013 and a further 0.4 billion pounds sterling and 0.5 billion US dollars of notes
were repurchased/redeemed later in the year. On 19 December 2014 the Group resolved to exercise its option to call for early redemption
of 0.6 billion US dollars of notes that were due 1 March 2019. These notes will be repaid on 26 March 2015.
The Group financed the InterMune acquisition primarily by raising net proceeds of 5.75 billion US dollars through a debt offering as
described in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The remaining financing was achieved from the Group’s own funds and
from issuing commercial paper.
As a result of low interest rates on capital markets the Group decided in November 2014 to restructure part of its debt. This includes
early partial redemptions of 1 billion US dollar-denominated notes originally due 1 March 2039 and 15 July 2035. These were refinanced
by issuing 1 billion US dollar-denominated notes due on 30 September 2024 and 28 November 2044. This major debt restructuring
resulted in a loss on repurchase of 429 million Swiss francs.
All the above transactions are further as described in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The maturity schedule of the Group’s bonds and notes outstanding at 31 December 2014 is shown in the table below, which includes
those instruments that were already in issue prior to the Genentech transaction.

The Group plans to meet its debt obligations using existing liquid funds as well as cash generated from business operations. In 2014
the free cash flow was 5.3 billion Swiss francs, which included the cash generated from operations, as well as payment of interest,
tax and dividends.
For short-term financing requirements, the Group has a commercial paper programme in the US under which it can issue up to 7.5 billion
US dollars of unsecured commercial paper notes and committed credit lines of 3.9 billion euros available as back-stop lines. Commercial
paper notes totalling 3.4 billion US dollars were outstanding as of 31 December 2014 (31 December 2013: 0.8 billion US dollars).
For longer-term financing the Group maintains strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA by Standard & Poor’s and A1
by Moody’s which should facilitate efficient access to international capital markets.

Financial risks
At 31 December 2014 the Group has a net debt position of 14.0 billion Swiss francs (2013: 6.7 billion Swiss francs). The financial assets
of the Group are managed in a conservative way with the objective to meet the Group’s financial obligations at all times.
Asset allocation. A considerable portion of the cash and marketable securities the Group currently holds is being used for debt
redemptions. Liquid funds are either held as cash or are invested in high-quality, investment-grade fixed income securities with an
investment horizon to meet those liquidity requirements.

Credit risk. Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations causing financial
losses for the Group. The rating profile of the Group’s 10.7 billion Swiss francs of cash and fixed income marketable securities remained
strong with 96% being invested in the A-AAA range. As noted previously the Group has signed netting and collateral agreements with
the counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty risk on derivative positions.
The Group has trade receivables of 9.7 billion Swiss francs. Since the beginning of 2010 there have been increasing financial difficulties
in Southern European countries, notably Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. The Group is a leading supplier to the healthcare sectors
in these countries and at 31 December 2014 has trade receivables of 0.7 billion euros (0.9 billion Swiss francs) with public customers in
these countries. This is a decrease of 0.4 billion euros from 31 December 2013, which is mainly due to forfaiting in Italy and collections
in Spain as part of the Montoro Plan. The Group uses different measures to improve collections in these countries, including intense
communication with customers, forfaiting, negotiations of payment plans, charging of interest for late payments, and legal actions.
The Group is applying new commercial policies with some selected hospitals in Greece, Portugal and Italy. Since 2011 the Group’s trade
receivables balance in Southern Europe has decreased by 52%.
Liquidity risk. Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time.
The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements at any
point in time. In addition to the current liquidity position, the Group has strong cash generation ability. Those future cash flows will be
used to repay debt instruments in the coming years.
Roche enjoys strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA by Standard & Poor’s and A1 by Moody’s. At the same time Roche
is rated at the highest available short-term ratings by those agencies. In the event of financing requirements, the ratings and the strong
credit of Roche should permit efficient access to international capital markets, including the commercial paper market. The Group has
committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling 5.0 billion Swiss francs of which 4.7 billion Swiss francs serve as back-
stop line for the commercial paper programme. As at 31 December 2014 no debt has been drawn under these credit lines.
Market risk. Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities. The exposures are
predominantly related to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to
assess the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. VaR data indicates the value range within which a given financial instrument
will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices. The Group’s VaR remained largely stable during 2014.
Interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could affect the Group financial result or the value of
the Group equity. The Group may use interest rate derivatives to manage its interest-rate-related exposure and financial result.
Further information on financial risk management and financial risks and the VaR methodology is included in Note 29 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
International Financial Reporting Standards
The Roche Group has been using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to report its consolidated results since 1990. In 2014
the Group has implemented various minor amendments to existing standards and interpretations, which have no material impact on the
Group’s overall results and financial position.
The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of the various new and revised standards and interpretations that will be
mandatory from 1 January 2015 which the Group has not yet applied. Based on the analysis to date, the Group does not anticipate that
these will have a material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position. The Group is also assessing other new and revised
standards which are not mandatory until after 2015, notably IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ and IFRS 15 ‘Revenues from Contracts with
Customers’.

Notes to the Roche Group
Consolidated Financial Statements
1. General accounting principles
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements (hereafter ‘the Annual Financial Statements’) of the Roche Group have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. They have been prepared using the
historical cost convention except for items that are required to be accounted for at fair value. They were approved for issue by the Board
of Directors on 26 January 2015 and are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on 3 March 2015.
These financial statements are the Annual Financial Statements of Roche Holding Ltd, a company registered in Switzerland,
and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’).
The Group’s significant accounting policies and changes in accounting policies are disclosed in Note 32.
Key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Annual Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingent amounts. Actual outcomes could differ from those
management estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical
experience and various other factors. Revisions to estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. The following
are considered to be the key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions made and are believed to be appropriate based upon
currently available information.
Revenue. The nature of the Group’s business is such that many sales transactions do not have a simple structure and may consist
of multiple components occurring at different times. The Group is also party to out-licensing agreements which involve upfront and
milestone payments occurring over several years and which may also involve certain future obligations. Revenue is only recognised
when, in management’s judgement, the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred and when the Group does not
retain continuing managerial involvement or effective control over the goods sold or when the obligation has been fulfilled. For some
transactions this can result in cash receipts being initially recognised as deferred income and then released to income over subsequent
periods on the basis of the performance of the conditions specified in the agreement. There may be circumstances such that the level of
sales returns, and hence revenues, cannot be reliably measured. In such cases sales are only recognised when the right of return expires,
which is generally upon prescription of the products to patients. In order to estimate this, management uses publicly available information
about prescriptions as well as information provided by wholesalers and other intermediaries.
At 31 December 2014 the Group has 2,309 million Swiss francs in provisions and accruals for expected sales returns, charge-backs
and other rebates, including Medicaid in the US and similar rebates in other countries. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing
contractual or legislatively mandated obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience. At 31 December 2014 the Group has
625 million Swiss francs of provisions for doubtful receivables (see Note 11). Such estimates are based on analyses of ageing of customer
balances, specific credit circumstances, historical trends and the Group’s experience, taking also into account current economic
conditions.
Business combinations. The Group initially recognises the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non-
controlling interest and the consideration transferred in a business combination. Management judgement is particularly involved in the
recognition and fair value measurement of intellectual property, inventories, contingent liabilities and contingent consideration. In making
this assessment management considers the underlying economic substance of the items concerned in addition to the contractual terms.

Impairment. At 31 December 2014 the Group had 17,195 million Swiss francs in property, plant and equipment (see Note 7), 9,949 million
Swiss francs in goodwill (see Note 8) and 12,881 million Swiss francs in intangible assets (see Note 9). Goodwill and intangible assets
not yet available for use are reviewed annually for impairment. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in use are assessed
for impairment when there is a triggering event that provides evidence that an asset may be impaired. To assess whether any impairment
exists estimates of expected future cash flows are used. Actual outcomes could vary significantly from such estimates. Factors such
as changes in discount rates, the planned use of buildings, machinery or equipment or closure of facilities, the presence of competition,
technical obsolescence and lower than anticipated product sales could lead to shorter useful lives or impairment.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits. The Group operates a number of defined benefit plans and the fair values of the
recognised plan assets and liabilities are based upon statistical and actuarial calculations. The measurement of the net defined benefit
obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate, inflation rate, expected mortality and medical cost trend rate assumptions.
At 31 December 2014 the present value of the Group’s defined benefit obligation is 20,915 million Swiss francs (see Note 25). The actuarial
assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changes in market and economic conditions, longer or shorter life spans
of participants, and other changes in the factors being assessed. These differences could impact on the defined benefit plan assets and
liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Legal provisions. The Group provides for anticipated legal settlement costs when there is a probable outflow of resources that can be
reliably estimated. At 31 December 2014 the Group had 677 million Swiss francs in legal provisions. The status of significant legal cases
is disclosed in Note 19. These estimates consider the specific circumstances of each legal case, relevant legal advice and are inherently
judgemental due to the highly complex nature of legal cases. The estimates could change substantially over time as new facts emerge
and each legal case progresses. Where no reliable estimate can be made, no provision is recorded and contingent liabilities are disclosed
where material.
Environmental provisions. The Group provides for anticipated environmental remediation costs when there is a probable outflow of
resources that can be reasonably estimated. At 31 December 2014 the Group had 627 million Swiss francs in environmental provisions
(see Note 19). Environmental provisions consist primarily of costs to fully clean and refurbish contaminated sites, including landfills,
and to treat and contain contamination at certain other sites. These estimates are inherently judgemental due to uncertainties related to
the detection of previously unknown contamination, the method and extent of remediation, the percentage of the problematic materials
attributable to the Group at the remediation sites, and the financial capabilities of other potentially responsible parties. The estimates
could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each environmental remediation progresses.
Contingent consideration provisions. The Group makes provision for the estimated fair value of contingent consideration arrangements
arising from business combinations. At 31 December 2014 the Group had 815 million Swiss francs in contingent consideration provisions
(see Note 19) and the total payments under contingent consideration arrangements could be up to 2,203 million Swiss francs (see Note 29).
The estimated amounts provided are the expected payments, determined by considering the possible scenarios of forecast sales and
other performance criteria, the amount to be paid under each scenario, and the probability of each scenario, which is then discounted to
a net present value. The estimates could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each scenario develops.
Income taxes. At 31 December 2014 the Group had a current income tax net liability of 2,372 million Swiss francs and a deferred tax
net asset of 2,224 million Swiss francs (see Note 4). Significant estimates are required to determine the current and deferred tax assets
and liabilities. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Factors that may impact on
current and deferred taxes include changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations,
future levels of research and development spending and changes in pre-tax earnings.
Leases. The treatment of leasing transactions is mainly determined by whether the lease is considered to be an operating or finance lease.
In making this assessment, management looks at the substance of the lease, as well as the legal form, and makes a judgement about
whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Arrangements which do not take the legal form of a lease
but that nevertheless convey the right to use an asset are also covered by such assessments.
Consolidation. The Group periodically undertakes transactions that may involve obtaining control or significant influence of other
companies. These transactions include equity acquisitions, asset purchases, alliance agreements and other transactions with structured
entities. In all such cases management makes an assessment as to whether the Group has control or significant influence of the other
company, and whether it should be consolidated as a subsidiary or accounted for as an associated company. In making this assessment
management considers the underlying economic substance of the transaction in addition to the contractual terms.

2. Operating segment information
The Group has two Divisions, Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. Revenues are primarily generated from the sale of prescription
pharmaceutical products and diagnostic instruments, reagents and consumables, respectively. Both Divisions also derive revenues from
the sale or licensing of products or technology to third parties. Residual operating activities from divested businesses and certain global
activities are reported as ‘Corporate’. These include the Corporate Executive Committee and global group functions for communications,
human resources, finance (including treasury, taxes and pension fund management), legal, safety and environmental services. Sub-
divisional information for Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai, operating segments within the Pharmaceuticals Division, is also presented.

Since the Group operates internationally, it is subject to income taxes in many different tax jurisdictions. The Group calculates its average
expected tax rate as a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates. This rate changes from year
to year due to changes in the mix of the Group’s taxable income and changes in local tax rates.
The Group’s average expected tax rate decreased to 20.5% in 2014 (2013: 22.6%). The main driver for the decrease was due to the
lower proportion of the Group’s profits from the US, which has a relatively higher local tax rate than the average Group rate. The lower
proportion of US profits was driven by goodwill impairments in 2014. There were no significant local tax rate changes in the main
operating areas of the Group compared to 2013.
The Group’s effective tax rate increased to 23.8% in 2014 (2013: 22.5%). This was mainly due to the goodwill impairments mentioned
above, that are not tax deductible, and the utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses in 2013. In addition, the effective tax rate
in 2013 includes the retrospective re-enactment of the US research and development tax credits for 2012, which means that the 2013
results included two years of these tax credits in respect of 2012 as well as 2013.
The Group’s effective tax rate can be reconciled to the Group’s average expected tax rate as follows:
Reconciliation of the Group’s effective tax rate
2014 2013
Average expected tax rate 20.5% 22.6%
Tax effect of
– Non-taxable income/non-deductible expenses +4.0% +2.0%
– Equity compensation plans +0.2% –0.2%
– Research, development and other manufacturing tax credits –2.5% –2.4%
– US state tax impacts +0.5% +0.4%

– Utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses – –0.7%
– Other differences –0.1% –0.1%
Group’s effective tax rate 23.8% 22.5%
The income tax benefit recorded in respect of equity compensation plans, which varies according to the price of the underlying equity,
was 64 million Swiss francs (2013: 122 million Swiss francs). Had the income tax benefits been recorded solely on the basis of the IFRS 2
expense multiplied by the applicable tax rate, then a benefit of approximately 96 million Swiss francs (2013: 100 million Swiss francs)
would have been recorded.

Roche Finance Report 2014 | 53Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward only to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit is probable.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses, including valuation allowances, as follows:
Unrecognised tax losses: expiry
2014 2013
Amount Applicable tax Amount Applicable tax
(mCHF) rate (mCHF) rate
Within one year – – – –
Between one and five years 588 14% 406 14%
More than five years 6,349 5% 4,078 5%
Total unrecognised tax losses 6,937 6% 4,484 6%
The ‘More than five years’ category includes losses that cannot be used for US state income tax purposes in those states which only
permit tax reporting on a separate entity basis.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been established for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the remittance of
earnings of foreign subsidiaries, where such amounts are currently regarded as permanently reinvested. The total unremitted earnings of
the Group, regarded as permanently reinvested, were 29.3 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2014 (2013: 29.7 billion Swiss francs).

Pharmaceuticals
Seragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. On 27 August 2014 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Seragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(‘Seragon’), a US private company based in San Diego, California. With the acquisition, the Group has obtained rights to Seragon’s
entire portfolio of selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) for the potential treatment of hormone receptor-positive cancers.
Seragon’s lead product candidate, ARN-810, is a next-generation SERD that is currently in phase I clinical trials for patients who have

Roche Finance Report 2014 | 55Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The fair value of the intangible assets is determined using an excess earning method that is based on management forecasts and
observable market data for discount rates, tax rates and foreign exchange rates. The present value is calculated using a risk-adjusted
discount rate of 9.5% for Seragon, 8.9% to 9.4% for Santaris and 9.0% to 9.5% for InterMune. The valuations were performed by
independent valuers. The intangible asset allocation for Dutalys is based on historical experience of similar acquisitions and the valuation
will be completed by an independent valuer in the first half of 2015.
The fair value of InterMune inventories is determined based on the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less
the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort to complete and sell the inventories.
The InterMune accounts receivable comprise of gross contractual amounts due of 35 million Swiss francs which are all expected to
be collectable at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill represents a control premium, the acquired work force and the synergies that can be expected from integrating the acquired
companies into the Group’s existing business. For InterMune the control premium represents the premium paid over the traded market
price to obtain control of the business. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Directly attributable transaction costs of 15 million Swiss francs are reported in the Pharmaceuticals operating segment within general
and administration expenses and mainly relate to the InterMune acquisition.
In the three months to 31 December 2014 InterMune contributed revenue of 44 million Swiss francs and a net loss of 292 million
Swiss francs to the results reported for the Pharmaceuticals Division and the Group. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2014
management estimates that InterMune would have contributed revenue of 144 million Swiss francs and a net loss of 790 million Swiss
francs. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group
that would have occurred had InterMune actually been acquired at the beginning of the year, or indicative of the future results of the
combined Group. The impact of the Seragon, Santaris and Dutalys acquisitions on the 2014 results were not material.

the Division was 128 million Swiss francs, and included costs related to IT projects and the restructuring of the former Applied Science
business.
Roche Finance Report 2014 | 59Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Site consolidation
The operational closure of the US site in Nutley, New Jersey, was completed on schedule by the end of 2013 and the Group is currently
in the process of divesting the site. Work on remediating the Nutley site is continuing, but no significant additional restructuring expenses
were incurred in 2014. Other site consolidation costs include those related to the closure of Toluca, Mexico (Pharmaceuticals) and Graz,
Austria (Diagnostics) sites.
Other global restructuring plans
In 2014 total costs were 436 million Swiss francs, with one major item being a goodwill impairment of 139 million Swiss francs related
to the Marcadia acquisition in 2010 following the exit from cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Other significant costs included
121 million Swiss francs relating to field force reductions across Europe in the Pharmaceuticals Division’s Specialty Care unit. InterMune
integration costs were 79 million Swiss francs and costs of 46 million Swiss francs arose from the implementation of the global
outsourcing of clinical trial monitoring in the Pharmaceuticals Division. The remaining minor plans totalled 51 million Swiss francs.
In 2013 the Pharmaceuticals Division announced that, as part of its investments to increase its global biologic medicine manufacturing
network capacity, a bulk drug production unit at the Vacaville site in California that had been discontinued and fully written down in 2009
will be put back into service. This resulted in an income of 531 million Swiss francs from the reversal of previously incurred impairment
charges (see Note 7).

Impairment reversal (charge) – 2013
On 14 October 2013 the Pharmaceuticals Division announced details of investments to increase its global biologic medicine manufacturing
network capacity to meet the rising demand for licensed biologics and expected pipeline growth. The investments will be spread across
sites in Penzberg, Germany, Basel, Switzerland as well as Vacaville and Oceanside, US. In 2009 a bulk drug production unit at the
Vacaville site in California, which was not yet licensed, was discontinued and fully written down as part of a reassessment of the global
manufacturing network requirements at that time. The bulk drug production unit at the Vacaville site will require capital investment
before it can become operational, which is expected to occur in 2015. The Group’s decision to restart licensing efforts and prepare
for operational use of the discontinued bulk drug production unit at the Vacaville site for commercial manufacturing has resulted in
an impairment reversal of property, plant and equipment of 531 million Swiss francs in 2013. The impairment reversal of 531 million Swiss
francs represents the net book value from the time of the original impairment for the assets that will be brought back into use, less the
depreciation that would have been charged in the intervening period had that impairment not occurred.

Impairment charge
During 2014 impairment charges totalling 874 million Swiss francs were recorded which related to:
A goodwill impairment charge of 552 million Swiss francs was recorded for the full write-off of the goodwill in the Tissue Diagnostics
business area within the Diagnostics Division. This impairment is based on the latest business plans prepared during the second half
of 2014. The factors leading to this impairment were: (i) A decrease in forecasted cash flows following a reassessment of a late stage
future product development which has been returned to a pre-design phase, combined with additional US reductions in
immunohistochemistry testing reimbursement to laboratories and the business plan projection period being reduced from ten years to
five years; and (ii) An increase in the pre-tax discount rate used for impairment testing to 9.5% in 2014 compared to 8.8% in 2013. In
addition impairments of 643 million Swiss francs were recorded for product intangibles in the Tissue Diagnostics business (see Note 9).
A goodwill impairment charge of 322 million Swiss francs was recorded in the Pharmaceuticals Division for the full write-off of goodwill
from the Marcadia acquisition in 2010, the Memory acquisition in 2009 and the ARIUS and Piramed acquisitions in 2008 which are all
deemed to have been disposed of.
Roche Finance Report 2014 | 65Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
During 2013 impairment charges totalling 288 million Swiss francs were recorded which related to:
A goodwill impairment charge of 253 million Swiss francs was recorded in the Tissue Diagnostics business area within the Diagnostics
Division. This impairment was based on the latest business plans prepared during the second half of 2013. The main factors leading to
this impairment were reduced revenue expectations in the US following recent changes in the College of American Pathologists guidelines
for the use of negative reagent controls in immunohistochemistry testing which reduced volumes and changes which reduced the
reimbursement amount to laboratories.
On 23 April 2013 the Group announced a reorganisation of the Applied Science business area. A goodwill impairment charge of
35 million Swiss francs was incurred for the full write-off of the goodwill from the 454 Life Sciences acquisition in 2007 and the Innovatis
acquisition in 2009 in the former Applied Science business area.
Impairment testing
Pharmaceuticals Division. The Division’s operating segments are the cash-generating units used for the testing of goodwill.
For Chugai, the recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs to sell, determined with reference to the publicly quoted share prices
of Chugai shares. For Roche Pharmaceuticals, the recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is based on value in use. The cash
flow projections used for Roche Pharmaceuticals impairment testing are based on the most recent business plans approved by management.
The business plans include management’s latest estimates on sales volume and pricing, as well as production and other operating costs
and assume no significant changes in the organisation.
The business plans are projected over five years. These valuations include a terminal value beyond these years, assuming no further
growth. The discount rate used is based on an after-tax rate of 7.7% (2013: 7.3%), which is derived from a capital asset pricing model
using data from capital markets, including government twenty-year bonds. A weighted average tax rate of 25.6% (2013: 25.5%) is used
in the calculations and the corresponding pre-tax discount rate is 10.4% (2013: 9.8%).
Diagnostics Division. The Division’s business areas are the cash-generating units used for the testing of goodwill. The goodwill arising
from the Corange/Boehringer Mannheim acquisition and part of the goodwill from the Ventana acquisition is recorded and monitored
at a Divisional level as it relates to the strategic development of the whole Division and cannot be meaningfully allocated to the Division’s
business areas. Therefore the cash-generating unit for this goodwill is the entire Division.
The recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is based on value in use and the cash flow projections are based on the most
recent business plans approved by management. The business plans include management’s latest estimates on sales volume and pricing,
as well as production and other operating costs and assume no significant changes in the organisation.
The business plans are projected over five years. These valuations include a terminal value beyond these years, assuming no further
growth. The discount rate used is based on an after-tax rate of 7.7% (2013: 7.3%), which is derived from a capital asset pricing model
using data from capital markets, including government twenty-year bonds. A weighted average tax rate of 18.4% (2013: 17.6%) is used
in the calculations and the corresponding pre-tax discount rate is 9.5% (2013: 8.8%).
Sensitivity analysis
Management has performed sensitivity analyses for both Roche Pharmaceuticals and the Diagnostics Division, which increased the
discount rate by 1% combined with decreasing the forecast cash flows by 5%, and for Chugai, which decreased the publicly quoted
share prices by 5%. The results of the sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the above changes in the key assumptions would not
cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount at 31 December 2014.

Internally generated intangible assets
The Group currently has no internally generated intangible assets from development as the criteria for the recognition as an asset are
not met.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
The Group currently has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Intangible assets not available for use
These mostly represent in-process research and development assets acquired either through in-licensing arrangements, business
combinations or separate purchases. At 31 December 2014 approximately 29% of the projects in the Pharmaceuticals Division have
known decision points within the next twelve months which in certain circumstances could lead to impairment. Due to the inherent
uncertainties in the research and development processes, intangible assets not available for use are particularly at risk of impairment
if the project is not expected to result in a commercialised product.
68 | Roche Finance Report 2014Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Intangible asset impairment
Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
eventual disposal. Factors such as the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence or lower than anticipated sales for
products with capitalised rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
Impairment charges – 2014
Pharmaceuticals Division. Impairment charges totalling 337 million Swiss francs were recorded which related to:
A clinical data assessment of one development project (102 million Swiss francs). The asset concerned, which was not yet being
amortised, was fully written down.
A decision to stop development of a compound acquired as part of a previous business combination (88 million Swiss francs). The asset
concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
A decision to stop development of a compound with an alliance partner (78 million Swiss francs). The asset concerned, which was not
yet being amortised, was fully written down.
A reassessment of two projects within the hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise (37 million Swiss francs) mainly due to the negative
outcome of an arbitration against a competitor. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully written down.
A decision to stop development of one compound (24 million Swiss francs). The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised,
was fully written down.
A decision to stop one collaboration project with an alliance partner (8 million Swiss francs). The assets concerned, which was not yet
being amortised, was fully written down.
Diagnostics Division. Impairment charges totalling 697 million Swiss francs were recorded which related to:
Tissue Diagnostics product intangibles not available for use (472 million Swiss francs). The factors leading to this impairment were
a reassessment of a late stage future product development which has been returned to a pre-design phase to demonstrate feasibility
and quality improvement. The asset concerned, which was not yet in use, was fully written down.
Tissue Diagnostics product intangibles in use (171 million Swiss francs): The factors leading to this impairment were a decrease
in forecasted cash flows following the US reductions in immunohistochemistry testing reimbursement to laboratories and an increase
in the asset-specific pre-tax discount rate used for impairment testing to 12.5% in 2014 compared to 11.7% in 2013. The assets
concerned, which were being amortised, were written down to their estimated recoverable value of 122 million Swiss francs.
Diabetes Care technology intangibles in use (54 million Swiss francs). The factors leading to this impairment were a decrease in
forecasted cash flows following a change in the timelines for future product development and an increase in the asset specific pre-
tax discount rate used for impairment testing to 9.5% in 2014 compared to 8.8% in 2013. The assets concerned, which were being
amortised, were written down to their estimated recoverable value of 39 million Swiss francs.
Impairment charges – 2013
Pharmaceuticals Division. Impairment charges totalling 350 million Swiss francs were recorded which related to:
A portfolio reassessment within the hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise (286 million Swiss francs). The assets concerned, which were not

A portfolio reassessment within the cardiovascular and metabolic diseases franchise (31 million Swiss francs). The asset concerned,
which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
A decision to stop two collaboration projects with alliance partners (26 million Swiss francs). The assets concerned, which were being
amortised, were fully written down.
A decision to stop development of one compound with an alliance partner (7 million Swiss francs). The asset concerned, which was not
yet being amortised, was fully written down.
Diagnostics Division. Impairment charges totalling 12 million Swiss francs were recorded from the Applied Science business area
reorganisation. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully written down.

Potential commitments from alliance collaborations
The Group is party to in-licensing and similar arrangements with its alliance partners. These arrangements may require the Group
to make certain milestone or other similar payments dependent upon the achievement of agreed objectives or performance targets as
defined in the collaboration agreements.
The Group’s current estimate of future third-party commitments for such payments is set out in the table below. These figures are
undiscounted and are not risk-adjusted, meaning that they include all such potential payments that can arise assuming all projects
currently in development are successful. The timing is based on the Group’s current best estimate. These figures do not include any
potential commitments within the Group, such as may arise between the Roche and Chugai businesses.

Legal provisions consist of a number of separate legal matters, including claims arising from trade, in various Group companies. By their
nature the amounts and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict.
In 2014 legal expenses totalled 203 million Swiss francs (2013: 97 million Swiss francs) which reflect the recent developments in various
legal matters. Details of the major legal cases outstanding are disclosed below.

Environmental provisions
Provisions for environmental matters include various separate environmental issues in a number of countries. By their nature the amounts
and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict. Significant provisions are discounted by between 2% and 4% where the time value
of money is material. The significant provisions relate to the closure of the US site in Nutley, New Jersey and the estimated remediation
costs for a landfill site near Grenzach, Germany that was used by manufacturing operations that were closed some years ago.
Restructuring provisions
These arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of business undertaken by the Group or the manner in which
business is conducted. Such provisions include only the costs necessarily entailed by the restructuring which are not associated with
the recurring activities of the Group. The timings of these cash outflows are reasonably certain. These provisions are not discounted
as the time value of money is not material in these matters.
In the Pharmaceuticals Division the significant provisions relate to the specialty care field force restructuring across Europe, the closure
of the US site in Nutley, New Jersey, the global outsourcing of clinical trial monitoring and the InterMune integration. In the Diagnostics
Division the significant provisions relate to the restructuring of the Diabetes Care and Applied Science businesses.
Employee provisions
These mostly relate to certain employee benefit obligations, such as sabbatical leave and long-service benefits. The timings of these cash
outflows can be reasonably estimated based on past experience.
Other provisions
The timing of cash outflows are by their nature uncertain and other provisions relate to the items shown in the table below.

Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees, to be affected by political, legislative, fiscal
and regulatory developments, including those relating to environmental protection, in the countries in which it operates. The industries
in which the Group operates are also subject to other risks of various kinds. The nature and frequency of these developments and events,
not all of which are covered by insurance, as well as their effect on future operations and earnings, are not predictable.
The Group has entered into strategic alliances with various companies in order to gain access to potential new products or to utilise other
companies to help develop the Group’s own potential new products. Potential future payments may become due to certain collaboration
partners achieving certain milestones as defined in the collaboration agreements. The Group’s best estimates of future commitments for
such payments are given in Note 9.

Pharmaceuticals legal cases
Accutane. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (‘HLR’) and various other Roche affiliates have been named as defendants in numerous legal actions
in the US and elsewhere relating to the acne medication Accutane. The litigation alleges that Accutane caused certain serious conditions,
including, but not limited to, inflammatory bowel disease (‘IBD’), birth defects and psychiatric disorders. Since 1 January 2014 there have
been approximately 900 cases dismissed in the US and at 31 December 2014 HLR was defending approximately 6,650 actions involving
approximately 6,700 plaintiffs brought in various federal and state courts throughout the US for personal injuries allegedly resulting from
their use of Accutane. Most of the actions allege IBD as a result of Accutane use. In 2009 HLR announced that, following a re-evaluation
of its portfolio of medicines that are now available from generic manufacturers, rapidly declining brand sales in the US and high costs
from personal-injury lawsuits that it continues to defend vigorously, it had decided to immediately discontinue the manufacture and
distribution of the product in the US.
All of the actions pending in federal court alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation in
the US District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division. Since July 2007 the District Court has granted summary judgment
in favour of HLR for all of the federal IBD cases that have proceeded. Since August 2008 all of these rulings have been affirmed by
the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit when plaintiffs appealed. Multiple recently filed matters remain pending.
All of the actions pending in state court in New Jersey alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the Superior Court
of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County. At 31 December 2014 juries in the Superior Court have ruled in favour of the plaintiff in
eight cases, assessing compensatory damages totalling 59 million US dollars. For the eight cases that were ruled in favour of the plaintiff
by the Superior Court, HLR is in the process of appealing four cases (45 million US dollars) and four cases have had their verdicts
reversed in favour of HLR (14 million US dollars).
Additional trials may be scheduled for 2015. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including many that are unique to
the particular case and therefore the trial results to date may not be predictive of future trial results. The Group continues to defend
vigorously the remaining personal injury cases and claims.
Avastin/Lucentis investigations. On 14 February 2013 the Italian Antitrust Authority (‘AGCM’) announced an investigation to determine
whether Roche, Genentech and Novartis had entered into an agreement to restrict competition in the Italian market for drugs, with reference
in particular to Avastin (marketed by Roche) and Lucentis (marketed by Novartis). Avastin and Lucentis are two different drugs that were
developed and approved for different therapeutic purposes and contain different active pharmaceutical ingredients. On 5 March 2014
the AGCM issued a verdict that alleges that Roche and Novartis colluded to artificially differentiate Avastin and Lucentis in order to foster
the sales of Lucentis in Italy. The AGCM fined Roche 90.5 million euros and Novartis 92 million euros. Roche appealed the AGCM verdict
to the Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale del Lazio (‘TAR’). On 2 December 2014 the TAR upheld the decision by the AGCM. Roche
strongly disagrees with the verdict of the TAR and will appeal. On 30 May 2014 the Italian Ministry of Health notified Roche S.p.A. of its
intention to seek damages related to this matter. In July 2014 Roche paid the 90.5 million euros fine under protest to avoid additional
penalty fees and recorded an expense within general and administration. The fine and related interest will be reimbursed if Roche wins
the case. The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Tarceva subpoena. On 2 November 2011 Genentech received a subpoena from the US Department of Justice (‘DOJ’), requesting
documents and information related to the promotion of Tarceva, a prescription product initially approved for the treatment of locally
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, and later approved for
additional indications. Genentech is cooperating with the associated investigation which is both civil and criminal in nature. On 6 May
2014 government representatives presented for the first time the government’s civil liability theory, specifically that Genentech allegedly
participated in the off-label promotion of Tarceva causing the submission of false claims for reimbursement under the Civil False
Claims Act. Subsequently, Genentech has had, and expects to continue to have, meetings and other communications with government
representatives to discuss the company’s and the government’s respective views of legal and factual issues, and to discuss whether
a negotiated mutually-agreeable settlement is possible. In Q4 2014, at the request of the government, Genentech made a presentation
regarding the various reasons why the company believes the government should decline to make any criminal claim against the company.
A number of current and/or former Genentech employees received subpoenas for grand jury testimony beginning in January 2015.
The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Rituxan arbitration. In October 2008 Genentech and Biogen Idec Inc. filed a complaint in California against Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland
GmbH, Sanofi-Aventis US LLC and Sanofi-Aventis US Inc. (‘Sanofi’) seeking a declaratory judgment that certain Genentech products,
including Rituxan, do not infringe Sanofi’s US Patent Nos. 5,849,522 and 6,218,140 and that the ‘522 and ‘140 patents are invalid. Sanofi
alleged that Rituxan and another Genentech product infringe certain claims of the ‘522 and ‘140 patents. In March 2011 the district court
ruled as a matter of law that Genentech and Biogen Idec do not infringe the asserted patent claims. In May 2011 Sanofi appealed the
court’s non-infringement ruling. The appellate court affirmed the district court’s judgment of no patent infringement.
In addition in October 2008 Sanofi affiliate Hoechst GmbH (‘Hoechst’) filed with the ICC International Court of Arbitration (Paris)
a request for arbitration with Genentech, relating to a terminated patent-license agreement between one of Hoechst’s predecessors
and Genentech that pertained to the above-mentioned patents and related patents outside the US. Hoechst sought payment of patent-
license royalties on sales of certain Genentech products, including Rituxan, damages for breach of contract, and other relief. In various
arbitral awards in September 2012 and February 2013, the arbitrator found Genentech liable to Hoechst for patent-license royalties on
Rituxan, and he awarded the royalties and interest that Hoechst had sought. In February 2013 the Group recorded a back royalty expense
of 42 million Swiss francs, net of the assumed reimbursement of a portion of the Group’s obligation by its co-promotion partner in the US.
Hoechst initiated proceedings in the US, France and Germany seeking to enforce the arbitral awards. In October 2013 Genentech paid
the awarded royalties and interest to Hoechst under protest. Genentech is seeking annulment of the arbitral awards through proceedings
it initiated in the Court of Appeal of Paris. There was a hearing in those proceedings in June 2014. In September 2014 the Paris Court
of Appeal stayed the annulment proceedings to seek guidance from the EU Court of Justice on a specific legal question that had been
raised by Genentech relating to the arbitral award’s non-compliance under EU competition laws. In November 2014 Hoechst filed notices
of appeal to the French Supreme Court seeking to review the Paris Court of Appeal’s decision to seek guidance from the EU Court of
Justice. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Average Wholesale Prices litigation. HLR and Roche Laboratories Inc. (‘RLI’), along with approximately 50 other brand and generic
pharmaceutical companies, have been named as defendants in several legal actions in the US relating to the pricing of pharmaceutical
drugs and State Medicaid reimbursement. The primary allegation in these litigations is that the pharmaceutical companies misrepresented
or otherwise reported inaccurate Average Wholesale Prices (‘AWP’) and/or Wholesale Acquisition Costs (‘WAC’) for their drugs, which
prices were allegedly relied upon by the States in calculating Medicaid reimbursements to entities such as retail pharmacies. The States,
through their respective Attorney General, are seeking repayment of the amounts they claim were over-reimbursed. The time period
associated with these cases is 1991 through 2005. At 31 December 2014 HLR and RLI are defending one AWP action filed in the state
of New Jersey. HLR and RLI are vigorously defending themselves in this matter. Limited fact discovery remains outstanding and briefing
on Class Certification has been postponed until the second half of 2015. No trial date has been set in this matter. The outcome of this
matter cannot be determined at this time.
PDL litigation. In August 2010 PDL Biopharma (‘PDL’) filed a complaint in Nevada against Genentech seeking a judicial declaration
concerning Genentech’s obligation to pay royalties on certain ex-US sales of Herceptin, Avastin, Xolair and Lucentis under a 2003
agreement between the parties. In September 2010 PDL filed a first amended complaint asserting additional claims against Genentech,
including breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. PDL also asserted new claims against
Roche and Novartis for intentional interference with contractual relations. In addition to declaratory relief, PDL sought monetary damages
including compensatory and liquidated damages. In November 2010 Genentech and Roche filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state
a claim, and Roche filed an additional motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. In July 2011 the court denied the motions. PDL
settled its claim against Novartis.
In addition to the litigation, PDL conducted a royalty audit related to sales of Avastin, Herceptin, Lucentis, Xolair and Raptiva for the
years 2007 through 2009. The final audit report indicated that, under PDL’s interpretation of certain contract terms, Genentech owed
PDL additional royalties for the audit period. Under the same interpretation, Genentech may have owed additional royalties for years
subsequent to the audit period. The Group disputed PDL’s interpretation of the relevant contract terms. In June 2013 PDL filed a demand
for arbitration related to its audit claims with the American Arbitration Association.
On 31 January 2014 the parties agreed to a settlement that resolved all of the disputes between them. Under the settlement agreement,
PDL agreed to dismiss all of its claims against Genentech and Roche. In return Genentech agreed to pay PDL a single fixed royalty rate
until the end of 2015. All of these matters are now concluded.
Roche Finance Report 2014 | 77Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
GSK litigation. In September 2010 GlaxoSmithKline LLC (‘GSK’) and Genentech each filed patent lawsuits against one another
in Delaware and California, respectively. The lawsuits concerned GSK’s US Patent Nos. RE40,070 and RE41,555. GSK asserted claims
against Genentech alleging infringement of the patents by Herceptin and Lucentis, and was seeking compensatory damages. In its
lawsuit Genentech was seeking a judicial declaration of non-infringement and invalidity of the patents. In June 2012 the parties agreed
to dismiss the California action without prejudice and the consolidated case proceeded in Delaware. On 22 August 2013 the Delaware
Court issued a claim construction order construing two terms of the ‘555 patent. On 16 July 2014 the parties signed a settlement
agreement that resolved all of the disputes between them. All of these matters are now concluded.
Boniva litigation. HLR, Genentech and various other Roche affiliates (collectively ‘Roche’) have been named as defendants in numerous
legal actions in the US and Canada relating to the post-menopausal osteoporosis medication Boniva. In these litigations, the plaintiffs
allege that Boniva caused either osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypical femoral fractures. At 31 December 2014 Roche is defending
approximately 291 actions involving approximately 336 plaintiffs brought in federal and state courts throughout the US and one action
brought in the Court of the Queen’s Bench, Province of Saskatchewan, Canada, for personal injuries allegedly resulting from the use of
Boniva. All of these cases are in the early discovery stages of litigation. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including
many that are unique to the particular case. Roche is vigorously defending itself in these matters. The outcome of these matters cannot
be determined at this time.
EMA investigation. On 23 October 2012 the European Medicines Agency (‘EMA’) announced that it would start an infringement
procedure to investigate allegations regarding an alleged breach of medicines safety reporting obligations in relation to 19 centrally
authorised medicines. On 19 November 2013 the EMA announced the results of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee
assessment of Roche’s medicines. The EMA found no impact regarding the benefit-risk balance of any of Roche’s medicines and confirmed
the benefit-risk profiles based on available safety information. The EMA and other health authorities have confirmed all medicines remain
authorised without changes to the treatment advice for patients and healthcare professionals. All corrective and preventative actions
resulting from the inspections are being implemented. A re-inspection by authorities in November 2013 led to certain findings which
Roche is now addressing. On 14 April 2014 the EMA issued its report to the European Commission that summarises the EMA’s findings
in relation to the investigation. The European Commission will now decide whether the matter should be pursued and financial penalties
should be imposed. The decision of the European Commission on this matter is still pending. The outcome of this matter cannot be
determined at this time.

payments of these notes discounted to the redemption date at the US Treasury rate plus 0.50%, together with accrued and unpaid
interest on the principal. A cash outflow of approximately 689 million US dollars, plus accrued interest, is expected on redemption.
The Group has revised the carrying value of these notes to take into account the changes to the amounts and timings of the estimated
cash flows. The revised carrying value of these notes at 31 December 2014 is 688 million US dollars (681 million Swiss francs). The
increase in carrying value of 95 million US dollars (88 million Swiss francs) is recorded within financing costs (see Note 3) as a loss on
redemption. The effective interest rate of these notes is 6.37%.

Genentech transaction
The Group completed the purchase of the non-controlling interests in Genentech effective 26 March 2009. Based on the International
Accounting Standard 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ (IAS 27) and consistent with the International Financial Reporting Standard 10
‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ (IFRS 10), which was adopted by the Group in 2013, this transaction was accounted for in full
as an equity transaction. As a consequence, the carrying amount of the consolidated equity of the Group at that time was reduced by
52.2 billion Swiss francs, of which 8.5 billion Swiss francs was allocated to eliminate the book value of Genentech non-controlling
interests. This accounting effect significantly impacted the Group’s net equity, but has no effect on the Group’s business or its dividend
policy.
Roche Finance Report 2014 | 85Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Share capital
At 31 December 2014 the authorised and issued share capital of Roche Holding Ltd, which is the Group’s parent company, consisted of
160 million shares with a nominal value of 1.00 Swiss franc each, as in the preceding year. The shares are bearer shares and the Group
does not maintain a register of shareholders. Based on information supplied to the Group, a shareholder group with pooled voting rights
owns 45.01% (2013: 45.01%) of the issued shares. On 24 March 2011 the shareholder group announced that it would continue the
shareholder pooling agreement existing since 1948 with a modified shareholder composition. The shareholder group with pooled voting
rights now holds 72,018,000 shares, corresponding to 45.01% of the shares issued. This figure does not include any shares without
pooled voting rights that are held outside this group by individual members of the group. Ms Maja Oeri, formerly a member of the pool,
now holds 8,091,900 shares representing 5.057% of the voting rights independently of the pool. This is further described in Note 30.
Based on information supplied to the Group, Novartis Ltd, Basel, and its affiliates own 33.333% (participation below 331⁄3%) of the issued
shares (2013: 33.333%).
Non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
At 31 December 2014, 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities have been authorised and were in issue as in the preceding year.
Under Swiss company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value, are not part of the share capital and cannot be
issued against a contribution which would be shown as an asset in the balance sheet of Roche Holding Ltd. Each non-voting equity
security confers the same rights as any of the shares to participate in the net profit and any remaining proceeds from liquidation
following repayment of the nominal value of the shares and, if any, participation certificates. In accordance with the law and the Articles
of Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd, the Company is entitled at all times to exchange all or some of the non-voting equity securities
into shares or participation certificates.
Dividends
On 4 March 2014 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of 7.80 Swiss francs per share and non-voting equity security
(2013: 7.35 Swiss francs) in respect of the 2013 business year. The distribution to holders of outstanding shares and non-voting equity
securities totalled 6,617 million Swiss francs (2013: 6,238 million Swiss francs) and has been recorded against retained earnings in 2014.
The Board of Directors has proposed dividends for the 2014 business year of 8.00 Swiss francs per share and non-voting equity security
which, if approved, would result in a total distribution to shareholders of 6,901 million Swiss francs. This is subject to approval at the
Annual General Meeting on 3 March 2015.

22. Chugai
Effective 1 October 2002 the Roche Group and Chugai completed an alliance to create a leading research-driven Japanese
pharmaceutical company, which was formed by the merger of Chugai and Roche’s Japanese pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Nippon Roche.
The merged company is known as Chugai.
Consolidated subsidiary
Chugai is a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group. This is based on the Group’s interest in Chugai at 31 December 2014 of 61.46%
(2013: 61.54%) and the Roche relationship with Chugai that is founded on the Basic Alliance, Licensing and Research Collaboration
Agreements.
The common stock of Chugai is publicly traded and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the stock code ‘TSE:4519’. Chugai
prepares financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) which are filed on a quarterly basis
with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to certain consolidation entries there are minor differences between Chugai’s stand-alone IFRS
results and the results of Chugai as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS.

Dividends
The dividends distributed to third parties holding Chugai shares during 2014 totalled 81 million Swiss francs (2013: 84 million Swiss francs)
and have been recorded against non-controlling interests (see Note 23). Dividends paid by Chugai to Roche are eliminated on
consolidation as inter-company items.
Roche’s relationship with Chugai
Chugai has entered into certain agreements with Roche, which are discussed below:
Basic Alliance Agreement. As part of the Basic Alliance Agreement signed in December 2001, Roche and Chugai entered into certain
arrangements covering the future operation and governance of Chugai. Amongst other matters these cover the following areas:
The structuring of the alliance.
Roche’s rights as a shareholder.
Roche’s rights to nominate members of Chugai’s Board of Directors.
Certain limitations to Roche’s ability to buy or sell Chugai’s common stock.
Chugai issues additional shares of common stock in connection with its convertible debt and equity compensation plans, and may issue
additional shares for other purposes, which affects Roche’s percentage ownership interest. The Basic Alliance Agreement provides,
amongst other matters, that Chugai will guarantee Roche’s right to maintain its shareholding percentage in Chugai at not less than 50.1%.
Licensing Agreements. Under the Japan Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in December 2001, Chugai has exclusive rights to market
Roche’s pharmaceutical products in Japan. Chugai also has the right of first refusal on the development and marketing in Japan of all
development compounds advanced by Roche.
The Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement (excluding Japan and South Korea) signed in May 2002 was revised and the Amended
and Restated Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement (excluding Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) was signed in August 2014.
Under this Agreement Roche has the right of first refusal on the development and marketing of Chugai’s development compounds in
markets outside Japan, excluding South Korea and Taiwan.
Further to these agreements, Roche and Chugai have signed a series of separate agreements for certain specific products. Depending
on the specific circumstances and the terms of the agreement, this may result in payments on an arm’s length basis between Roche and
Chugai, for any or all of the following matters:
Upfront payments, if a right of first refusal to license a product is exercised.
Milestone payments, dependent upon the achievement of agreed performance targets.
Royalties on future product sales.
These specific product agreements may also cover the manufacture and supply of the respective products to meet the other party’s
clinical and/or commercial requirements on an arm’s length basis.
Research Collaboration Agreements. Roche and Chugai have entered into research collaboration agreements in the areas of small-
molecule synthetic drug research and biotechnology-based drug discovery.

Roche Finance Report 2014 | 89Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
25. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group’s objective is to provide attractive and competitive post-employment benefits to employees, while at the same time ensuring
that the various plans are appropriately financed and managing any potential impacts on the Group’s long-term financial position. Most
employees are covered by pension plans sponsored by Group companies. The nature of such plans varies according to legal regulations,
fiscal requirements and market practice in the countries in which the employees are employed. Post-employment benefit plans are
classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund or to a third-party financial
institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. All other plans are classified as ‘defined
benefit plans’.
Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans are funded through payments by employees and by the Group to funds administered by third parties. The
Group’s expenses for these plans were 364 million Swiss francs (2013: 343 million Swiss francs). No assets or liabilities are recognised
in the Group’s balance sheet in respect of such plans, apart from regular prepayments and accruals of the contributions withheld from
employees’ wages and salaries and of the Group’s contributions. The Group’s major defined contribution plans are in the US, notably
the US Roche 401(k) Savings Plan.
Defined benefit plans
Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by payments from Group companies and by employees.
In some cases, notably for the major defined benefit plans in Germany, the plans are unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired
employees directly from its own financial resources. Plans are usually governed by a senior governing body, such as a Board of Trustees,
which is typically composed of both employee and employer representatives. Funding of these plans is determined by local regulations
using independent actuarial valuations. Separate independent actuarial valuations, together with a semi-annual update, are prepared
in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 for use in the Group’s financial statements. The Group’s major pension plans are located
in Switzerland, the US and Germany, which in total account for 82% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation (2013: 81%).
Pension plans in Switzerland. Current pension arrangements for employees in Switzerland are made through plans governed by
the Swiss Federal Occupational Old Age, Survivors and Disability Pension Act (‘BVG’). The Group’s pension plans are administered by
separate legal foundations, which are funded by regular employee and company contributions. The final benefit is contribution-based
with certain minimum guarantees. Due to these minimum guarantees, the Swiss plans are treated as defined benefit plans for the
purposes of these IFRS financial statements, although they have many of the characteristics of defined contribution plans. Where there
is an under-funding this may be remedied by various measures such as increasing employee and company contributions, lowering
the interest rate on retirement account balances, reducing prospective benefits and a suspension of the early withdrawal facility.
Past service costs in 2013 include 142 million Swiss francs of income recorded in respect of changes to the Group’s pension plans in
Switzerland. The change represents the adoption of lower conversion rates, which determines the annuity at the normal retirement age.
Pension plans in the US. The Group’s major defined benefit plans in the US have been closed to new members since 2007. New
employees in the US now join the defined contribution plan. The largest of the remaining defined benefit plans are funded pension plans,
including separate plans originating from the Nutley, Palo Alto and Indianapolis sites, together with smaller unfunded supplementary
retirement plans. The benefits are based on the highest average annual rate of earnings during a specified period and length of
employment. The plans are non-contributory for employees, with the Group making periodic payments to the plans. In 2014 payments
made by the Group were 130 million US dollars (2013: 130 million US dollars). Where there is an under-funding this would normally
be remedied by additional company contributions.
In 2013 some of the US pension plans made an offer to deferred vested members to settle the defined benefit obligation for a lump sum
payment. The total lump sum payment made from defined benefit assets was 244 million US dollars (226 million Swiss francs), which
settled an obligation of 264 million US dollars (245 million Swiss francs). This led to a gain of 20 million US dollars (19 million Swiss francs),
which is included as a settlement gain in 2013.
90 | Roche Finance Report 2014Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Pension plans in Germany. The Group’s major pension arrangements in Germany are governed by the Occupational Pensions Act
(‘BetrAVG’). These plans are unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources.
These plans are non-contributory for employees. The benefits are based on final salary and length of employment. These plans have
been closed to new members since 2007. They have been replaced by a new plan which is funded by regular employee and company
contributions and administered through a contractual trust agreement. The final benefit is contribution-based with a minimum guarantee.
Due to this minimum guarantee, this plan is treated as a defined benefit plan for the purposes of these IFRS financial statements,
although it has many of the characteristics of a defined contribution plan.
Past service costs in 2013 include 55 million Swiss francs of income recorded in respect of changes to the Group’s German pension
plans. This change represents the adoption of an increase in the normal retirement age.
Pension plans in the Rest of the World. These represent approximately 12% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation (2013: 13%) and
consist of a number of smaller plans in various countries. Of these the largest are the pension plans at Chugai, which are independently
managed by Chugai, and the main pension plan in the United Kingdom. The Chugai plans are fully described in Chugai’s own IFRS
financial statements. The UK pension plan is funded by regular employee and company contributions, with benefits based on final salary
and length of employment. This plan has been closed to new members since 2003 and has been replaced with a defined contribution
plan.
Past service costs in 2013 include 110 million Swiss francs of income recorded in respect of changes to the Group’s UK pension plans.
This reflects a change in the indexation of pension increases to the consumer price index instead of the previously used retail price index.
Other post-employment benefit (‘OPEB’) plans. These represent approximately 6% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation
(2013: 6%) and consist mostly of post-retirement healthcare and life insurance schemes, mainly in the US. These plans are mainly
unfunded and are contributory for employees, with the Group reimbursing retired employees directly from its own financial resources.
The Group’s major defined benefit OPEB plans in the US have been closed to new members since 2011. Part of the costs of these plans
is reimbursable under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. There is no statutory funding
requirement for these plans. The Group is funding these plans to the extent that it is tax efficient. In 2014 there were no payments made
by the Group to these plans (2013: none). At 31 December 2014 the IFRS funding status was 50% (2013: 57%), including reimbursement
rights, for the funded OPEB plans in the US.

Funding status
The funding of the Group’s various defined benefit plans is the responsibility of a senior governing body, such as a Board of Trustees,
and the sponsoring employer, and is managed based on local statutory valuations, which follow the legislation and requirements of
the respective jurisdiction in which the plan is established. Qualified independent actuaries carry out statutory actuarial valuations on
a regular basis. The actuarial assumptions determining the funding status on the statutory basis are regularly assessed by the local senior
governing body. The funding status is closely monitored at a corporate level.
During 2014 the fair value of plan assets increased due to favourable market conditions. Lower discount rates compared to 2013 resulted
in an increase in the overall defined benefit obligation. As a result the IFRS funded status of the funded defined benefit plans decreased
to 80% (2013: 88%).
Reimbursement rights are linked to the post-employment medical plans in the US and represent the expected reimbursement of
the medical expenditure provided under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.

Plan assets
The responsibility for the investment strategies of funded plans is with the senior governance body such as the Board of Trustees. Asset-
liability studies are performed regularly for all major pension plans. These studies examine the obligations from post-retirement benefit
plans, and evaluate various investment strategies with respect to key financial measures such as expected returns, expected risks,
expected contributions, and expected funded status of the plan in an interdependent way. The goal of an asset-liability study is to select
an appropriate asset allocation for the funds held within the plan. The investment strategy is developed to optimise expected returns, to
manage risks and to contain fluctuations in the statutory funded status. Asset-liability studies include strategies to match the cash flows
of the assets with the plan obligations. The Group currently does not use annuities or longevity swaps to manage longevity risk.
Plan assets are managed using internal and external asset managers. The actual performance is continually monitored by the pension
fund governance bodies as well as being closely monitored at a corporate level. In these financial statements the difference between
the interest income and actual return on plan assets is a remeasurement that is recorded directly to other comprehensive income.
During 2014 the actual return on plan assets was a gain of 1,020 million Swiss francs (2013: gain of 462 million Swiss francs).
The recognition of pension assets is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available from refunds from the plans or
reductions in future contributions to the plans.

At 31 December 12,452 11,144
Assets are invested in a variety of different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return as follows:
Equity and debt securities which mainly have quoted market prices (Level 1 fair value hierarchy).
Property which is mainly in private and commercial property funds which mainly have other observable inputs (Level 2 fair value
hierarchy).
Cash and money market instruments which are mainly invested with financial institutions with a credit rating no lower than A.
Other investments which mainly consist of alternatives, mortgages, commodities and insurance contracts. These are used for risk
management purposes and mainly have other observable inputs (Level 2 fair value hierarchy) and unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair
value hierarchy).
Included within the fair value of plan assets are the Group’s shares and non-voting securities with a fair value of 153 million Swiss francs
(2013: 165 million Swiss francs) and debt instruments issued by the Group with a fair value of 19 million Swiss francs (2013: 17 million
Swiss francs).
Defined benefit obligation
The defined benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method. This reflects service rendered by employees to the
dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of
benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth and mortality rates. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined
by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds in countries
where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. The corporate or government bonds are denominated in the currency in which
the benefits will be paid, and have maturity terms approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
The Group’s final salary-based defined benefit pension plans in the US, Germany and the United Kingdom have been closed to new
participants. Active employees that had been members of these pension plans at the time these were closed to new participants continue
to accrue benefits in the final salary-based defined benefit pension plans. New employees in the US and UK now join the Group’s defined
contribution plans, while new employees in Germany join the contribution-based plan with a minimum guarantee. The defined benefit
pension plans in Switzerland, where the final benefit is contribution-based with a minimum guarantee, remain open to new employees.
As a result, the proportion of the defined benefit obligation which relates to these closed plans is expected to decrease in the future.

Actuarial assumptions
The actuarial assumptions used in these financial statements are based on the requirements set out in IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’.
They are unbiased and mutually compatible estimates of variables that determine the ultimate cost of providing post-employment
benefits. They are set on an annual basis by local management, based on advice from actuaries, and are subject to approval by corporate
management and the Group’s actuaries. Actuarial assumptions consist of demographic assumptions on matters such as mortality and
employee turnover, and financial assumptions on matters such as interest rates, salary and benefit levels, inflation rates and costs of
medical benefits. The actuarial assumptions vary based upon local economic and social conditions. The actuarial assumptions used in
the various statutory valuations may differ from these based on local legal and regulatory requirements.
94 | Roche Finance Report 2014Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Demographic assumptions. The most significant demographic assumptions relate to mortality rates. The Group’s actuaries use mortality
tables which take into account historic patterns and expected changes, such as further increases in longevity. Rates of employee
turnover, disability and early retirement are based on historical behaviour within Group companies. The average life expectancy assumed
now for an individual at the age of 65 is as follows:
Defined benefit plans: average life expectancy for major schemes in years
Male Female
Country Mortality table 2014 2013 2014 2013
Switzerland BVG 2010 generational tables 21.4 21.3 23.9 23.8
United States RP-2014 projected with MP-2014 22.2 19.8 23.7 21.6
Germany Heubeck tables 2005G 18.9 18.7 22.9 22.8
During 2014 the US mortality tables were updated which increased the overall US defined benefit obligation by 332 million Swiss francs.
Financial assumptions. These are based on market expectations for the period over which the obligations are to be settled.
The assumptions used in the actuarial valuations are shown below.
Defined benefit plans: financial actuarial assumptions
2014 2013
Weighted Weighted
average Range average Range
Discount rates 2.21% 0.94%–6.50% 3.38% 1.53%–7.20%
Expected rates of salary increases 2.87% 2.00%–5.00% 2.98% 2.00%–5.20%
Expected rates of pension increases 0.91% 0.25%–2.20% 1.03% 0.25%–2.40%
Expected inflation rates 2.34% 2.00%–4.00% 2.60% 2.00%–4.00%

Ultimate medical cost trend rate (in 2029) 4.50% 4.50% 4.50% 4.50%
Discount rates are determined with reference to interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds in countries
where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. Expected rates of salary increases are based on expected inflation rates with an
adjustment to reflect the Group’s latest expectation of long-term real salary increases. Expected rates of pension increases are generally
linked to the expected inflation rate. Expected inflation rates are derived by looking at the level of inflation implied by the financial
markets in conjunction with the economists’ price inflation forecasts, historic price inflation as well as other economic variables and
circumstances. Medical cost trend rates take into account the benefits set out in the plan terms and expected future changes in medical
costs. Since the Group’s major post-employment medical plans are for US employees, these rates are driven by developments in the US.
Sensitivity analysis. The measurement of the net defined benefit obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate,
inflation rate, expected mortality and medical cost trend rate assumptions. The following table summarises the impact of a change in
those assumptions on the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
Defined benefit plans: sensitivity of defined benefit obligation to actuarial assumptions in millions of CHF
2014 2013
1 year increase in life expectancy 560 497
Discount rates
0.25% increase (797) (570)
0.25% decrease 799 600
Expected inflation rates

0.25% decrease (323) (221)
Immediate medical cost trend rate
1.00% increase 161 112
1.00% decrease (132) (94)
Each sensitivity analysis considers the change in one assumption at a time leaving the other assumptions unchanged. This approach
shows the isolated effect of changing one individual assumption but does not take into account that some assumptions are related.
The method used to carry out the sensitivity analysis is the same as in the prior year.

Cash flows
The Group incurred cash flows from its defined benefit plans as shown in the table below.
Defined benefit plans: cash flows in millions of CHF
2014 2013
Employer contributions, net of reimbursements – funded plans (364) (348)
Benefits paid – unfunded plans (156) (135)
Total cash inflow (outflow) (520) (483)
Based on the most recent actuarial valuations, the Group expects that employer contributions for funded plans in 2015 will be
approximately 361 million Swiss francs, which includes an estimated 149 million Swiss francs of additional contributions, mostly related to
the US defined benefit plans. Benefits paid for unfunded plans are estimated to be approximately 146 million Swiss francs, which mostly
relate to the German defined benefit plans.
26. Equity compensation plans
The Group operates several equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Chugai. IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ requires
that the fair value of all equity compensation plan awards granted to employees be estimated at grant date and recorded as an expense
over the vesting period.

Equity compensation plans
Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights. The Group issues Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) to certain
directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The S-SARs give employees the right to receive non-voting
equity securities reflecting the value of any appreciation in the market price of the non-voting equity securities between the grant date
and the exercise date. Under the Roche S-SAR Plan 180 million S-SARs will be available for issuance over a ten-year period. The rights,
which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years.

Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan. The Group issues Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) awards to certain directors, management and
employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The RSUs, which are non-tradable, represent the right to receive non-voting equity
securities which vest only after a three-year period, subject to performance conditions, if any. There are currently no performance
conditions on outstanding RSUs at 31 December 2014. Under the Roche RSU Plan 20 million non-voting equity securities will be available
for issuance over a ten-year period. The Roche RSU Plan also includes a value adjustment which will be an amount equivalent to the
sum of shareholder distributions made by the Group during the vesting period attributable to the number of non-voting equity securities
for which an individual award has been granted.

Roche Performance Share Plan. The Group offers future non-voting equity security awards (or, at the discretion of the Board of
Directors, their cash equivalent) to certain directors and key senior managers. These are non-tradable equity-settled awards. The
programme currently operates in annual three-year cycles. The Roche PSP Plan includes a value adjustment which will be an amount
equivalent to the sum of shareholder distributions made by the Group during the vesting period attributable to the number of non-voting
equity securities for which an individual award has been granted. The amount of non-voting equity securities allocated will depend
upon the individual’s salary level, the achievement of performance targets linked to the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (shares and
non-voting equity securities combined) relative to the Group’s peers during the three-year period from the date of the grant, and
the discretion of the Board of Directors. Each award will result in between zero and two non-voting equity securities (before value
adjustment), depending upon the achievement of the performance targets.

Roche Connect. This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the US and certain other countries, to make
regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting equity securities. It is administered by independent third parties. The Group
contributes to the programme, which allows the employees to purchase non-voting equity securities at a discount (usually 20%). The
administrator purchases the necessary non-voting equity securities directly from the market. At 31 December 2014 the administrator held
2.2 million non-voting equity securities (2013: 2.2 million). In 2014 the cost of the plan was 14 million Swiss francs (2013: 11 million Swiss
francs).
Roche Option Plan. This programme is used in countries where S-SARs are not used. Awards under this plan give employees the right
to purchase non-voting equity securities at an exercise price specified at the grant date. The options, which are non-tradable equity-
settled awards, have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years, subject to continued employment.

Bonus Stock Awards. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, Dr. Humer and the Chief Executive Officer will be granted Bonus Stock
Awards in lieu of their cash-settled bonus for the financial year 2014. These will be issued by the end of April 2015. The number of awards
and fair value per award will be calculated at the grant date.
Chugai Stock Acquisition Rights. Chugai has Stock Acquisition Right programmes and the total fair value of the rights issued in 2014
was equivalent to 3 million Swiss francs (2013: 3 million Swiss francs). In 2014, 3,100 rights (2013: 3,270) were issued to employees and
directors of Chugai. The rights are non-tradable equity-settled awards that have a ten-year duration and vest after two years. Each right
entitles the holder to purchase 100 Chugai shares at a specified exercise price. In addition, 461 rights (2013: 522) were issued to the
directors of Chugai that have a thirty-year duration and vest upon the holder’s retirement as a director of Chugai. Each right entitles the
holder to purchase 100 Chugai shares at an exercise price of 100 Japanese yen.

28. Statement of cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities arise from the Group’s primary activities in the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics businesses. These
are calculated by the indirect method by adjusting the Group’s operating profit for any operating income and expenses that are not cash
flows (for example depreciation, amortisation and impairment) in order to derive the cash generated from operations. This and other
operating cash flows are shown in the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flows also include income taxes paid on all activities.

29. Risk management
Group risk management
Risk management is a fundamental element of the Group’s business practice on all levels and encompasses different types of risks.
At a group level risk management is an integral part of the business planning and controlling processes. Material risks are monitored and
regularly discussed with the Corporate Executive Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising from its underlying operations and corporate finance activities. The Group’s
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices as well as
the creditworthiness and the solvency of the Group’s counterparties.
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies reviewed by the boards of directors of Roche or Chugai as
appropriate to their areas of statutory responsibility. These policies cover credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. The policies provide
guidance on risk limits, type of authorised financial instruments and monitoring procedures. As a general principle, the policies prohibit
the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Policy implementation and day-to-day risk management
are carried out by the relevant treasury functions and regular reporting on these risks is performed by the relevant accounting and
controlling functions within Roche and Chugai.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations, causing financial losses for
the Group. The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses of liquid funds deposited with or invested in such
counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering netting agreements and
without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements, is equal to the carrying value of the Group’s financial assets.
Accounts receivable. At 31 December 2014 the Group has trade receivables of 9.7 billion Swiss francs (2013: 9.3 billion Swiss francs).
These are subject to a policy of active credit risk management which focuses on the assessment of country risk, credit availability,
ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures. The objective of trade receivables management is to maximise the
collection of unpaid amounts.
102 | Roche Finance Report 2014Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
At 31 December 2014 the Group’s combined trade receivables balance with three US national wholesale distributors, AmerisourceBergen
Corp., McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health, Inc., was equivalent to 1.9 billion Swiss francs representing 19% of the Group’s consolidated
trade receivables (2013: 1.4 billion Swiss francs representing 15%). There is no other significant concentration of counterparty credit risk
due to the Group’s large number of customers and their wide geographical spread. Risk limits and exposures are continuously monitored
by country and by the nature of counterparties. The Group obtains credit insurance and similar enhancements when appropriate to
protect the collection of trade receivables. At 31 December 2014 no collateral was held for trade receivables (2013: none).
Since 2010 there have been financial difficulties in Southern European countries, notably Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. The Group
is a leading supplier to the healthcare sectors in these countries and has trade receivables of 0.9 billion Swiss francs (2013: 1.3 billion
Swiss francs) with the public customers in these countries. At 31 December 2014 trade receivables in Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal
decreased due to improved collections compared to 2013. The Group uses different measures to improve collections in these countries,
including intense communication with customers, factoring, negotiations of payments plans, charging of interest for late payments, and
legal action.
The nature and geographic location of counterparties to accounts receivable that are not overdue or impaired are shown in the table
below. These include the balances with US national wholesalers and Southern Europe public customers described above.

Cash and marketable securities. At 31 December 2014 the Group has cash and marketable securities of 11.7 billion Swiss francs
(2013: 11.9 billion Swiss francs). These are subject to a policy of restricting exposures to high-quality counterparties and setting defined
limits for individual counterparties. These limits and counterparty credit ratings are reviewed regularly. Investments in marketable
securities are entered into on the basis of guidelines with regard to liquidity, quality and maximum amount. As a general rule, the Group
invests only in high-quality securities with adequate liquidity. Cash and short-term time deposits are subject to rules which limit the
Group’s exposure to individual financial institutions.

Master netting agreements. The Group enters into derivative transactions and collateral agreements under International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements with the respective counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty risk.
Under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same
currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria
for offsetting in the balance sheet as the Group does not have a currently enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, because the
right to offset is only enforceable on the occurrence of future events, such as a default or other credit events.
Contract terms. At 31 December 2014 there are no significant financial assets whose terms have been renegotiated (2013: none).
Impairment losses. During 2014 total impairment losses for available-for-sale financial assets amounted to 9 million Swiss francs
(2013: 9 million Swiss francs).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time. The Group’s
approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements at any point in time.
Roche and Chugai enjoy strong credit quality and are rated by at least one major credit rating agency. The ratings will permit efficient
access to the international capital markets in the event of major financing requirements. At 31 December 2014 the Group has unused
committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling 5.0 billion Swiss francs (2013: 5.1 billion Swiss francs), of which
4.7 billion Swiss francs serve as a back-stop line for the commercial paper programme.

104 | Roche Finance Report 2014Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Market risk
Market risk arises from changing market prices, mainly foreign exchange rates and interest rates, of the Group’s financial assets or
financial liabilities which affect the Group’s financial result and equity.
Value-at-Risk. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to measure the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. VaR indicates the
value range within which a given financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices.
VaR is calculated using a historical simulation approach and for each scenario, all financial instruments are fully valued and the total
change in value and earnings is determined. VaR calculations are based on a 95% confidence level and a holding period of 20 trading
days over the past ten years. This holding period reflects the time required to change the corresponding risk exposure, should this be
deemed appropriate.
Actual future gains and losses associated with our treasury activities may differ materially from the VaR analyses due to the inherent
limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes to interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity investment
prices, particularly in periods of high market volatilities. Furthermore, VaR does not include the effect of changes in credit spreads.

VaR – Foreign exchange component 32 36
VaR – Other price component 36 30
Diversification (56) (61)
VaR – Total market risk 278 297
The interest rate component decreased mainly due to the ageing and restructuring of debt in an environment of largely stable rates
in major economies. The foreign exchange component decreased due to a favourable exposure mix. The other price component arises
mainly from movements in equity security prices and increased as the Group held more equity securities.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group uses the Swiss franc as its reporting currency and as a result is exposed to movements in foreign currencies, mainly the US
dollar, Japanese yen and euro. The objective of the Group’s foreign exchange risk management activities is to preserve the economic
value of its current and future assets and to minimise the volatility of the Group’s financial result. The primary focus of the Group’s foreign
exchange risk management activities is on hedging transaction exposures arising through foreign currency flows or monetary positions
held in foreign currencies. The Group uses forward contracts, foreign exchange options and cross-currency swaps to hedge transaction
exposures. Application of these instruments intends to continuously lock in favourable developments of foreign exchange rates, thereby
reducing the exposure to potential future movements in such rates.
Interest rate risk
The Group mainly raises debt on a fixed rate basis for bonds and notes. The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates, mainly
for its US dollar, Swiss franc and euro-denominated floating rate financial instruments. The primary objective of the Group’s interest
rate management is to protect the net interest result. The Group may use forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge its interest
rate exposures. Depending on the interest rate environment of major currencies, the Group will use these instruments to generate an
appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposures.
Interest rate hedging. During 2014 the Group entered into the following interest rate hedging contracts:
Interest rate swap contracts for a combined notional principal of 850 million US dollars. These swapped the fixed interest rate of
1.35% to an effective floating interest rate of 3 months USD-LIBOR plus an average spread of 0.088%. The maturity of the swaps is
29 September 2017.
Interest rate swap contracts for a combined notional principal of 1.5 billion Swiss francs. These swapped the fixed interest rate of
2.25% to an effective floating interest rate of 3 months USD-LIBOR plus an average spread of 0.31%. The maturity of the swaps is
30 September 2019.
Roche Finance Report 2014 | 105Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Other price risk
Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities. The Group manages the price risk through placing limits
on individual and total equity investments. These limits are defined both as a percentage of total liquid funds and as an absolute number
for individual equity investments.
Capital management
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total capitalisation, being the sum of debt plus equity, including non-
controlling interests. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide benefits for patients and returns to
investors.
To provide an adequate return to investors based on the level of risk undertaken.
To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver future benefits for patients and
returns to investors.
To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The capitalisation is reported to senior management as part of the Group’s regular internal management reporting and is shown in
the table below.

Capitalisation 47,272 39,884 41,340
The Group’s net equity was significantly impacted by the 2009 Genentech transaction (see Note 21).
The Group is not subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements as known in the financial services industry. The Group has a
majority shareholding in Chugai (see Note 22). Chugai is a public company and its objectives, policies and processes for managing its
own capital are determined by local management.

present value of the future cash flows on the instrument, discounted at a market rate of interest for instruments with similar credit status,
cash flows and maturity periods.

Level 1 financial assets consist of treasury bills, bonds and quoted shares. Level 2 financial assets consist primarily of commercial paper,
certificates of deposit and derivative financial instruments.
The Group determines Level 2 fair values using the following valuation techniques:
Marketable securities and derivative financial instruments are based on valuation models that use observable market data for interest
rates, yield curves, foreign exchange rates and implied volatilities for similar instruments at the measurement date.
Available-for-sale investments using a valuation model derived from the most recently published observable financial prices.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period during which the transfer
has occurred. There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and vice versa during the year (2013: none).

Contingent consideration arrangements
The Group is party to certain contingent consideration arrangements arising from business combinations. The fair values are determined
considering the expected payments, discounted to present value using risk-adjusted average discount rate of 4.1% (2013: 4.6%).
The expected payments are determined by considering the possible scenarios of forecast sales and other performance criteria, the
amount to be paid under each scenario, and the probability of each scenario. The significant unobservable inputs are the forecast sales,
other performance criteria and the risk-adjusted discount rate. The estimated fair value would increase if the forecast sales or other
performance criteria rate was higher or the risk-adjusted discount rate was lower. At 31 December 2014 the total payments under
contingent consideration arrangements could be up to 2,203 million Swiss francs (2013: 303 million Swiss francs). The most significant
contingent consideration arrangements relate to the Seragon (2014), Santaris (2014), Dutalys (2014), IQuum (2014), Genia (2014) and
CMI (2013) acquisitions.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group has entered into various currency swaps for certain non-US dollar debt instruments. Cash collateral agreements were entered
into with the counterparties to the currency swaps to mitigate counterparty risk. The following table sets out the carrying value of
derivative financial instruments and the amounts that are subject to master netting agreements.

Hedge accounting
At 31 December 2014 the Group has the following cash flow hedges and fair value hedges which are designated in a qualifying hedge
relationship.
Cash flow hedges. The Group has entered into cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk on some of
the bonds and notes issued by the Group which are denominated in euros and sterling. At 31 December 2014 such instruments are
recorded as fair value assets of 76 million Swiss francs and liabilities of 145 million Swiss francs (2013: assets of 513 million Swiss francs).
There was no ineffective portion.
Chugai has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a part of its foreign translation exposure to Swiss francs and
US dollars. At 31 December 2014 such instruments are recorded as fair value assets of 14 million Swiss francs (2013: assets of 57 million
Swiss francs). There was no ineffective portion.
The expected undiscounted cash flows from qualifying cash flow hedges, including interest payments during the duration of the derivative
contract and final settlement on maturity, are shown in the table below.

31 December 2014 such instruments are recorded as fair value liabilities of 34 million Swiss francs (2013: 59 million Swiss francs) and
fair value assets of 19 million Swiss francs (2013: 2 million Swiss francs). During 2014 a gain of 42 million Swiss francs was recorded
on these interest rate swaps (2013: loss of 62 million Swiss francs). As the fair value hedge had been highly effective since inception,
the result of the interest rate swaps was largely offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt instruments.
110 | Roche Finance Report 2014Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
The Group has equity investments in various biotechnology companies that are subject to a greater risk of market fluctuation than
the stock market in general. To manage part of this exposure the Group has entered into forward contracts, which have been designated
and qualify as fair value hedges. At 31 December 2014 such instruments are recorded as fair value liabilities of 384 million Swiss francs
(2013: liabilities of 270 million Swiss francs). During 2014 a loss of 114 million Swiss francs was recorded on these forward contracts
(2013: loss of 164 million Swiss francs). The result of the forward contracts is offset by the changes in the fair value of the hedged equity
investments held within marketable securities (see Note 12).
Net investment hedges. The Group does not have any net investment hedges.

116 | Roche Finance Report 2014Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
32. Significant accounting policies
Consolidation policy
Subsidiaries are all companies (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when
the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns
through its power over the entity. Companies acquired during the year are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to
the Group, and subsidiaries to be divested are included up to the date on which control passes from the Group. Inter-company balances,
transactions and resulting unrealised income are eliminated in full. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for
as equity transactions if they occur after control has already been obtained and if they do not result in a loss of control. Associates are
companies over which the Group exercises, or has the power to exercise, significant influence, but which it does not control and they are
accounted for using the equity method.
Segment reporting
For the purpose of segment reporting the Group’s Corporate Executive Committee (CEC) is considered to be the Group’s Chief Operating
Decision Maker. The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the organisation units for which information is reported
to the CEC on a regular basis. The information provided is used as the basis of the segment revenue and profit disclosures reported in
Note 2, with the geographic analysis based on the location of customers. Selected segment balance sheet information is also routinely
provided to the CEC.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis. Operating assets and liabilities consist of property, plant
and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade receivables/payables, inventories and other assets and liabilities, such as provisions,
which can be reasonably attributed to the reported operating segments. Non-operating assets and liabilities mainly include current
and deferred income tax balances, post-employment benefit assets/liabilities and financial assets/liabilities such as cash, marketable
securities, investments and debt.
Foreign currency translation
The Annual Financial Statements are presented in Swiss francs. Most Group companies use their local currency as their functional
currency. Certain Group companies use other currencies (such as US dollars, Swiss francs or euros) as their functional currency where
this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Local transactions in other currencies are initially
reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses from the settlement of such transactions and gains
and losses on translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are included in income, except when they
are qualifying cash flow hedges or arise on monetary items that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign entity.
In such cases the gains and losses are deferred into other comprehensive income.
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using functional currencies other than Swiss francs are translated into
Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange. The income statement and statement of cash flows are translated at the average rates
of exchange for the year. Translation differences due to the changes in exchange rates between the beginning and the end of the year
and the difference between net income translated at the average and year-end exchange rates are taken directly to other comprehensive
income.
Roche Finance Report 2014 | 117Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Revenues
Sales represent amounts received and receivable for goods supplied to customers after deducting trade discounts, cash discounts
and volume rebates, and exclude value added taxes and other taxes directly linked to sales. Revenues from the sale of products are
recognised upon transfer to the customer of significant risks and rewards. Trade discounts, cash discounts and volume rebates are
recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of the related sales. Estimates of expected sales returns, charge-backs
and other rebates, including Medicaid in the US and similar rebates in other countries, are also deducted from sales and recorded as
accrued liabilities or provisions or as a deduction from accounts receivable. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual
or legislatively mandated obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience. If the circumstances are such that the level of sales
returns, and hence revenues, cannot be reliably measured, then sales are only recognised when the right of return expires, which is
generally upon prescription of the products to patients. Other revenues are recorded as earned or as the services are performed. Single
transactions are split into separately identifiable components to reflect the substance of the transaction, where necessary. Conversely,
two or more transactions may be considered together for revenue recognition purposes, where the commercial effect cannot be
understood without reference to the series of transactions as a whole.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and related production overheads of goods sold and services rendered.
Royalties, alliance and collaboration expenses, including all collaboration profit-sharing arrangements are also reported as part of cost
of sales. Start-up costs between validation and the achievement of normal production capacity are expensed as incurred.
Research and development
Internal research and development activities are expensed as incurred for the following:
Internal research costs incurred for the purpose of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.
Internal development costs incurred for the application of research findings or other knowledge to plan and develop new products
for commercial production. The development projects undertaken by the Group are subject to technical, regulatory and other
uncertainties, such that, in the opinion of management, the criteria for capitalisation as intangible assets are not met prior to obtaining
marketing approval by the regulatory authorities in major markets.
Post-marketing studies after regulatory approval, such as phase IV costs in the pharmaceuticals business, generally involve safety
surveillance and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives marketing approval to be sold. They may be required by
regulatory authorities or may be undertaken for safety or commercial reasons. The costs of such post-marketing studies are not
capitalised as intangible assets, as in the opinion of management, they do not generate separately identifiable incremental future
economic benefits that can be reliably measured.
Acquired in-process research and development resources obtained through in-licensing arrangements, business combinations or
separate asset purchases are capitalised as intangible assets. The acquired asset must be controlled by the Group, be separately
identifiable and expected to generate future economic benefits, even if uncertainty exists as to whether the research and development
will ultimately result in a marketable product. Consequently, upfront and milestone payments to third parties for pharmaceutical products
or compounds before regulatory marketing approval are recognised as intangible assets. Assets acquired through such arrangements
are measured on the basis set out in the ‘Intangible assets’ policy. Subsequent internal research and development costs incurred post-
acquisition are treated in the same way as other internal research and development costs. If research and development are embedded
in contracts for strategic alliances, the Group carefully assesses whether upfront or milestone payments constitute funding of research
and development work or acquisition of an asset.
Licensing, milestone and other upfront receipts
Royalty income is recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the respective licensing agreements. If the
collectability of a royalty amount is not reasonably assured, those royalties are recognised as revenue when the cash is received. Certain
Group companies receive upfront, milestone and other similar payments from third parties relating to the sale or licensing of products
or technology. Revenue associated with performance milestones is recognised based on achievement of the deliverables as defined
in the respective agreements. Upfront payments and licence fees for which there are subsequent deliverables are initially reported
as deferred income and are recognised in income as earned over the period of the development collaboration or the manufacturing
obligation.

Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits include wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, profit sharing and
bonuses, and non-monetary benefits for current employees. The costs are recognised within the operating results when the employee
has rendered the associated service. The Group recognises a liability for profit sharing and bonuses where contractually obliged or
where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Long-term employee benefits include long-service or sabbatical leave, long-service benefits and long-term disability benefits.
The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment. Any changes in the carrying value of other long-term
employee benefit liabilities are recognised within the operating results.
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. Termination costs are recognised at the earlier of when
the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of the benefits or when the Group recognises any related restructuring costs.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
For defined contribution plans the Group contributions are recognised within the operating results when the employee has rendered
the associated service. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future
payments is available.
For defined benefit plans the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair
value of the plan assets. All changes in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as they occur as follows:
Recognised in the income statement:
Current service costs are charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results.
Past service costs, including curtailment gains or losses, are recognised immediately in general and administration within the operating
results.
Settlement gains or losses are recognised in general and administration within the operating results.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is recognised in financing costs.
Recognised in other comprehensive income:
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments (the difference between previous assumptions and what has actually
occurred) and changes in actuarial assumptions.
The return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability.
Any change in the limit on the recognition of plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is comprised of interest income on plan assets, interest cost on the defined benefit
obligation and interest on the effect of the limit on the recognition of pension assets. The net interest is calculated using the same
discount rate that is used in calculating the defined benefit obligation, applied to the net defined liability at the start of the period, taking
account of any changes from contribution or benefit payments.
Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to use
the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan.
Equity compensation plans
The fair value of all equity compensation awards granted to employees is estimated at the grant date and recorded as an expense over
the vesting period. The expense is charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results. For equity-settled
plans, an increase in equity is recorded for this expense and any subsequent cash flows from exercises of vested awards are recorded
as changes in equity.
Roche Finance Report 2014 | 119Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction, and include all costs directly attributable to
bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
These include items such as costs of site preparation, installation and assembly costs and professional fees. The net costs of testing
whether the asset is functioning properly, including validation costs, are also included in the initially recorded cost of construction.
Interest and other borrowing costs incurred with respect to qualifying assets are capitalised and included in the carrying value of the
assets. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis, except for land, which is not depreciated. The estimated
useful lives of major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
Land improvements 40 years
Buildings 10–50 years
Machinery and equipment 4–15 years
Diagnostic instruments 3–5 years
Office equipment 3–6 years
Motor vehicles 5–8 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate components.
The estimated useful lives of the assets are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation charges are accelerated. Repairs
and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Leases
Where the Group is the lessee. Finance leases exist when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the
Group. Finance leases are capitalised at the start of the lease at fair value, or the present value of the minimum lease payments, if lower.
The rental obligation, net of finance charges, is reported within debt. Finance lease assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease
term and its useful life. The interest element of the lease payment is charged against income over the lease term based on the effective
interest rate method. Operating leases exist when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group.
Payments made under operating leases are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where the Group is the lessor. Certain assets, mainly Diagnostics instruments, are leased to third parties through both finance and
operating lease arrangements. Finance lease assets are reported as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease.
Lease income from finance leases is recognised over the term of the lease based on the effective interest rate method. Operating lease
assets are reported within property, plant and equipment. Lease income from operating leases is recognised over the lease term on a
straight-line basis.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. At the date of acquisition the Group initially
recognises the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired
business. The consideration transferred is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. Where the Group does not acquire 100%
ownership of the acquired business, non-controlling interests are recorded either at fair value or as the proportion of the fair value
of the acquired net assets attributable to the non-controlling interest. Directly attributable acquisition-related costs are expensed as
incurred within general and administration expenses.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises in a business combination and is the excess of the consideration transferred to acquire the business over the underlying
fair value of the net identified assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually and upon the
occurrence of an indication of impairment.
120 | Roche Finance Report 2014Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Intangible assets
Purchased patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Assets that have been acquired
through a business combination are initially recorded at fair value. Once available for use, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-
line basis over their useful lives. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date. The estimated useful life is the
lower of the legal duration and the economic useful life. The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are regularly reviewed. Estimated
useful lives of major classes of amortisable intangible assets are as follows:
Product intangibles in use up to 20 years
Marketing intangibles in use up to 5 years
Technology intangibles in use up to 14 years
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
An impairment assessment is carried out when there is evidence that an asset may be impaired. In addition intangible assets that are not
yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. When the recoverable amount of an asset, being the higher of its fair value less
costs to sell and its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value is reduced to its recoverable amount. This reduction
is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. Value in use is calculated using estimated cash flows, generally over a five-
year period, with extrapolating projections for subsequent years. These are discounted using an appropriate long-term interest rate.
When an impairment loss arises, the useful life of the asset is reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation/amortisation charge is
accelerated. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring
after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement as an
impairment reversal.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is assessed for impairment at each reporting date and is additionally tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is allocated to
cash-generating units and when the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, being the higher of its fair value less costs to sell or
its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value of the goodwill is reduced to its recoverable amount. This reduction
is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. When an acquired business, that is included within a cash-generating unit,
permanently ceases to operate then it is treated as a disposal of that business. For separately identifiable goodwill that was generated
on the initial acquisition of that business and where all of the factors that made up that goodwill are entirely unrelated to the continuing
operations of the cash-generating unit, then the goodwill is deemed to have been disposed of and is fully impaired. The impairment
testing methodology is further described in Note 8.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods and work in process includes raw
materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs and overheads based upon the normal capacity of production facilities.
Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to completion
and selling expenses.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts, trade discounts, cash
discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded where there is objective evidence that
the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. These estimates are based on specific indicators, such as the ageing of customer
balances, specific credit circumstances and the Group’s historical experience, taking also into account economic conditions. Expenses
for doubtful trade receivables are recognised within marketing and distribution expenses. Trade discounts, cash discounts, volume
rebates and similar allowances are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of the related sales, using estimates
based on existing contractual obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience.
Roche Finance Report 2014 | 121Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and time, call and current balances with banks and similar institutions. Such balances
are only reported as cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes
in their fair value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to an outflow of resources
that can be reliably estimated. In particular, restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan that has
either commenced implementation or has been announced. Provisions are recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to
arise and are discounted when the time value of money is material. A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation
will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability. Contingent
assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Fair values
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices or by the use of established valuation
techniques such as option pricing models and the discounted cash flow method if quoted prices in an active market are not available.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are classified into the following categories which are disclosed in Note 29.
Available-for-sale. These are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated as such or are not classified in any other
financial asset category. Available-for-sale assets are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Changes in fair value are
recorded in other comprehensive income, except for impairments and interest and foreign exchange components. When an investment
is derecognised, the cumulative gains and losses in equity are reclassified to financial income (expense). Available-for-sale assets are
mainly comprised of marketable securities.
Fair value – hedging instruments. These are derivative financial instruments that are used to manage the exposures to foreign currency,
interest rate, equity market and credit risks. Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value.
Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, all changes in fair value are recorded as other
financial income (expense).
Fair value – designated. These are non-derivative financial instruments that are designated as fair value through profit or loss on initial
recognition. Designated fair value instruments are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value with changes in fair value
recorded in the income statement. Designated fair value instruments are mainly comprised of contingent consideration liabilities with
changes in fair value recorded in general and administration within the operating results.
Loans and receivables. These are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. Loans and receivables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest
rate method, less any impairment losses. Loans and receivables are mainly comprised of accounts receivable and cash and cash
equivalents.
Other financial liabilities. These are non-derivative financial liabilities. Other financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value and
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Other financial liabilities are mainly comprised of debt
and trade payables.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual cash flows from the asset expire or when the Group transfers the rights to receive
the contractual cash flows from the financial assets in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the
financial asset are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when the contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
122 | Roche Finance Report 2014Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are individually assessed for possible impairment at each reporting date. An impairment charge is recorded where there
is objective evidence of impairment, such as where the issuer is in bankruptcy, default or other significant financial difficulty. Available-
for-sale equity securities that have a market value of more than 25% below their original cost, or have a market value below their original
cost for a sustained six-month period will be considered as impaired.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, any impairment charge is the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable
amount, calculated using estimated future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate. For available-for-sale financial
assets, any impairment charge is the amount currently carried in other comprehensive income for the difference between the original
cost and the fair value.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
For debt securities measured at amortised cost or available-for-sale, the reversal is recognised in income. For equity securities held as
available-for-sale, the reversal is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Hedge accounting
The Group uses derivatives to manage its exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. The instruments
used may include interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, forwards contracts and options. The Group generally limits the use of
hedge accounting to certain significant transactions. To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict
conditions on documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. While many of these
transactions can be considered as hedges in economic terms, if the required conditions are not met, then the relationship does not
qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no
hedging relationship, which means that any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial income
(expense).
Cash flow hedge. This is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a
recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss. The hedging instrument is recorded
at fair value. The effective portion of the hedge is included in other comprehensive income and any ineffective portion is reported in
financial income (expense). If the hedging relationship is the hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment or highly probable
forecasted transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging
instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying value of the non-financial item at
the date of recognition. For all other cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been
recorded in other comprehensive income are included in financial income (expense) when the forecasted transaction affects net income.
Fair value hedge. This is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or an unrecognised firm
commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect
profit or loss. The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item is recorded at its previous carrying value, adjusted for
any changes in fair value that are attributable to the hedged risk. Changes in the fair values are reported in financial income (expense).
Debt
Debt instruments are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Subsequently they are reported
at amortised cost. Any discount between the net proceeds received and the principal value due on redemption is amortised over the
duration of the debt instrument and is recognised as part of financing costs using the effective interest rate method.
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding taxes payable on the distribution of
retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based on income, such as property and capital taxes, are included within general and
administration expenses.
Liabilities for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally relating to
subsidiaries, are only recognised where it is probable that such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future.
Roche Finance Report 2014 | 123Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
carrying values. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the same taxation authority and when there
is a legally enforceable right to offset them. Deferred taxes are determined based on the currently enacted tax rates applicable in each
tax jurisdiction where the Group operates.
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The original purchase cost, consideration
received for subsequent resale of these equity instruments and other movements are reported as changes in equity. These instruments
are held for the Group’s potential conversion obligations that may arise from the Group’s equity compensation plans.
Changes in accounting policies
The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential amendments to other
standards, with a date of initial application of 1 January 2014.
Investment Entities (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27)
Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Amendments to IAS 32)
Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets (Amendments to IAS 36)
Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting (Amendments to IAS 39)
IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’
These do not have a material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position.
Future new and revised standards
The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of the various new and revised standards and interpretations that will be
mandatory from 1 January 2015 which the Group has not yet applied. Based on the analysis to date, the Group does not anticipate that
these will have a material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position. The Group is also assessing other new and revised
standards which are not mandatory until after 2015, notably IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ and IFRS 15 ‘Revenues from Contracts with
Customers’.
33. Subsequent events
On 15 January 2015 the Swiss National Bank announced that it was discontinuing the minimum exchange rate of 1.20 Swiss francs per
euro. The amounts reported in these Annual Financial Statements do not reflect changes in foreign exchange rates after 31 December
2014. Since the Group uses the Swiss franc as the presentation currency in its consolidated financial statements, then a weakening
of foreign currencies against the Swiss franc will have a negative currency translation impact on the Group’s consolidated results when
reported in Swiss francs.
At the date of approval of the Annual Financial Statements changes in foreign exchange rates had not caused material foreign exchange
transaction gains or losses in the Group’s results for 2015. The Group’s foreign exchange risk management is disclosed in Note 29 and
the currency translation sensitivity of the Group’s results to movements in foreign currency exchange rates is included in the Financial
Review on pages 29 to 30.

Report of Roche Management on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate control over
financial reporting. The internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance over the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2014 based on the
criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework version 2013 issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has
concluded that the system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 31 December 2014.
The Statutory Auditor KPMG AG has audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended 31 December
2014, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA). They have also issued a
report on the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control over financial reporting. This report is set out on page 127.

Report of the Statutory Auditor on
the Consolidated Financial Statements
Report of the Statutory Auditor to the General Meeting of Shareholders of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
As statutory auditor, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, which comprise
the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, statement of changes in equity and
notes on pages 40 to 124 for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Board of Directors’ Responsibility. The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the requirements of Swiss law. This responsibility includes
designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of consolidated financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and
applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s Responsibility. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, Swiss Auditing Standards and International Standards on Auditing. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the consolidated financial statements are
free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the
internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 give a true and fair view of
the financial position, the results of operations and the cash flows in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),
and comply with Swiss law.
Report on Other Legal Requirements
We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA) and independence
(article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence.
In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists,
which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.
We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

Report of the Independent Auditor on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of the Independent Auditor on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
to the Board of Directors of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
We have examined the Roche Group’s system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2014, based on criteria
established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework version 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as included in the accompanying Report
of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our examination. An entity’s internal control over financial reporting is a process effected by
the entity’s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and includes those policies
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of the unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that
could have a material effect on the entity’s financial statements.
We conducted our examination in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000). This
standard requires that we plan and perform our examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our examination included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of management override of
controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that internal control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or because the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Roche Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December
2014 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework version 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and International Standards on Auditing, the consolidated financial
statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended 31 December 2014 and our report dated 26 January 2015 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Roche Finance Report 2014 | 131Roche Group | Multi-Year Overview and Supplementary Information
Supplementary Core results and EPS information
The Group’s basic and diluted earnings per share is given in Note 27 to the Annual Financial Statements. To allow for a transparent
assessment of both the actual results and the underlying performance of the business the full income statement for the Group and
the operating results of the Divisions are shown on both an IFRS and core basis.
The core results concept, which is used in the internal management of the business, is based on the IFRS results, with the following
adjustments:
Global restructuring plans (see Note 6) are excluded.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (see Note 9) and impairment of goodwill (see Note 8) are excluded.
Acquisition accounting and other one-time impacts from Alliance arrangements and Business Combinations (see Financial Review)
are excluded.
Discontinued operations (currently none) would be excluded.
Legal and environmental expenses (see Financial Review) are excluded.
Global issues outside the healthcare sector beyond the Group’s control (currently none) would be excluded.
Material one-time treasury items such as major debt restructurings (see Note 20) are excluded.
Pension plan settlements (see Note 25) are excluded.
The tax benefit recorded under IFRS in respect of Equity Compensation Plans (ECPs), which varies according to price of the underlying
equity, is replaced by a normalised tax benefit, being the IFRS 2 expense multiplied by the applicable tax rate (see Note 4).
The core results concept was further described on 22 October 2010 at an Investor Update teleconference, which is available for
download at: http://www.roche.com/investors/ir_agenda/csr_151010.htm
The Group’s IFRS results, including the Divisional breakdown, are reconciled to the core results in the tables below. The calculation of
core EPS is also given in the tables below. Additional commentary to the adjustment items is given in the Financial Review.

The major participations of the company are listed in Note 31 to the Roche Group Annual Financial Statements.
Valuation methods and translation of foreign currencies
Marketable securities and own equity instruments are reported at the lower of cost or market value. All other assets, including
participations, are reported at cost less appropriate write-downs. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated

of the share capital and confer no voting rights. However, each non-voting equity security confers the same rights as any of the shares to
participate in the available earnings and in any remaining proceeds from liquidation following repayment of the nominal value of the share
capital and, if any, participation certificates.

Report of the Statutory Auditor
on the Financial Statements
Report of the Statutory Auditor to the General Meeting of Shareholders of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
As statutory auditor, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, which comprise the income statement,
balance sheet and notes on pages 141 to 148 for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Board of Directors’ Responsibility. The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance
with the requirements of Swiss law and the company’s Articles of Incorporation. This responsibility includes designing, implementing
and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies
and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s Responsibility. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our
audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control
system relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control system. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 comply with Swiss law and the company’s
Articles of Incorporation.
Report on Other Legal Requirements
We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA) and independence
(article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence.
In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control system
exists, which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.
We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the company’s Articles of
Incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

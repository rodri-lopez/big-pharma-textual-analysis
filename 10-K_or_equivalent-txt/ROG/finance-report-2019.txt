CER (Constant Exchange Rates): The percentage changes at constant exchange rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the 2019 and 2018 results at constant
exchange rates (the average rates for the year ended 31 December 2018). For the definition of CER see page 168.
Core results and Core EPS (earnings per share): These exclude non-core items such as global restructuring plans and amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
This allows an assessment of both the actual results and the underlying performance of the business. A full income statement for the Group and the operating results of the divisions
are shown on both an IFRS and core basis. The core concept is fully described on pages 161–164 and reconciliations between the IFRS and core results are given there.
Free cash flow is used to assess the Group’s ability to generate the cash required to conduct and maintain its operations. It also indicates the Group’s ability to generate cash
to finance dividend payments, repay debt and to undertake merger and acquisition activities. The free cash flow concept is used in the internal management of the business.

Roche in 2019
The Roche Group reported strong overall results in 2019. Sales grew by 9% at constant exchange rates (CER). IFRS net income increased
by 32% (CER) and core earnings per share increased by 13% (CER).
Sales
Group sales increased by 9% (CER) to CHF 61.5 billion (8% growth in CHF terms).
Pharmaceuticals sales growth was 11% (CER) due to the new medicines Ocrevus, Hemlibra, Tecentriq and Perjeta. In oncology, in addition
to Tecentriq, there was continued growth in the HER2 franchise and Avastin. Biosimilars had an estimated negative impact of CHF 1.5 billion
on 2019 sales. Immunology sales increased, led by Actemra/RoActemra and Esbriet.
Diagnostics sales showed growth of 3% (CER) with the immunodiagnostics business being the major contributor.
Operating results
Core operating profit increased by 11% (CER) to CHF 22.5 billion (10% increase in CHF terms).
Research and development expenditure grew by 6% (CER) to CHF 11.7 billion on a core basis, with focus on the oncology, neuroscience
and immunology therapeutic areas. Research and development costs represented 19.0% of Group sales.
IFRS operating results include non-core expenses (pre-tax) of CHF 5.0 billion. The major factors were CHF 1.5 billion amortisation charges
for intangible assets, CHF 1.8 billion impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, notably CHF 0.8 billion relating to the Diabetes Care business.
Non-operating results
Financing costs (IFRS) increased by 28% to CHF 1.0 billion due to early debt redemption losses of CHF 0.2 billion.
Income tax expenses (IFRS) decreased by 23% at CER to CHF 2.5 billion. The effective core tax rate for 2019 decreased to 16.3% mainly due
to the impacts from the resolution of several tax disputes.
Net income
IFRS net income increased by 32% at CER to CHF 14.1 billion (+30% in CHF terms) due to the base effect of high goodwill impairment in 2018.
Core earnings per share increased by 13% at CER to CHF 20.16 (+11% in CHF terms).
Cash flows
Operating free cash flow increased to CHF 20.9 billion. The underlying cash generation led to an increase of operating free cash flow of 11%
at CER (+12% in CHF terms).
Free cash flow increased by 12% at CER (+13% in CHF terms) to CHF 16.8 billion, driven by the higher operating free cash flow.
Financial position
Net working capital decreased by 16% (CER) driven by the Pharmaceuticals Division.
Net debt decreased by CHF 3.1 billion to CHF 2.5 billion. The free cash flow more than covered the dividends and the CHF 4.6 billion net cash
payments for Spark Therapeutics. Gross debt decreased by 22% (CER) to CHF 14.4 billion.
Credit ratings strong: Moody’s at Aa3 and Standard & Poor’s at AA.
Shareholder return
Dividends. A proposal will be made to increase dividends by 3% to CHF 9.00 per share. This would represent the 33rd consecutive year of
dividend growth and would result in a pay-out ratio of 44.6%, subject to AGM approval.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) was 33% representing the combined performance of share and non-voting equity security.Roche Group

In 2019 the Roche Group reported sales growth of 9% at constant exchange rates (CER) and this led to core operating profit growth
of 11% and an increase in Core EPS of 13%. IFRS net income increased by 32% due to this business growth and the base impact of the
high goodwill impairments in 2018. The sales growth continued to be driven by the Pharmaceuticals Division’s new medicines, which
more than compensated for biosimilar competition. The Group further improved its operating profitability, while continuing its investments
in research and development and supporting the launch of new products. Operating free cash flow was CHF 20.9 billion, an increase of
11%, driven by the higher cash generation of the pharmaceuticals business.

Roche Finance Report 2019 | 3Roche Group | Financial Review
Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division were CHF 48.5 billion (2018: CHF 44.0 billion), an increase of 11% at CER. New products were
the major growth driver, with Ocrevus, Hemlibra, Tecentriq and Perjeta together contributing an additional CHF 4.4 billion (CER) of new
sales. This more than offset the estimated CHF 1.5 billion (CER) impact of biosimilars on sales in Europe, Japan and, from the second
half of 2019, the US. Broader market penetration led to a 36% sales increase in China to CHF 3.1 billion. Ocrevus sales were 57% higher at
CHF 3.7 billion, led by the US. The launch and rollouts of Hemlibra continued with sales reaching CHF 1.4 billion. Tecentriq sales grew in
all regions, with the largest contributions coming from higher demand in the US and Europe as well as newly launched indications. Perjeta
sales were CHF 3.5 billion, an increase of 29%, with growth across all regions. Avastin sales were 4% higher mainly due to growth in
China and the US. In Europe and Japan, sales of MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin fell by CHF 1.2 billion (CER) in 2019 due to biosimilar
competition. In the US, the first biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin came to market in the second half of
2019, and had an estimated CHF 0.3 billion (CER) impact on sales. The Diagnostics Division reported sales of CHF 12.9 billion, an increase
of 3% at CER. The major growth area was Centralised and Point of Care Solutions, which represented 60% of the division’s sales
and which grew by 3%, led by growth in the immunodiagnostics business of 6%. Molecular Diagnostics sales increased by 6% due to
increased demand in blood screening. Diabetes Care sales increased by 1% driven by the Accu-Chek Guide product line in North America.
The Pharmaceuticals Division’s core operating profit increased by 12% at CER, ahead of the sales growth. Royalty and other operating
income decreased by CHF 0.4 billion in total, with a fall of CHF 0.7 billion following the expiry of the Cabilly patent at the end of 2018,
partially offset by product disposal gains and higher profit-share income. Cost of sales increased by 7%, below the sales growth, with
manufacturing costs growing 3% due to a favourable product mix and lower inventory write-offs, and royalty expenses growing 33%.
Marketing and distribution costs grew by 10% due to increased spending on product launches and rollouts including Tecentriq, Ocrevus
and Xofluza as well as ramp-up of marketing activities in new strategic businesses. Research and development costs grew by 6%,
with oncology, neuroscience and immunology representing significant areas of spending.
In the Diagnostics Division core operating profit increased by 1% at CER, behind the 3% sales growth. Cost of sales grew by 6% due
to higher costs from external suppliers and for technical and engineering services. Research and development increased by 1% due to
spending on new projects within the Centralised and Point of Care Solutions portfolio and on laboratory automation.
IFRS operating profit increased by 23% in the Pharmaceuticals Division and fell by 46% in the Diagnostics Division, with the results of
both divisions impacted by impairments of goodwill and intangible assets in both the current year and the comparative period. The 2019
results include CHF 1.8 billion of these impairments, with the largest item being the goodwill impairment of CHF 0.8 billion relating to the
Diabetes Care business. Impairments of goodwill and intangible assets in 2018 were CHF 3.3 billion, including CHF 1.8 billion relating to
the InterMune acquisition. Amortisation of intangible assets was CHF 1.5 billion and there were CHF 1.2 billion of expenses from global
restructuring plans.
Operating free cash flow was CHF 20.9 billion, an increase of 11% at CER, due to higher cash generation of the pharmaceuticals business
and lower capital expenditure, partly offset by higher investments in intangible assets. Net working capital decreased compared to 2018
driven by the Pharmaceuticals Division with higher rebate and chargeback accruals and lower net trade working capital. The free cash
flow was CHF 16.8 billion, an increase of CHF 2.0 billion, mainly due to the higher operating free cash flow.
Financing costs were 28% (CER) higher on an IFRS basis at CHF 1.0 billion mainly due to losses on early debt redemption of CHF 0.2 billion
in 2019. Net income from equity securities showed gains of CHF 0.2 billion from Roche Venture Fund investments. Income tax expenses
were lower, with the Group’s effective core tax rate at 16.3% compared to 19.7% in 2018. This was mainly due to the impacts from the
resolution of several tax disputes, which had an impact of 2.1 percentage points on the effective core tax rate in 2019. The implementation
of the Swiss tax reform in 2019 had a non-core transitional impact on the Group’s deferred tax positions of CHF 0.2 billion, which had no
impact on tax payments in 2019.
Net income increased by 32% at CER on an IFRS basis to CHF 14.1 billion and by 14% on a core basis to CHF 18.1 billion, driven in both
cases by the operating results. The IFRS net income was additionally affected by the base impact of significant goodwill impairments in 2018.
The results expressed in Swiss francs were negatively impacted by the stronger Swiss franc on average against the euro and Latin American
currencies, partly offset by the appreciation of the US dollar against the Swiss franc. There was a 1 percentage point impact on sales
and core operating profit expressed in Swiss francs compared to constant exchange rates and a 2 percentage point impact on Core EPS.

Roche Finance Report 2019 | 5Roche Group | Financial Review
Leases
Effective 1 January 2019 the Group has implemented IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance, including IAS 17 ‘Leases’.
The Group applied the cumulative catch-up method option for the transition, meaning that the comparative 2018 results have not been
restated. Further details are given in Note 28 to the Annual Financial Statements.
The main impact of the new standard is to bring operating leases onto the balance sheet. The new standard results in the carrying value
of leased assets (‘right-of-use assets’) increasing by CHF 1.2 billion as of 1 January 2019, with lease liabilities increasing by a similar amount.
These leases represent primarily office facilities and motor vehicles. The application of the new standard results in part of what has been
previously reported as operating lease costs being recorded as interest expenses. Given the leases involved and the prevailing low interest
rate environment, the Group does not currently expect this effect to be material, with the amount in 2019 being CHF 18 million.
The application of the new standard does not materially impact the Group’s Alternative Performance Measures. There are classification
changes within Core EPS and operating free cash flow, but the totals are largely unaffected, while the Group’s definition of net debt does
not include lease liabilities. The new standard does have an impact on EBITDA. Further details are given on pages 161 to 168.
Mergers and acquisitions
On 17 December 2019 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Spark Therapeutics, Inc. (‘Spark Therapeutics’), a publicly
owned US company based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that had been listed on Nasdaq Stock Market. Spark Therapeutics is a fully
integrated commercial company committed to discovering, developing and delivering gene therapies. Spark Therapeutics is reported
in the Pharmaceuticals Division. The cash purchase consideration was USD 4.8 billion (equivalent to CHF 4.7 billion). During 2019
there was CHF 146 million of non-core income from the reversal of contingent consideration provisions. Further details are given in
Notes 6 and 31 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Global restructuring plans
During 2019 the Group continued with the implementation of various global restructuring plans initiated in prior years.

6 | Roche Finance Report 2019Financial Review | Roche Group
Diagnostics Division. Strategy plans in the Diagnostics Division incurred costs of CHF 228 million mainly for employee-related matters.
Expenses for IT process optimisation plans were CHF 71 million.
Site consolidation. Costs from the Pharmaceuticals Division’s strategic realignment of its manufacturing network were CHF 132 million
and mainly related to the exit from the manufacturing site at Clarecastle, Ireland. The expected costs of the environmental remediation
at the Clarecastle site were reassessed and resulted in an increase in the provisions by CHF 43 million. Employee-related costs of
CHF 91 million were recorded for the redesign of manufacturing at the South San Francisco site. Costs for the resourcing flexibility plan
in the biologics manufacturing network were CHF 84 million, which included the closure of the manufacturing plant in Rio de Janeiro
in Brazil.
Other global restructuring plans. Initiatives in the Pharmaceuticals Division incurred costs of CHF 272 million, mainly employee-
related. Other major items were CHF 90 million for plans for outsourcing of IT and other functions to shared service centres and external
providers and CHF 72 million at Chugai.
In 2018 total global restructuring costs were CHF 0.9 billion. Further details are given in Note 7 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Pharmaceuticals Division. The Pharmaceuticals Division recorded impairment charges to intangible assets of CHF 633 million.
Impairment charges of CHF 381 million related to the full or partial impairments of five different compounds due to either clinical data
assessments or decisions to stop the development of the respective compounds. A charge of CHF 168 million related to the full
impairment of a compound purchased separately, driven by a change in the development plan. Impairment charges of CHF 78 million
related to the partial impairment of a compound developed together with an alliance partner, mainly driven by reduced revenue
forecasts.
Diagnostics Division. The Diagnostics Division recorded impairment charges of CHF 1,123 million. The major part of this was a charge
of CHF 779 million for the partial write-off of goodwill related to the Diabetes Care business. The impairment is a result of revised market
assumptions related to the blood glucose monitoring area and a slower than expected growth in other parts of this business. In the
Molecular Diagnostics business there was a charge for a full impairment of CHF 259 million for the product intangible assets acquired as
part of the GeneWeave acquisition. The main factors leading to this were updated assumptions on timelines, research and development
expenses and production costs. In addition, there was an impairment of CHF 85 million in the Sequencing business for the full write-off
of product intangible assets acquired as part of the Ariosa acquisition. This was mainly due to a change in timelines for the launch of
related sequencing products.
In 2018 there were impairment charges of CHF 2.4 billion in the Pharmaceuticals Division. The largest item was a charge of CHF 1.8 billion
relating to the goodwill and intangible assets from the InterMune acquisition in 2014. The Diagnostics Division recorded impairment
charges of CHF 1.0 billion. The major part of this was in the sequencing business.
Further details are given in Notes 9 and 10 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Legal and environmental cases
Based on the development of the various litigations, notably the Avastin/Lucentis investigations and the Meso case, there was a net
increase in provisions of CHF 369 million. This was a major element of the 2019 expenses for legal cases of CHF 422 million. The expected
costs of the environmental remediation at the Clarecastle site in Ireland were reassessed and resulted in an increase in the provisions.
There were no other significant developments affecting the 2019 financial results. Further details are given in Note 20 to the Annual
Financial Statements.
Net income and earnings per share
IFRS net income increased by 30% in CHF terms and by 32% at CER, while the diluted EPS increased by 28% in CHF terms and by 30%
at CER. Core net income increased by 14% and Core EPS increased by 13%, both at CER. The core basis excludes non-core items such
as global restructuring costs, amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and income and impacts from the accounting
for merger and acquisition transactions and alliance arrangements. The amount of net income attributable to non-controlling interests
increased by 64% due to the increased contribution of Chugai to the overall Group results.

In the Pharmaceuticals Division net working capital decreased by 36% at CER. This was mainly due to higher rebate and chargeback
accruals. Excluding this, net trade working capital in the Pharmaceuticals division was 1% lower, with a decrease in inventories due to
write-offs and lower inventories for mature products. Trade receivables increased due to the underlying sales growth. Long-term net
operating assets increased by 17% largely due to the Spark Therapeutics acquisition, where the initial purchase price allocation added
CHF 4.5 billion to goodwill. In the Diagnostics Division there were increases in net working capital of 5% and 4% in net trade working
capital. These were driven by an increase in trade receivables due to the growth in sales, and by an increase of inventories due to quality
issues and an increase in instruments pending placement. Long-term net operating assets decreased by 3% following impairment
charges to goodwill and intangible assets.
The decrease in net debt was due to the free cash flow of CHF 16.8 billion, partly offset by the dividend payments of CHF 7.7 billion and
net cash payments of CHF 4.6 billion for the Spark Therapeutics acquisition. This led to a reduction in gross debt to CHF 14.4 billion
from CHF 18.8 billion at the end of 2018. The net pension liability was 9% higher at CHF 6.5 billion following decreases in discount rates.
Net deferred tax assets increased mainly due to the Swiss tax reform, impairment of intangible assets and equity compensation plans.
The resolution of tax disputes reduced current tax liabilities. Lease liabilities of CHF 1.2 billion were a result of the accounting changes
in IFRS 16 that brought operating leases onto the balance sheet effective 1 January 2019.

The Group’s operating free cash flow was CHF 20.9 billion, an increase of 11% at CER. This was due to higher cash generation of the
pharmaceuticals business partly offset by higher investments in intangible assets. Net working capital was lower due to increases in
accruals for rebates and chargebacks and a reduction in net trade working capital in the Pharmaceuticals Division. The free cash
flow was CHF 16.8 billion, an increase of 12% at CER. This was due to the higher operating free cash flow, partly offset by higher tax
payments.

Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division were CHF 48.5 billion, an increase of 11% at CER. New product sales more than compensated
for the biosimilar competition to MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin. China reported continuously strong growth of 36% due to
broader market penetration.
The sales growth was driven by the continuing rollout of the new products Ocrevus, Hemlibra, Tecentriq and Perjeta, which together
contributed an additional CHF 4.4 billion (CER) of new sales, representing 93% of the division’s growth. Ocrevus in particular continued
its high growth development with total sales now reaching CHF 3.7 billion (2018: CHF 2.4 billion) due to continuing growth in the US
and continuing uptake in other markets, notably Germany and Italy. The launch and rollout of Hemlibra continued with sales reaching
CHF 1.4 billion, across all regions. Tecentriq sales grew in all regions, mostly due to higher demand in the US and launches in Japan, Italy,
Spain, Germany and France. Perjeta sales were up by 29% to CHF 3.5 billion with growth across all regions.
Biosimilar competition had a negative impact during the year, estimated at CHF 1.5 billion. Sales of MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin fell
by CHF 1.2 billion (CER) in Europe and Japan in 2019. In the US, the first biosimilar versions of Herceptin, Avastin and MabThera/Rituxan
came to market in the second half of 2019, and had an estimated impact of CHF 0.3 billion on 2019 sales. The first biosimilar versions of
Avastin were registered in Japan in late 2019, which had limited impact on sales so far. In total, Avastin, MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin
sales in 2019 were CHF 19.6 billion, a decrease of CHF 0.9 billion (CER) or 4%.
The oncology therapeutic area grew by 6%, led by the new products Tecentriq and Perjeta. Kadcyla sales increased by 45% with
growth across all regions, mainly in the US due to the launch of a new indication. Avastin sales grew by 4%, mainly in China due to broader
market penetration and across the US, despite the launch of a biosimilar in mid-2019. Herceptin sales fell by 12% affected by biosimilar
competition in Europe, Japan and the US. MabThera/Rituxan sales decreased by 4% due to biosimilar pressure in Europe and Japan.
The launches of the first biosimilar of MabThera/Rituxan in the US in late 2019 had limited impact on sales so far. Alecensa (+38%)
showed continuing post-launch growth across all regions.
Sales in immunology grew by 4%, with Actemra/RoActemra and Esbriet increasing by 8% and 9% respectively. MabThera/Rituxan sales
increased by 1% driven by the US. Lucentis sales grew 8% in the US in all approved indications. Infectious diseases sales were 2% higher
mainly due to higher Rocephin sales in China partly offset by lower sales of Valcyte/Cymevene in the US and Europe due to generic
competition. In other therapeutic areas, sales of Activase/TNKase grew 2% in the US.

therapeutic area, driven by the subcutaneous formulation, and also in immunology. The first biosimilar version of MabThera/Rituxan was
launched in the US in November 2019, which has had only a limited impact on sales so far. Sales in the International region were 1%
lower due to competitive pressures across various countries, partially offset by 16% growth in China due to broader market penetration.

Sales in the HER2 franchise grew by 4% to CHF 11.0 billion. Herceptin sales were 12% lower, mainly driven by Europe, partially offset
by the growth in China where sales increased by 59% due to broader market penetration. The 43% decline in Europe was mainly due to
biosimilar launches from mid-2018. In the US, Herceptin sales were 8% lower. In part this was due to patients switching to Kadcyla
(which showed 74% growth in the US) and in part due to the launch of the first US biosimilar in July 2019. Sales of Perjeta grew by 29%
with increased demand in all regions, notably in the early breast cancer adjuvant setting. Kadcyla sales increased by 45% globally
due to the launch of a new indication.

United States. Sales grew by 13% led by Ocrevus, Hemlibra and Tecentriq. Ocrevus sales increased by 44% and were driven by both
new and returning patient demand. Hemlibra sales showed strong uptake since the launch in November 2017. Tecentriq sales increased
by 148%, which was mainly driven by growth in new indications. The HER2 franchise grew by 4%, with the sales increase of Kadcyla
being due to the launch of a new indication and the increase in Perjeta being especially driven by the early breast cancer adjuvant setting.
Avastin sales increased by 2% due to continued growth in all indications, partly offset by the launch of the first biosimilars from July 2019.
The first biosimilars of Herceptin were also launched in mid-2019 and of MabThera/Rituxan in late 2019.
Europe. Sales grew by 1% for the full year (compared to a 4% decline in the first six months of 2019) with the launch and continuous
uptake of new products more than compensating for the impact of biosimilars by the full year. Herceptin and MabThera/Rituxan sales
decreased 43% and 33% respectively, due to the competition from biosimilars. There was strong growth of Ocrevus and Perjeta, notably
in Germany. Tecentriq sales continued to grow, following launches in Italy and Spain and continued uptake in Germany and France.
Alecensa sales increased, in particular in France, Italy and Germany. The growth of Hemlibra sales was driven by France, Germany, Italy
and the UK.
Japan. Sales increased by 9%, driven by the new products including Hemlibra, Tecentriq and Gazyva/Gazyvaro, which were all launched
in 2018. The HER2 franchise grew by 26%, with sales increase of Perjeta of 90% due to the launch of a new indication. This growth was
partially offset by lower sales of MabThera/Rituxan (–44%), Xeloda (–36%), Tarceva (–46%) and Herceptin (–5%) which were negatively
affected by competing products such as biosimilars and generics. The sales of Avastin remained stable. The launches of the biosimilar
versions of Avastin in Japan in late 2019 had limited impact on sales.
International. Sales increased by 15%, mainly due to the 36% growth in China, where there was broader market penetration for Herceptin,
Avastin and MabThera/Rituxan and new launches for Perjeta and Alecensa. Sales in China towards the end of 2019 were impacted by a
reduction in the level of channel inventory. The growth in Russia of 96% was driven by the inclusion of Perjeta and Kadcyla in the National
Oncology Program as well as the launch of Tecentriq. Excluding China and Russia, sales in the rest of the International region increased
by 5% with growth in new products (Perjeta, Ocrevus, Tecentriq and Kadcyla) more than offsetting a decline in Herceptin and MabThera/
Rituxan.

Competition from generic medicines and biosimilars
The Group’s pharmaceutical products are generally protected by patent rights, which are intended to provide the Group with exclusive
marketing rights in various countries. However, patent rights are of varying scope and duration, and the Group may be required to enter
into costly litigation to enforce its patent and other intellectual property rights. Loss of market exclusivity for one or more major products
– either due to patent expiration, challenges from generic medicines, biosimilars and non-comparable biologics or other reasons –
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations or financial condition. The introduction of a generic,
biosimilar or non-comparable biologic version of the same or a similar medicine typically results in a significant reduction in net sales
for the relevant product, as other manufacturers typically offer their versions at lower prices.
Patents and their expiry are, and always have been, an integral part of the Group’s business model and future growth will remain driven
by innovation. The latest information from clinical studies is included in the Annual Report on pages 42 to 57 and details of the Group’s
Product Development Portfolio are available for download at:

Tarceva 298 538 –44 Patent expiry in US in 2018
The intellectual property for biologics can involve multiple patents and patent timelines for each individual product and therefore it is more
difficult to give an exact date for patent expiry for biologic medicines. The basic, primary patents for the Group’s major biologic medicines
begin to expire as follows:
• MabThera/Rituxan: from 2018 in the US.
• Herceptin: from 2019 in the US.
• Avastin: from 2019 in the US and from 2020 in the EU.
• Subcutaneous formulations of MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin: beyond 2025 (secondary patent rights).
Biosimilar competition for these three products had an estimated negative impact of CHF 1.5 billion in 2019, with the main impact being
sales of MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin which fell by CHF 1.2 billion (CER) in Europe and Japan.
United States. The first biosimilar versions of Herceptin and Avastin were launched in the US from mid-2019 and the first biosimilar
versions of MabThera/Rituxan in late 2019. The estimated impact on 2019 sales was CHF 0.3 billion.
Europe. The first biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan were launched in Europe from mid-2017. They are now marketed in most
EU countries and were the major factor in the sales decline of this product in Europe in 2019. The first biosimilar versions of Herceptin
were launched in major EU markets from mid-2018. Based on publicly available information from competitor companies, the Group
currently anticipates that the first biosimilar versions of Avastin could come to market in Europe in the first half of 2020.
Japan. In Japan, the first biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin were launched in 2018. Sales were impacted by
this and by government price cuts. The first biosimilar version of Avastin was launched in late 2019 in the colorectal cancer setting.

Royalties and other operating income decreased by 15% at CER. Royalty income was 39% lower mainly due to the expiry of the Cabilly
patent at the end of 2018. The income related to this patent decreased by CHF 705 million to CHF 224 million. Out-licensing income was
lower due to the base effect of the higher milestone income in 2018. Income from product disposals and other increased to CHF 961 million
driven by income of CHF 446 million from sale of rights for Lexotan, Bactrim and Dormicum and higher profit-share income of CHF 457 million
from increased Venclexta and Xolair sales.

Core costs increased by 7% at CER. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased by 0.7 percentage points to 20.9%. Manufacturing
cost of sales grew by 3%, below the sales growth. The volume-driven manufacturing cost increase was partially offset by a favourable
product mix and lower inventory write-offs in 2019. Royalty expenses were 33% higher due to increased sales of certain products,
notably Ocrevus. In 2019 an impairment of property, plant and equipment for idle plant was recognised. Non-core costs include the
amortisation of intangible assets, mainly related to the Esbriet product intangible assets acquired in the InterMune acquisition of 2014.
The amortisation charges in 2019 were higher for the Esbriet product intangible assets since the previous impairments were partially
reversed at the end of 2018.

and distribution activities included supporting the launches and rollouts of Tecentriq, Ocrevus and Xofluza and supporting pre-launch
activities. The cost increase was also associated with ramp-up of marketing activities in the Personalised Health Care, Foundation Medicine
and Flatiron Health strategic businesses. Restructuring costs were related to the resourcing flexibility initiatives in sales affiliates.

remained the largest area of research and development with the cancer immunotherapy portfolio being a key driver. Neuroscience
and immunology also represent significant areas of spending. In addition, the Pharmaceuticals Division in-licensed pipeline compounds
and technologies, which were capitalised as intangible assets. These had a total cost of CHF 1.4 billion (2018: CHF 0.8 billion), of which
USD 500 million were initial upfront payments to Adaptive Biotechnologies and Dicerna Pharmaceuticals. Impairment charges of
CHF 632 million were incurred for the impairment of different compounds due to either clinical data assessments or decisions to stop
the development of the respective compounds.

to increases at Foundation Medicine and the base effect from Flatiron Health, which was acquired in April 2018. Legal and environmental
charges were higher due to an increase in provisions related to the Avastin/Lucentis investigations and an increase in a provision for
environmental remediation at the Clarecastle site. Impairment charges in 2018 related to the full write-off of goodwill from the InterMune
and Trophos acquisitions.

Pharmaceuticals Division total core operating profit and operating profit both include the elimination of CHF minus 258 million of unrealised intercompany gains between
Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai (2018: CHF minus 50 million).
The increase in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen had a positive impact of approximately 5% on the Chugai results when expressed
in Swiss francs for the Group’s consolidated results. At CER (as reported in Japanese yen), sales by Chugai to external customers
increased by 9% while sales within the division increased by 22%. Chugai core operating profit increased by 68% due to higher royalty
income from Roche Pharmaceuticals as well as higher gross profit from sales to external customers and sales within the division. This was
partially offset by lower income from the divestment of established products and higher research and development costs. Operating free
cash flow at Chugai increased as a result of the strong operating performance and lower capital expenditures, due to the base effect of
the land purchase in Yokohama, Japan, in 2018.

The absolute amount of the movement between the 2019 and 2018 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2019 transactions (translated at average
rates for 2018) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2019 transactions include non-cash movements and therefore the movements in this
table are not the same as the amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only includes the cash movements). A full consolidated balance sheet is given on page 45 of the
Annual Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given above is on pages 167–168.
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc appreciated against
the US dollar, resulting in a negative translation impact on net operating assets. The exchange rates used are given on page 30.
Net working capital. Net working capital decreased by 36%, due to a higher net liability for other receivables/payables, while net trade
working capital was 1% lower. Trade receivables were higher following the underlying sales growth in the business. Inventories decreased
primarily due to write-offs and lower inventory levels for certain mature products. The increase in trade payables was mainly due to the
outstanding USD 200 million upfront payment due to Dicerna Pharmaceuticals. The net liability position for other receivables/payables
increased mainly due to higher accruals for rebates and chargebacks.
Long-term net operating assets. Overall long-term net operating assets increased by 17% largely due to the Spark Therapeutics
acquisition, where the initial purchase price allocation added CHF 4.5 billion to goodwill. There was an increase of CHF 0.8 billion from
right-of-use assets because of the implementation of IFRS 16 at the beginning of the year. The increase in provisions is mainly attributable
to ongoing litigations and restructuring activities. Capital expenditure includes investments at the Basel and Kaiseraugst site in Switzerland
and at the South San Francisco campus in the US, manufacturing investments in Switzerland, the US, Japan and Germany as well as
expenditure for the new research facilities in Yokohama, Japan.

cash adjustments increased by 12%, in line with the core operating profit growth of 12%. Net working capital was lower due to reductions
in net trade working capital, for the reasons described above in the ‘Financial position’ section, and an increase in accruals for rebates
and chargebacks. Capital expenditure was lower due to the base effect in 2018 of the Yokohama land purchase and the final payment of
the Genentech property lease option exercise. Investments in intangible assets were higher than in 2018 and include USD 300 million
for an initial upfront payment to Adaptive Biotechnologies.

Core costs increased by 6% at CER, above the sales growth of 3%. This was due to higher costs from external suppliers and increased
costs for technical and engineering services. Royalty expenses were significantly lower as a result of the renegotiation of a licensing
agreement. The core cost of sales ratio increased by 1.5 percentage points to 47.8%. Global restructuring costs increased due to strategy
plans. Amortisation of intangible assets is lower following the impairments of intangible assets recognised in the second half of 2018.

Core costs were stable at CER, due to higher marketing expenses for the digital solutions business that were offset by lower bad debt
expenses. Regionally, higher spending in Asia-Pacific was offset by lower expenses in Europe and North America. On a core basis,
marketing and distribution costs as a percentage of sales decreased to 22.5% compared to 23.0% in 2018. The increase in global
restructuring plan cost relates to transformation projects affecting the sales force.

Core costs increased by 1% at CER, due to spending in new projects in cardiac disease within the Centralised and Point of Care Solutions
portfolio, as well as increased spending for laboratory automation. This was partly offset by lower spending in development projects,
notably in Molecular Diagnostics and Diabetes Care. As a percentage of sales, research and development core costs were stable at 11.3%.

Core costs decreased by 2% at CER due to a gain on property disposal. Administration costs were stable due to cost containment
initiatives, while business taxes were higher due to the base effect of the settlement agreement for the Medical Device Excise Tax in
the US in 2018. As a percentage of sales, core costs decreased to 3.9% from 4.1% in 2018. The impairment charges of CHF 779 million
are the partial write-off of the goodwill related to the Diabetes Care business. Mergers and acquisitions and alliance transactions
include income from the reversal of contingent consideration provisions. Legal and environmental costs in 2019 included litigation costs
for the Meso case.

The absolute amount of the movement between the 2019 and 2018 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2019 transactions (translated at average
rates for 2018) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2019 transactions include non-cash movements and therefore the movements in this
table are not the same as the amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only includes the cash movements). A full consolidated balance sheet is given on page 45 of the
Annual Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given above is on pages 167–168.
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc appreciated against the
euro and the US dollar, resulting in a negative translation impact on net operating assets. The exchange rates used are given on page 30.
Net working capital. Net working capital increased by 5%, while net trade working capital increased by 4%. These increases were
mainly attributable to trade receivables and inventories, which increased by 3% and 4% respectively. Trade receivables increased due
to the growth in sales and a change in distributor channels in Middle East. The increase in inventories was due to quality issues and
an increase in instruments pending placement.
Long-term net operating assets. Overall long-term net operating assets decreased by 3% at CER, which was mainly a result of
the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. The right-of-use assets recorded in 2019 were a result of the implementation of IFRS 16.
Provisions increased due to higher litigation and restructuring provisions, partially offset by the reversal of the contingent consideration
provisions. Capital expenditure relates to instrument placements, manufacturing expansion projects in Germany and a site consolidation
project in the US.

The operating free cash flow of the Diagnostics Division was a net cash inflow of CHF 963 million, a decrease of 28% at CER compared
to 2018. The cash generation of the business, measured by the operating profit, net of operating cash adjustments, was stable compared
to the 1% increase in core operating profit. This difference was due to higher cash spending on restructuring and litigation cases. Net
working capital movement absorbed CHF 276 million of cash in 2019, which was due to increases in inventories and trade receivables,
as mentioned above in the ‘Financial position’ comments. Capital expenditure of CHF 1.6 billion was due to the items mentioned above
in the ‘Financial position’ section, with the increased spending relative to 2018 being driven by a site consolidation project in the US of
CHF 122 million. Investments in intangible assets were mainly related to an in-licensing deal of CHF 215 million.

General and administration costs increased by 7% at CER on a core basis, driven by higher project-related administration costs in most
corporate functions. The lower restructuring costs came from a reduction in restructuring activities in IT and Procurement. Net working
capital was lower due to higher payables. The change in long-term net operating assets was largely attributable to right-of-use assets
recorded following the implementation of IFRS 16. Corporate operating free cash flow showed a higher outflow due to settlement of
payables.

The results expressed in Swiss francs were negatively impacted by the stronger Swiss franc on average against the euro and Latin
American currencies, partly offset by the appreciation of the US dollar against the Swiss franc. There was a 1 percentage point net impact
on sales and core operating profit expressed in Swiss francs compared to constant exchange rates and a 2 percentage point net impact
on Core EPS. The sensitivity of Group sales and core operating profit to a 1% change in average foreign currency exchange rates against
the Swiss franc during 2019 is shown in the table below.

The Group’s revenues are primarily generated from sales of products to customers. Such revenues are mainly received in the local
currency of the customer’s home market, although in certain emerging markets invoicing is made in major international currencies such
as the US dollar and euro. Cost of sales, marketing and some administration costs follow the same currency pattern as sales. The
majority of research and development activities are incurred at the Group’s global research facilities, and therefore the costs are mainly
concentrated in US dollars, Swiss francs and euros. General and administration costs tend to be incurred mainly at central locations
in the US, Switzerland and Germany. Chugai’s revenues and costs are denominated in Japanese yen.

Financing costs
Core financing costs were CHF 962 million, an increase of 28% at CER compared to 2018 due to losses on early debt redemption
of CHF 202 million in 2019 (none in 2018). Interest expenses, including amortisation of debt discount and issue costs, remained stable
at CHF 602 million. The net interest cost of defined benefit pension plans was CHF 140 million. A full analysis of financing costs is given
in Note 4 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 31Roche Group | Financial Review
Other financial income (expense)
Core other financial income (expense) was a net income of CHF 59 million compared to a net income of CHF 149 million in 2018. Net
income from equity securities was a gain of CHF 185 million, driven by unrealised gains in a Roche Venture Fund investment in Allakos.
This compares to a net gain of CHF 311 million in 2018, when the Group realised a gain on sale of Avexis shares of CHF 100 million as well
as unrealised gains on Allakos. The net foreign exchange results, which reflect hedging costs and losses on unhedged positions, were
losses of CHF 205 million compared to net losses of CHF 160 million in 2018. A full analysis of other financial income (expense) is given in
Note 4 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Income taxes
The Group’s effective core tax rate decreased by 3.4 percentage points to 16.3% in 2019. This was mainly due to the impacts from
the resolution of several tax disputes. Some tax disputes were resolved in the first half of 2019 and additional, unrelated tax disputes were
resolved in the second half of 2019. This resulted in a positive income statement impact of CHF 454 million, equivalent to 2.1 percentage
points on the effective core tax rate for the full year 2019.
The IFRS results saw the effective tax rate decrease by 8.1 percentage points. In addition to the core impacts mentioned above, the lower
goodwill impairments, the non-core impacts from the Swiss tax reform, as described below, and the deferred tax impact from equity
compensation plans further decreased the IFRS tax rate. The IFRS results also include the releases of contingent consideration provisions
that are not taxable, hence the net effect in the ‘Mergers and acquisitions and alliance transactions’ line in the table below.
In Switzerland changes to the Swiss federal and canton Basel-Stadt tax laws were enacted during the first half of 2019. The relevant changes
for the Roche Group include a decrease in the Basel-Stadt tax rate, effective from 1 January 2019, and new limitations. These changes do not
reduce the Group’s effective tax rate in Basel-Stadt. Changes in the tax laws in other Swiss cantons where the Group operates were enacted
during the second half of 2019. The Group has carried out a remeasurement of its deferred tax positions, which resulted in a transitional
deferred tax income of CHF 236 million in 2019. This has been reported as a non-core item and has no impact on tax payments.
Further details of the Group’s income tax expenses and related balance sheet positions are given in Note 5 to the Annual Financial
Statements.

Financial position
The decrease in net debt was mainly due to the free cash flow of CHF 16.8 billion, partly offset by the dividend payments of CHF 7.7 billion
and net cash payments of CHF 4.6 billion for the Spark Therapeutics acquisition. The net pension liability increased due to lower discount
rates. Net deferred tax assets increased mainly due to the Swiss tax reform, impairment of intangible assets and equity compensation plans.
The resolution of tax disputes reduced current tax liabilities. At 31 December 2019 the Group held equity investments with a market value
of CHF 0.7 billion, which consist mostly of holdings in biotechnology and other pharmaceuticals companies which were acquired as part
of licensing transactions, scientific collaborations or other investments of the Roche Venture Fund.
32 | Roche Finance Report 2019Financial Review | Roche Group
Free cash flow
The net cash outflow from treasury activities decreased to CHF 0.6 billion. Total taxes paid in 2019 were up by 7% to CHF 3.5 billion
due to higher payments in the US partly offset by refunds received for the resolution of several tax disputes.

Operating free cash flow increased by 11% at CER to CHF 20.9 billion. This was due to the higher growth in the underlying cash generated
from operations, as cash revenues grew more than cash expenses. It was partly offset by higher investments in intangible assets.
The free cash flow of CHF 16.8 billion was 12% higher than in 2018, as a result of higher operating free cash flow, partly offset by
the higher tax payments.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 33Roche Group | Financial Review
Effective 1 January 2019 the Group has implemented IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ and the comparative 2018 results have not been restated. The main
impact of the new standard is to bring operating leases onto the balance sheet. The application of the new standard does not materially
impact operating free cash flow, as repayment of the principal portion of the lease liabilities paid in the 2019 presentation almost entirely
matches the operating lease expenses that were included in operating profit in the 2018 presentation. Net debt is unaffected, as the
Group’s definition of net debt does not include lease liabilities.

The net debt position of the Group at 31 December 2019 was CHF 2.5 billion, a reduction of CHF 3.1 billion from 31 December 2018.
The reduction in gross debt was CHF 4.4 billion to a total of CHF 14.4 billion at the end of 2019. This was driven by the free cash flow of
CHF 16.8 billion, partly offset by the annual dividend payments of CHF 7.7 billion and net cash payments of CHF 4.6 billion for the
Spark Therapeutics acquisition.

Debt. This consists mainly of bonds and notes and includes the principal and interest on the Group’s debt instruments. Other debt is
mainly commercial paper. The carrying values are discounted based on the interest rates inherent in the instruments.
Contingent consideration. These are potential payments arising from mergers and acquisitions. The carrying values are risk-adjusted
and discounted.
Lease liabilities. These are the future obligations under non-cancellable lease contracts. The Group has implemented IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
effective 1 January 2019 and since that point these obligations have been reported on the balance sheet.
Unfunded defined benefit plans. These are mainly the pension plans in the Group’s German affiliates, where the fully reserved pension
obligations are used for self-financing of the local affiliates’ operations. The carrying values are discounted. Future company contributions
to the Group’s funded plans are not shown in the above table.
Capital commitments for property, plant and equipment. These are non-cancellable commitments for the purchase and construction
mainly at the Roche sites in Basel, Switzerland, South San Francisco, US, and Mannheim, Germany, and also at the Chugai site in
Yokohama.
Leasing commitments. These are the major non-cancellable commitments for signed lease agreements where the lease term has not yet
started. These mainly relate to Foundation Medicine’s site in Boston, US.
Contract manufacturing commitments. These are the future minimum take-or-pay commitments to purchase inventories arising from
the Group’s major long-term agreements with external Contract Manufacturing Organisations (‘CMOs’).
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 35Roche Group | Financial Review
Alliance collaboration commitments. These are potential upfront and milestone payments that may become due from the Group’s
in-licensing arrangements. Potential payments to alliance partners and for asset deals within the next three years are included assuming
all projects currently in development are successful. Potential payments beyond three years are only included for asset deals.
Provisions for legal and environmental matters. These are not included in the above table as the timing and amount of any cash
outflow is uncertain and contingent on the development of the matters in question.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate
fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. In 2019
expenses for the Group’s defined contribution plans were CHF 410 million (2018: CHF 419 million). All other plans are classified as ‘defined
benefit plans’, even if the Group’s potential obligation is minor or has a relatively remote possibility of arising. Plans are usually established
as trusts which are independent of the Group and are funded by payments from the Group and by employees, but in some cases the plan
is unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources. In 2019 expenses for the Group’s
defined benefit plans were CHF 738 million (2018: CHF 657 million).

Overall the funding status on an IFRS basis of the Group’s funded defined benefit plans decreased to 92% compared to 93% at the start
of the year. This came mainly from a decrease in the discount rates globally since the end of 2018, largely offset by an increase in
the fair value of the plan assets in Switzerland and the US. The funded status of the pension funds is monitored by the local pension fund
governance bodies as well as being closely reviewed at a Group level. The total cash outflow from the Group’s defined benefit plans
in 2019 was CHF 0.7 billion compared to CHF 0.8 billion in 2018. There were higher additional contributions paid into the Group’s pension
plans in Japan in 2019 and in the US in 2018.
The unfunded plans are mainly those in the Group’s German affiliates, where the fully reserved pension obligations are used for
self-financing of the local affiliates’ operations. The unfunded liabilities for these plans increased during 2019 due to a decrease in
the eurozone discount rate.
Full details of the Group’s pensions and other post-employment benefits are given in Note 26 to the Annual Financial Statements.

Proposed dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing an increase of 3% in the dividend for 2019 to CHF 9.00 per share and non-voting equity security
(2018: CHF 8.70) for approval at the Annual General Meeting. This would be the 33rd consecutive increase in the dividend. If the dividend
proposal is approved by shareholders, dividend payments on the total shares and non-voting equity securities will amount to CHF 7.8 billion
(2018: CHF 7.5 billion), resulting in a pay-out ratio (based on core net income) of 44.6% (2018: 48.0%). Based on the prices at year-end 2019,
the dividend yield on the Roche share was 2.9% (2018: 3.6%) and the yield on the non-voting equity security was also 2.9% (2018: 3.6%).
Further information on the Roche securities is given on pages 169 to 170.

• On the due date of 30 September 2019 of USD 2.0 billion of bonds.
• On 13 December 2019 of USD 0.6 billion of bonds repaid at the option of the issuer at par 3 months before the scheduled due date
of 13 March 2020.
Debt redemptions. On 5 December 2019 the Group completed a tender offer to redeem the following instruments:
• USD 656 million 2.875% fixed rate notes due 29 September 2021
• USD 360 million 3.25% fixed rate notes due 17 September 2023
• USD 1,061 million 3.35% fixed rate notes due 30 September 2024

• USD 37 million 5.25% fixed rate notes due 15 July 2035
• USD 73 million 7.0% fixed rate notes due 1 March 2039
This early debt redemption resulted in a total payment of USD 2,874 million and a reported loss on redemption of CHF 202 million.
Debt issuances. During 2019 there were no debt issuances.
All the above transactions are further described in Note 21 to the Annual Financial Statements.

The Group plans to meet its debt obligations using existing liquid funds as well as cash generated from business operations. In 2019
the free cash flow was CHF 16.8 billion, which included the cash generated from operations, as well as payment of interest and tax.
For short-term financing requirements, the Group has a commercial paper program in the US under which it can issue up to USD 7.5 billion
of unsecured commercial paper notes and has committed credit lines of USD 7.5 billion available as back-stop lines. Commercial
paper notes totalling USD 1.4 billion were outstanding as of 31 December 2019 (2018: USD 0.6 billion). For longer-term financing the
Group maintains strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA by Standard & Poor’s and Aa3 by Moody’s, which should
facilitate efficient access to international capital markets.
Further information on the Group’s debt is given in Note 21 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 39Roche Group | Financial Review
Financial risks
At 31 December 2019 the Group had a net debt position of CHF 2.5 billion (2018: CHF 5.7 billion). The financial assets of the Group are
managed in a conservative way with the objective to meet the Group’s financial obligations at all times.
Asset allocation. A considerable portion of the cash and marketable securities the Group currently holds is being used for debt
repayment. Liquid funds are either held as cash or are invested in high-quality, investment-grade fixed income securities with an
investment horizon to meet those liquidity requirements.
Cash and marketable securities
2019 2018
(CHF m) (% of total) (CHF m) (% of total)
Cash and cash equivalents 6,075 51 6,681 51
Money market instruments 4,963 42 5,381 41
Debt securities 807 7 1,047 8
Equity securities 13 0 9 0
Total cash and marketable securities 11,858 100 13,118 100
Credit risk. Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations causing financial
losses for the Group. The rating profile of the Group’s CHF 11.9 billion of cash and fixed income marketable securities remained strong
with 93% being invested in the A–AAA range. The Group has signed netting and collateral agreements with the counterparties in order
to mitigate counterparty risk on derivative positions.
The Group has trade receivables of CHF 11.3 billion. Since the beginning of 2010 there have been financial difficulties in Southern
European countries, notably Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. The Group is a leading supplier to the healthcare sectors in these
countries and at 31 December 2019 has trade receivables of EUR 0.5 billion (CHF 0.6 billion) with public customers in these countries.
This is an increase of 8% compared to 31 December 2018 in euro terms. The Group uses different measures to improve collections in
these countries, including intense communication with customers, factoring, negotiations of payment plans, charging of interest for late
payments, and legal actions. Since 2011 the Group’s trade receivables balance in Southern Europe has decreased by 64% in euro terms.
Liquidity risk. Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time.
The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements at any
point in time. In addition to the current liquidity position, the Group has strong cash generation ability. Those future cash flows will be
used to repay debt instruments in the coming years.
Roche enjoys strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA by Standard & Poor’s and Aa3 by Moody’s. At the same time Roche
is rated at the highest available short-term ratings by those agencies. In the event of financing requirements, the ratings and the strong
credit of Roche should permit efficient access to international capital markets, including the commercial paper market. The Group
has committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling USD 7.5 billion available as back-stop lines for the commercial paper
program. As at 31 December 2019 no debt has been drawn under these credit lines.
Market risk. Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities. The exposures are
predominantly related to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to
assess the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. VaR data indicates the value range within which a given financial instrument
will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices. The Group’s VaR decreased since December 2018
mainly due to the repayment and early redemption of long-term debt in the second half of 2019 as well as due to the reduction in the
underlying interest rates across major Group currencies.
Interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could affect the Group’s financial result or the value
of the Group equity. The Group may use interest rate derivatives to manage its interest rate-related exposure and financial result.
Further information on financial risk management and financial risks and the VaR methodology is included in Note 31 to the Annual
Financial Statements.

International Financial Reporting Standards
The Roche Group has been using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to report its consolidated results since 1990. In 2019
the Group implemented IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, including any consequential amendments to other standards. The Group has also implemented
various minor amendments to existing standards and interpretations, including IFRIC 23 ‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’, which
have no material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position.
New and revised standards applied in 2019
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. The Group has implemented the new standard effective 1 January 2019 and has applied the cumulative catch-up
method option for the transition, meaning that the comparative 2018 results have not been restated. The main impact of the new standard
is to bring operating leases onto the balance sheet. The new standard results in the carrying value of leased assets (‘right-of-use assets’)
increasing by CHF 1.2 billion as of 1 January 2019, with lease liabilities increasing by a similar amount. The application of the new standard
resulted in part of what has been previously reported as operating lease costs being recorded as interest expenses. Given the leases
involved and the prevailing low interest rate environment, the Group does not currently expect this effect to be material, with the amount
in 2019 being CHF 18 million.
See Note 28 to the Annual Financial Statements for further details.

Consolidated Financial Statements
1. General accounting principles
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements (hereafter ‘the Annual Financial Statements’) of the Roche Group have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. They have been prepared using the historical cost
convention except for items that are required to be accounted for at fair value. They were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on
27 January 2020 and are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on 17 March 2020.
These financial statements are the Annual Financial Statements of Roche Holding Ltd, a company registered in Switzerland, and its
subsidiaries (‘the Group’).
The Group’s significant accounting policies and changes in accounting policies are disclosed in Note 34.
Key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Annual Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingent amounts. Actual outcomes could differ from those
management estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical
experience and various other factors. Revisions to estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. The following
are considered to be the key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions made and are believed to be appropriate based upon
currently available information.
Revenue. The nature of the Group’s business is such that many sales transactions do not have a simple structure and may consist of
various performance obligations that are satisfied at different times. Contracts entered into in the Diagnostics Division typically include
performance obligations for instruments (including those provided under leasing arrangements), reagents and other consumables,
and services. Instruments may be sold in cash sales transactions at discounted prices. Where instruments are provided under operating
lease arrangements, some or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent reagents sales. Sales, net of discounts,
are based on estimates regarding the related obligations, including their stand-alone selling prices or fair values. It requires judgement
to determine when different obligations are satisfied, including whether enforceable purchase commitments for further obligations exist
and when they arise. Out-licensing agreements may be entered into with no further obligation or may include commitments to conduct
research, late-stage development, regulatory approval, co-marketing or manufacturing. These may be settled by a combination of upfront
payments, milestone payments, other licensing fees, and reimbursements for services provided. Whether to consider these commitments
as a single performance obligation or separate ones, or even being in scope of IFRS 15 ‘Revenues from Contracts with Customers’, is not
straightforward and requires some judgement. Depending on the conclusion, this may result in all revenue being calculated at inception
and either being recognised at once or spread over the term of a longer performance obligation.
Sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts and estimates of product returns, all of
which are established at the time of sale. All product sales allowances are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed
on the related sales. At 31 December 2019 the Group had CHF 4,157 million in provisions and accruals for expected sales returns,
chargebacks and other rebates, including Medicaid in the US and similar rebates in other countries. The provisions and accruals relating
to the US Pharmaceuticals business amounted to CHF 2,021 million, of which CHF 562 million were associated with expected sales
returns. These estimates take into consideration historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known
market events and trends such as competitive pricing and new product introductions, estimated inventory levels, and the shelf life of
products. If actual future results vary, these estimates need to be adjusted, with an effect on sales and earnings in the period of the
adjustment.
48 | Roche Finance Report 2019Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Business combinations. The Group initially recognises the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non-
controlling interest and the consideration transferred in a business combination. Management judgement is particularly involved in
the assessment of whether or not the net assets acquired constitute a business and in the recognition and fair value measurement of
intellectual property, inventories, contingent liabilities and contingent consideration. In making this assessment, management considers
the underlying economic substance of the items concerned in addition to the contractual terms. Management also applies as it considers
appropriate the optional ‘concentration test’ as set out in the amendments to IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ published in October 2018
to aid the assessment of whether a transaction represents a business combination or is simply in substance the purchase of a single asset
or group of similar assets.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, goodwill and intangible assets. At 31 December 2019 the
Group had CHF 22,173 million in property, plant and equipment (see Note 8), CHF 1,145 million in right-of-use assets (see Note 28),
CHF 12,456 million in goodwill (see Note 9) and CHF 8,358 million in intangible assets (see Note 10). Goodwill and intangible assets not
yet available for use are reviewed annually for impairment. Property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets in use
are assessed for impairment when there is a triggering event that provides evidence that an asset may be impaired. To assess whether
any impairment exists, estimates of expected future cash flows are used. Actual outcomes could vary significantly from such estimates.
Factors such as changes in discount rates, the planned use of buildings, machinery or equipment or closure of facilities, the presence of
competition, technical obsolescence and lower-than-anticipated product sales could lead to shorter useful lives or impairment.
Impairment of financial assets. At 31 December 2019 the Group had CHF 532 million in allowance for doubtful accounts for trade and
lease receivables (see Note 12). The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss
rates. The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the calculation of the allowance for doubtful
accounts, based on the company’s past experience, existing market conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the end of each
reporting period.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits. The Group operates a number of defined benefit plans and the fair values of the
recognised plan assets and liabilities are based upon statistical and actuarial calculations. The measurement of the net defined benefit
obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate, inflation rate, expected mortality and medical cost trend rate assumptions.
At 31 December 2019 the present value of the Group’s defined benefit obligation is CHF 23,855 million (see Note 26). The actuarial
assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changes in market and economic conditions, longer or shorter lifespans
of participants, and other changes in the factors being assessed. These differences could impact the defined benefit plan assets and
liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Legal provisions. The Group provides for anticipated legal settlement costs when there is a probable outflow of resources that can
be reliably estimated. Where no reliable estimate can be made, no provision is recorded and contingent liabilities are disclosed where
material. At 31 December 2019 the Group had CHF 882 million in legal provisions. The status of significant legal cases is disclosed in
Note 20. These estimates consider the specific circumstances of each legal case, relevant legal advice and are inherently judgemental
due to the highly complex nature of legal cases. The estimates could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each
legal case progresses.
Environmental provisions. The Group provides for anticipated environmental remediation costs when there is a probable outflow
of resources that can be reasonably estimated. At 31 December 2019 the Group had CHF 503 million in environmental provisions
(see Note 20). Environmental provisions consist primarily of costs to fully clean and refurbish contaminated sites, including landfills,
and to treat and contain contamination at certain other sites. These estimates are inherently judgemental due to uncertainties related
to the detection of previously unknown contamination, the method and extent of remediation, the percentage of the problematic
materials attributable to the Group at the remediation sites, and the financial capabilities of other potentially responsible parties.
The estimates could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each environmental remediation progresses.
Contingent consideration provisions. The Group makes provision for the estimated fair value of contingent consideration arrangements
arising from business combinations. At 31 December 2019 the Group had CHF 205 million in contingent consideration provisions
(see Note 20) and the total potential payments under contingent consideration arrangements from business combinations could be up
to CHF 532 million (see Note 31). The estimated amounts provided are the expected payments, determined by considering the possible
scenarios of forecast sales and other performance criteria, the amount to be paid under each scenario, and the probability of each scenario,
which is then discounted to a net present value. The estimates could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each
scenario develops.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 49Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Income taxes. At 31 December 2019 the Group had a current income tax net liability of CHF 3,601 million and a deferred tax net asset
of CHF 4,913 million (see Note 5). Significant estimates are required to determine the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Where tax positions are uncertain, accruals
are recorded within income tax liabilities for management’s best estimate of the ultimate liability that is expected to arise based on
the specific circumstances and the Group’s historical experience. Factors that may have an impact on current and deferred taxes include
changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, future levels of research and
development spending and changes in pre-tax earnings.
Leases. Where the Group is the lessee, key judgements include assessing whether arrangements contain a lease and determining the
lease term. To assess whether a contract contains a lease requires judgement about whether it depends on a specified asset, whether
the Group obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset, and whether the Group has a right to direct the use
of the asset. In order to determine the lease term judgement is required as extension and termination options have to be assessed along
with all facts and circumstances that may create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination
option. Estimates include calculating the discount rate which is based on the incremental borrowing rate. At 31 December 2019 the Group
has CHF 1,145 million in right-of-use assets and CHF 1,219 million in lease liabilities (see Note 28).
Where the Group is the lessor, the treatment of leasing transactions is mainly determined by whether the lease is considered to be
an operating or finance lease. In making this assessment, management looks at the substance of the lease, as well as the legal form,
and makes a judgement about whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Arrangements which
do not take the legal form of a lease but that nevertheless convey the right to use an asset are also covered by such assessments.
Consolidation. The Group periodically undertakes transactions that may involve obtaining control or significant influence over other
companies. These transactions include equity acquisitions, asset purchases and alliance agreements. In all such cases management
makes an assessment as to whether the Group has control or significant influence over the other company, and whether it should
be consolidated as a subsidiary or accounted for as an associated company. In making this assessment, management considers the
underlying economic substance of the transaction in addition to the contractual terms.

Sales are allocated to geographical areas by destination according to the location of the customer. Royalties and other operating income
are allocated according to the location of the Group company that receives the revenue.
Following the implementation of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (see Note 28), the Group has changed its accounting policies with respect to leases.
The Group has applied the cumulative catch-up method for the transition, meaning that the comparative 2018 results have not been
restated.
54 | Roche Finance Report 2019Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
For the operating segment disclosures the main impact of the new standard is to include right-of-use assets for leases where the
Group is the lessee and which were previously reported as operating leases, as part of segment operating assets, effective 1 January 2019.
Details of the additional segment net operating assets reported, which total to CHF 1,186 million, are given below.

Total operating 1,135 51 1,186
Lease liabilities – (1,190) (1,190)

A consequence of the application of the new standard is that the interest element of leases previously reported as operating lease
(and reported as part of operating lease costs within the segment results) is recorded as interest expenses, effective 1 January 2019.
Given the leases involved and the prevailing low interest rate environment the Group does not currently expect this effect to be material,
with the amount in 2019 being CHF 18 million.
Major customers
In total three US national wholesale distributors represent approximately a third of the Group’s revenues in 2019. The three US national
wholesale distributors are McKesson Corp. with CHF 10 billion (2018: CHF 9 billion), AmerisourceBergen Corp. with CHF 8 billion
(2018: CHF 7 billion) and Cardinal Health, Inc. with CHF 6 billion (2018: CHF 5 billion). Approximately 96% of these revenues were in
the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment, with the residual in the Diagnostics operating segment.

Gross-to-net sales reconciliation for the Pharmaceuticals Division
The gross-to-net sales reconciliation for the Pharmaceuticals Division is shown in the table below. The companies in the Diagnostics
Division have similar reconciling items, but at much lower amounts.

Government and regulatory mandatory price reductions. These consist of mandatory price reductions. The major elements
are 340B Drug Discount Program, Medicaid, and other plans in the US, which totalled USD 5.7 billion, equivalent to CHF 5.7 billion
(2018: USD 5.5 billion, equivalent to CHF 5.4 billion).
Contractual price reductions. These include rebates and chargebacks that are the result of contractual agreements that are primarily
volume based and performance based.
Cash discounts. These include credits offered to wholesalers for remitting payment on their purchases within contractually defined
incentive periods.
Customer returns reserves. These are allowances established for expected product returns.
Sales reductions that are expected to be withheld by the customer upon settlement, such as contractual price reductions and cash discounts,
are recorded in the balance sheet as a deduction from trade receivables (see Note 12). Sales reductions that are separately payable to
customers, governmental health authorities or healthcare regulatory authorities are recorded in the balance sheet as accrued liabilities
(see Note 19). Provisions for sales returns are recorded in the balance sheet as other provisions (see Note 20).

Revenue recognised in relation to performance obligations satisfied in previous years
In 2019 there was an increase in revenue recognised of CHF 199 million (2018: increase of CHF 30 million) relating to performance
obligations that were satisfied in previous periods, mainly due to adjustments of sales deduction provisions and accruals for expected
sales returns, chargebacks and other allowances in respect of previous years.
Remaining performance obligations in (partially) unsatisfied long-term contracts
Remaining performance obligations in (partially) unsatisfied long-term contracts are either included in deferred income or are related
to amounts the Group expects to receive for goods and services that have not yet been transferred to customers under existing,
non-cancellable or otherwise enforceable contracts. These are mainly associated with contracts in the Diagnostics Division that have
minimum purchase commitments related to reagents and consumables for previously sold instruments as well as monitoring and
maintenance services. For contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, the Group has elected the practical expedient
to not disclose the transaction price for remaining performance obligations at the end of each reporting period and at which point
in time the Group expects to recognise these sales.

As disclosed in Note 28 and in Note 34, following the implementation of IFRS 16, the Group has changed its accounting policies with
respect to leases. The Group has applied the cumulative catch-up method for the transition, meaning that the comparative 2018 results
have not been restated. The application of the new standard resulted in part of what has been previously reported as operating lease
costs being recorded as interest expenses. Given the leases involved and the prevailing low interest rate environment, the Group does
not expect this effect to be material, with the amount in 2019 being CHF 18 million.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 59Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Hyperinflationary economies
Since 1 July 2018 the Group has considered Argentina to be a hyperinflationary economy, in the context of IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting
in Hyperinflationary Economies’. The cumulative inflation index over the last three years exceeds 100%, as measured by the National
Wholesaler Price Index (Sistema de Índices de Precios Mayoristas).
Accordingly the Group has reviewed the reporting from its affiliates in Argentina, and where necessary restated them in line with IAS 29.
The potential adjustments resulting from the application of IAS 29 do not have a significant impact on the Group’s operating results and
balance sheet. An adjustment is recorded for the gains (losses) on the net monetary position, which is a loss of CHF 17 million resulting
from the loss in purchasing power of the positive net monetary position during 2019 of the Group’s Argentinian affiliates (2018: loss of
CHF 18 million).
5. Income taxes

Deferred taxes 1,179 598
Total income tax (expense) (2,506) (3,283)
Since the Group operates internationally, it is subject to income taxes in many different tax jurisdictions. The Group calculates its average
expected tax rate as a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates. This rate changes from year
to year due to changes in the mix of the Group’s taxable income and changes in local tax rates.
The Group’s average expected tax rate increased to 18.9% in 2019 (2018: 17.8%). This was largely due to the higher proportion of
the Group’s profits coming from tax jurisdictions with higher local tax rates than the average Group tax rate.
The Group’s effective tax rate decreased to 15.1% in 2019 (2018: 23.2%). The main drivers for the decrease were the resolution of several
tax disputes, which resulted in a positive income statement impact of CHF 454 million, the lower goodwill impairments, the impacts from
the Swiss tax reform and the deferred tax impact from equity compensation plans, which varies according to the price of the underlying
equities.
In Switzerland changes to the Swiss federal and canton Basel-Stadt tax laws were enacted during the first half of 2019. The relevant
changes for the Group include a decrease in the Basel-Stadt tax rate, effective from 1 January 2019, and new limitations. These changes
do not reduce the Group’s average expected tax rate in Basel-Stadt. Changes in the tax laws in other Swiss cantons where the Group
operates were enacted during the second half of 2019. The Group has carried out a remeasurement of its deferred tax positions and the
impacted net deferred tax liability positions on the balance sheet were reduced by CHF 208 million. The deferred tax remeasurement, which
does not have an impact on tax payments, resulted in a transitional deferred tax income of CHF 236 million during 2019. The remaining
adjustments of CHF 28 million were recorded to other comprehensive income, in so far as they relate to temporary differences arising on
items that were themselves recorded to other comprehensive income, such as actuarial gains/losses on Swiss pension plans.

The Group’s effective tax rate can be reconciled to the Group’s average expected tax rate as follows:
Reconciliation of the Group’s effective tax rate
2019 2018
Average expected tax rate 18.9% 17.8%
Tax effect of
– Non-taxable income/non-deductible expenses +0.5% +4.5%
– Equity compensation plans –0.6% +0.1%
– Research and development tax credits and other deductions –2.4% –2.0%
– US state tax impacts +0.4% +0.4%
– Tax on unremitted earnings +1.9% +1.2%
– Transitional effect of changes in US tax rates – –0.2%

– Resolution of several tax disputes –2.7% –
– Prior year and other differences +0.5% +1.4%
Group’s effective tax rate 15.1% 23.2%
The income tax benefit recorded in respect of equity compensation plans, which varies according to the price of the underlying equity,
was CHF 193 million (2018: CHF 59 million). Had the income tax benefits been recorded solely on the basis of the IFRS 2 expense
multiplied by the applicable tax rate, then a benefit of approximately CHF 99 million (2018: CHF 78 million) would have been recorded.

As disclosed in Note 28 and in Note 34, the Group has changed its accounting policies for leases following the implementation of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, effective 1 January 2019.
The Group has applied the cumulative catch-up method for the transition, meaning that the comparative balance sheets as at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 have not
been restated. Deferred tax assets as at 1 January 2018 were revised following the implementation of IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’.
The deferred tax net assets for other temporary differences mainly relate to accrued and other liabilities, including lease liabilities,
provisions and unrealised profit in inventory.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward only to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit is probable.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses, including valuation allowances, as follows:
Unrecognised tax losses: expiry
2019 2018
Amount Applicable Amount Applicable
(CHF m) tax rate (CHF m) tax rate
Within one year 1,654 12% 183 12%
Between one and five years 1,227 12% 2,150 12%
More than five years 14,781 7% 10,893 5%
Total unrecognised tax losses 17,662 8% 13,226 6%
62 | Roche Finance Report 2019Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
The ‘More than five years’ category includes losses that cannot be used for US state income tax purposes in those states which only
permit tax reporting on a separate entity basis.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been established for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the remittance
of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, where such amounts are currently regarded as permanently reinvested for the purpose of these
financial statements. The total unremitted earnings of the Group, regarded as permanently reinvested for the purpose of these financial
statements, were CHF 38.1 billion at 31 December 2019 (2018: CHF 33.9 billion).
6. Mergers and acquisitions
In 2018 the Group implemented the amendments to IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ issued in October 2018. The amendments further
clarify the definition of a business. The effect of the amendments is particularly applicable for many of the acquisitions carried out by
the Group, since the value in the acquired companies often largely consists of the rights to a single product or technology. From 2018
such transactions are accounted for as asset acquisitions rather than business combinations.
This note includes both transactions accounted for as business combinations and asset acquisitions. Asset acquisitions are acquisitions
of legal entities that do not qualify as business combinations under IFRS 3. Cash consideration paid for asset acquisitions at the
transaction date and subsequent additional contingent payments made upon the achievement of performance-related development
milestones are now presented in the line ‘Asset acquisitions’ as disclosed separately below. Subsequent consideration for performance-
related development milestones for transactions treated as asset acquisitions is recognised as intangible assets when the specific
milestones have been achieved.
Business combinations – 2019
Spark Therapeutics, Inc. On 17 December 2019 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Spark Therapeutics, Inc. (‘Spark
Therapeutics’), a publicly owned US company based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that had been listed on Nasdaq. Spark Therapeutics
is a fully integrated commercial company committed to discovering, developing and delivering gene therapies. Spark Therapeutics is
reported in the Pharmaceuticals Division. The total consideration was USD 4,772 million, which was paid in cash.
The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table below. The amounts are provisional based on preliminary
information because the transaction closed shortly before the end of the reporting period. Identification and valuation of intangible
assets, other assets and liabilities will be adjusted during 2020.

Due to the provisional accounting, apart from goodwill, no intangible assets have yet been recognised. The provisional goodwill computed
in the table above also represents rights to Spark Therapeutics’ clinical and pre-clinical assets. This includes Spark Therapeutics’ lead
clinical asset SPK-8011, a novel gene therapy for the treatment of haemophilia A, and Luxturna, Spark Therapeutics’ marketed gene therapy
for the treatment of patients with confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy (an inherited retinal disease). Luxturna
was the first gene therapy to receive an FDA approval in 2017. The European Commission granted marketing authorisation for Luxturna in
2018. In addition, goodwill represents Spark Therapeutics’ technological capabilities in gene therapy. Any remaining goodwill will include
a control premium, the acquired work force and the expected synergies. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax
purposes.
The Spark Therapeutics accounts receivable is comprised of gross contractual amounts due of CHF 12 million which were all expected
to be collectable at the date of the acquisition.
Directly attributable transaction costs of CHF 25 million were reported in the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment within general
and administration expenses.
The impact of the acquisition on the 2019 results for the Pharmaceuticals Division and the Group were not material. If the acquisition
had occurred on 1 January 2019 management estimates that Spark Therapeutics would have contributed revenue of approximately
CHF 80 million and a net loss (after tax) of approximately CHF 450 million in 2019. This information is provided for illustrative purposes
only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have occurred had Spark Therapeutics actually
been acquired at the beginning of the year, or indicative of the future results of the combined Group.
Business combinations – 2018
Flatiron Health, Inc. On 5 April 2018 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Flatiron Health, Inc. (‘Flatiron Health’), a privately
owned US company based in New York City. Flatiron Health is reported in the Pharmaceuticals Division. The total consideration was
USD 1,616 million, which was paid in cash.
The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table below.

The fair value of Flatiron Health’s technology platform was determined using an excess earning method that is based on management
forecasts and observable market data for discount rates, tax rates and foreign exchange rates. The present value was calculated using
a risk-adjusted discount rate of 10.4% for Flatiron Health. The valuation was performed by an independent valuer.
Goodwill represents the value of accelerating progress towards data-driven personalised healthcare in cancer and to advance the
use of real-world evidence to set new industry standards for oncology research and development. It also represents a control premium,
the acquired work force and expected synergies. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The Group recognised a financial gain of CHF 78 million for fair valuing the 12% interest in Flatiron Health held by the Group prior to
the transaction. This gain is included in the statement of changes in equity within the line item ‘Net change in fair value – financial assets
at fair value through OCI’ in 2018 and has been transferred to ‘Retained earnings’ upon obtaining control.

Directly attributable transaction costs of CHF 3 million were reported in the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment within general
and administration expenses.
In the nine months to 31 December 2018 Flatiron Health contributed revenue of CHF 56 million and a net loss (after tax) of CHF 175 million
to the results reported for the Pharmaceuticals Division and the Group. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2018 management
estimates that Flatiron Health would have contributed revenue of CHF 78 million and a net loss (after tax) of CHF 187 million in 2018.

Cash-generating units used for allocating goodwill
Pharmaceuticals Division. During 2018 the Group made a comprehensive reassessment of the cash-generating units used for allocating
goodwill in the Pharmaceuticals Division. The conclusions of this reassessment were as follows:
• Within the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment, goodwill arises from three broad types of transactions:
• – Strategic transactions that have a transformative effect across the whole division.
• – Technology transactions, where the acquired technologies can have a range of areas of applications.
• – Product transactions, where the acquired products typically have more limited synergistic benefits outside of the immediate product
therapeutic area.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from strategic transactions is the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from technology transactions is also the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment.
However, if the acquired technologies permanently cease to operate then this will be treated as a disposal of the business; in such
cases the goodwill will be deemed to have been disposed of and will be fully impaired.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from product transactions is the smallest identifiable group of assets related to the
revenues and related costs that arise from the development and commercialisation of the product(s) in question. Where there are
synergistic benefits to other products in the same therapeutic area, then the revenues, costs and corresponding assets of these other
products are also taken into account. If the acquired products permanently cease to generate economic benefits then this will be
treated as a disposal of the business; in such cases the goodwill will be deemed to have been disposed of and will be fully impaired.
• Chugai is a separate operating segment in the Group’s financial reporting and a separate cash-generating unit to which goodwill
is allocated.
The Group allocated the goodwill in the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment as listed below. The basis for the allocation were
the historical amounts of goodwill that arose from the individual transactions.
• Strategic transactions consist of Genentech (1990/1999), Foundation Medicine (2015), Flatiron Health (2018) and Spark Therapeutics
(2019).
• Technology transactions consist of Therapeutic Human Polyclonals (2007), Dutalys (2014) and Santaris (2014).
• Product transactions consist of GlycArt (2005), Tanox (2007) and InterMune (2014).
Diagnostics Division. The division’s business areas and the sequencing business are the cash-generating units used for the testing of
goodwill. The goodwill arising from the Corange/Boehringer Mannheim acquisition and part of the goodwill from the Ventana acquisition
is recorded and monitored at a divisional level as it relates to the strategic development of the whole division and cannot be meaningfully
allocated to the division’s business areas. Therefore the cash-generating unit for this goodwill is the entire division. The goodwill arising
from the Viewics acquisition is monitored at the divisional level. The recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is based on value
in use.
Impairment charge – 2019
A charge of CHF 779 million was recorded in the Diagnostics Division for the partial write-off of goodwill related to the Diabetes Care
business. The impairment is a result of revised market assumptions related to the blood glucose monitoring area and a slower than expected
growth in other parts of this business.
72 | Roche Finance Report 2019Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Impairment charge – 2018
Pharmaceuticals Division. The assessment for the potential impairment of goodwill in the Pharmaceuticals Division was carried out
using the cash-generating units as set out above. During 2018 impairment charges totalling CHF 2,147 million were recorded in the
Pharmaceuticals Division.
InterMune acquisition. A charge of CHF 2,040 million was recorded for the full write-off of goodwill from the InterMune acquisition
made in 2014. The main product acquired in the original transaction was InterMune’s medicine for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Esbriet.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive disease, which causes scarring of the lungs and has a survival rate of two to three years
from diagnosis.
During 2017 the Group recorded an impairment charge of CHF 1,664 million for the partial impairment of the Esbriet product intangible
in use. The main factor leading to this was a decrease in forecasted cash flows relative to the previous year’s long-term forecast due to
a reduction in sales expectations. During 2018 the Group reviewed the assets and liabilities that were acquired in 2014 from the
InterMune transaction in detail including the initial valuations, the reports made for the purposes of the acquisition accounting and
subsequent integration process. The conclusion of this review was that, apart from the intangible asset representing the acquired
rights to Esbriet and the related deferred taxation liabilities, there were no other assets or liabilities recorded on the Group’s balance
sheet, no other revenue streams and no other parts of the acquired company that had any synergistic benefits for the continued
operations of the Roche Group.
During 2018 the Group made the required assessment for the potential impairment of goodwill that arose from the InterMune
acquisition using as the cash-generating unit the identifiable group of assets related to the revenues and related costs that arose
from the development and commercialisation of Esbriet. As part of the Group’s regular process the value in use of the intangible
asset representing the acquired rights to Esbriet was first tested for impairment (see Note 10). As a second step the goodwill from
the InterMune acquisition was then tested for impairment. The conclusion of these impairment tests were:
• In substance the remaining value to the Group from the InterMune acquisition is estimated at CHF 2,413 million. This solely relates to
the acquired rights to Esbriet and should be reported in the Group’s balance sheet as a product intangible asset in use.
• The previously recorded impairment on the Esbriet product intangible asset in use was therefore partially reversed and an income of
CHF 274 million was recorded for this. The asset concerned was written up to its estimated recoverable value of CHF 2,413 million.
The main factor leading to this was an increase in forecasted cash flows relative to the previous year’s long-term forecast due to an
improvement in sales expectations. The intangible asset continues to be amortised over its remaining estimated useful life of three years
(see also Note 10).
• A full impairment of CHF 2,040 million was recorded for the goodwill from the InterMune acquisition. The revenues and related costs
arising from the development and commercialisation of Esbriet are fully utilised in the impairment testing process to support the
value in use of the Esbriet product intangible asset in use. There is no surplus from Esbriet revenues to support the carrying value
of the goodwill, neither are there any synergistic benefits to other products in the same therapeutic area. Accordingly the separable
recoverable value of this goodwill is estimated to be zero and it has been fully impaired.
Trophos acquisition. A charge of CHF 107 million was recorded for the full write-off of goodwill from the Trophos acquisition made
in 2015. The main product acquired in the original transaction was Trophos’ proprietary screening platform-generated olesoxime
(TRO19622), which was being developed for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare and debilitating genetic neuromuscular disease that
is most commonly diagnosed in children. During 2018 the Group decided to stop development of this compound. Therefore there are
no potential future revenues to support the carrying value of the goodwill, neither are there any synergistic benefits to other products
in the same franchise. Accordingly the intangible assets relating to this product were fully impaired (see Note 10) and the goodwill is
deemed to have been disposed of and has also been fully impaired.
Diagnostics Division. A charge of CHF 107 million was recorded in the Centralised and Point of Care Solutions business area for the full
write-off of goodwill from the CMI acquisition made in 2013. During 2018 the Group decided to change the commercialisation strategy
for diagnostic instruments used in haematology testing. This led to a full impairment of the product intangibles in use acquired as part of
the CMI acquisition (see Note 10). Therefore the goodwill is deemed to have been disposed of and has also been fully impaired.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 73Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Value in use
Value in use is calculated using a discounted expected cash flow approach, with a post-tax discount rate applied to the projected risk-
adjusted post-tax cash flows and terminal value. The discount rate is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital as the cash-generating
units have integrated operations across large parts of the Group. It is derived from a capital asset pricing model using data from capital
markets, including government twenty-year bonds. For assessing value in use, the cash flow projections are based on the most recent
long-term forecasts approved by management. The long-term forecasts include management’s latest estimates on sales volume and
pricing, as well as production and other operating costs and assume no significant changes in the organisation. Other key assumptions
used in the calculations are the period of cash flow projections included in the long-term forecasts, the terminal value growth rate and
the discount rate.
Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations
2019 2018
Period of Terminal Period of Terminal
cash flow value Discount rate cash flow value Discount rate

Pharmaceuticals Division 5 years n/a 7.4% 5 years n/a 7.5%
Diagnostics Division 5 years 1.5% 7.4% 5 years 1.5% 7.5%
For cash-generating units with a terminal value growth, the respective rate does not exceed the long-term projected growth rate for
the relevant market.
Fair value less costs of disposal
For goodwill arising from the Chugai acquisition, the fair value less costs of disposal is determined with reference to the publicly quoted
price of Chugai shares.
Sensitivity analysis
Management has performed sensitivity analyses for Roche Pharmaceuticals and the Diagnostics Division, which increased the discount
rate by 1% combined with decreasing the forecast cash flows by 5%, and for Chugai, which decreased the publicly quoted share prices
by 5%. Except for Diabetes Care, the results of the sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the above changes in the key assumptions
would not cause the carrying values of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amounts at 31 December 2019. The above key assumptions
changes would result in a goodwill impairment of CHF 865 million for Diabetes Care at 31 December 2019.

Internally generated intangible assets
The Group currently has no internally generated intangible assets from development as the criteria for the recognition as an asset are
not met.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
The Group currently has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Intangible assets not available for use
These mostly represent in-process research and development assets acquired either through in-licensing arrangements, business
combinations, asset acquisitions or separate purchases. At 31 December 2019 approximately 70% (2018: 71%) of the projects in the
Pharmaceuticals Division have known decision points within the next twelve months which in certain circumstances could lead to
impairment. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the research and development processes, intangible assets not available for use are
particularly at risk of impairment if the project is not expected to result in a commercialised product.
76 | Roche Finance Report 2019Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Intangible asset impairment
Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
eventual disposal. Factors such as the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence or lower-than-anticipated sales for
products with capitalised rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
Impairment charges – 2019
Pharmaceuticals Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 633 million were recorded. The major items related to:
• A charge of CHF 168 million for the full impairment of a compound purchased separately, driven by a change in the development plan.
The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 137 million following clinical data assessment of two compounds. The assets concerned, which were not yet being
amortised, were fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 125 million due to the decision to stop the development of a compound with an alliance partner. The asset concerned,
which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 78 million for the partial impairment of a compound developed together with an alliance partner, mainly driven by
reduced revenue forecasts. The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was partially written down.
• A charge of CHF 60 million due to the decision to stop the development of a compound and the related collaboration activities with an
alliance partner. The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 59 million due to the decision to stop the development of a compound purchased separately. The asset concerned,
which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
Diagnostics Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 344 million were recorded which related to:
• A charge of CHF 259 million for the impairment of Molecular Diagnostics product intangibles in use acquired as part of the GeneWeave
acquisition. The main factors leading to this were updated assumptions on timelines, research and development expenses and
production costs. The asset concerned, which was being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 85 million for the impairment of sequencing business product intangibles in use acquired as part of the Ariosa
acquisition mainly due to a change in timelines for the launch of related sequencing products. The asset concerned, which was being
amortised, was fully written down.
Impairment charges – 2018
Pharmaceuticals Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 233 million, net of impairment reversals, were recorded which related to:
• A charge of CHF 197 million due to the decision to stop the development of five different compounds with five different alliance
partners. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 122 million due to the decision to stop the development of a compound purchased separately. The asset concerned,
which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 100 million due to the decision to stop the development of the compound acquired as part of the Trophos acquisition.
The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 66 million for the partial impairment of a compound purchased separately due to a delayed timeline. The asset
concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was partially written down.
• A charge of CHF 13 million following a clinical data assessment. The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully
written down.
• A charge of CHF 9 million for other impairments. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully written down.
• The previously recorded impairment on the Esbriet product intangible asset in use was partially reversed and an income of
CHF 274 million was recorded for this. The asset concerned was written up to its estimated recoverable value of CHF 2,413 million.
The main factor leading to this was an increase in forecasted cash flows relative to the previous year’s long-term forecast due to an
improvement in sales expectations. The intangible asset continues to be amortised over its remaining estimated useful life of three
years. Goodwill impairment charges related to the InterMune acquisition are discussed in Note 9.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 77Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Diagnostics Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 849 million were recorded which related to:
• A charge of CHF 400 million for the full impairment of intangibles both in use and not available for use related to the sequencing
business mainly acquired as part of the Genia, CAPP and Signature acquisitions. The factors leading to this impairment were a change
in the commercialisation strategy for related products and a change in timelines for future product development. The assets concerned,
which were partly being amortised and partly not yet being amortised, were fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 206 million for the partial impairment of sequencing business product intangibles in use acquired as part of the
Ariosa acquisition. The factor leading to this impairment was a decrease in forecasted cash flows following revised sales assumptions.
The asset concerned, which was being amortised, was written down to its estimated recoverable value of CHF 89 million.
• A charge of CHF 243 million for the full impairment of Centralised and Point of Care Solutions’ product intangibles in use acquired
as part of the CMI acquisition as a result of a decision to change the commercialisation strategy for diagnostic instruments used in
haematology testing. The asset concerned, which was being amortised, was fully written down.
Potential commitments from alliance collaborations and purchase agreements within the next three years
The Group is party to in-licensing and similar arrangements with its alliance partners and intangible asset purchase agreements with third
parties, including asset acquisitions. These arrangements and purchase agreements may require the Group to make certain milestone or
other similar payments dependent upon the achievement of agreed objectives or performance targets as defined in the collaboration and
purchase agreements.
The Group’s current estimate of future third-party commitments for such payments within the next three years is set out in the table below.
These figures are undiscounted and are not risk-adjusted, meaning that they include all such potential payments that can arise assuming
all projects currently in development are successful. The timing is based on the Group’s current best estimate. These figures do not include
any potential commitments within the Group, such as may arise between the Roche and Chugai businesses.

Roche Finance Report 2019 | 83Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
In 2019 CHF 1,003 million of provisions were utilised (2018: CHF 901 million), of which CHF 828 million (2018: CHF 883 million) are
included in the cash flows from operating activities and CHF 175 million (2018: CHF 18 million) are included in the cash flows from
business combinations for payments made from deferred and contingent consideration arrangements (see Note 6).
Legal provisions
Legal provisions consist of a number of separate legal matters, including claims arising from trade, in various Group companies.
By their nature the amounts and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict.
As part of the regular review of litigation matters, management has reassessed the provisions recorded for certain litigation matters.
Based on the development of the various litigations, notably the Avastin/Lucentis investigations and the Meso case, there was
a net increase in provisions of CHF 369 million. This was a major element of the 2019 expenses for legal cases of CHF 422 million
(2018: net expense of CHF 128 million). Details of the major legal cases outstanding are disclosed below.
Environmental provisions
Provisions for environmental matters include various separate environmental issues in a number of countries. By their nature the amounts
and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict. Significant provisions are discounted by between 1% and 3% where the time value
of money is material. The significant provisions relate to the US site in Nutley, New Jersey, which was divested in September 2016, the
estimated remediation costs for a landfill site near Grenzach, Germany, that was used by manufacturing operations that were closed
some years ago and the estimated remediation costs for the manufacturing site at Clarecastle, Ireland. In 2019 the expected costs of
environmental remediation at the Clarecastle site and other matters were reassessed. Accordingly, in 2019 environmental provisions
increased by CHF 60 million, net. The net environmental expenses were CHF 59 million (2018: net expense of CHF 31 million).
The Group’s procedures on environmental protection are included in the Annual Report on pages 76 to 85. These include the actions
taken by the Group with regard to climate change, notably the Group’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Restructuring provisions
These arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of business undertaken by the Group or the manner in which
business is conducted. Such provisions include only the costs necessarily entailed by the restructuring which are not associated with
the recurring activities of the Group. The timings of these cash outflows are reasonably certain. These provisions are not discounted as
the time value of money is not material in these matters.
In the Pharmaceuticals Division the significant provisions relate to the strategic realignment of its manufacturing network and the resourcing
flexibility plans. In the Diagnostics Division the significant provisions are associated with programmes to address long-term strategy, while
in Corporate they relate to plans for outsourcing of IT and other functions to shared service centres and external providers. Further details
are given in Note 7.
Contingent consideration provisions
The Group is party to certain contingent consideration arrangements arising from business combinations. Significant provisions are
discounted using an average discount rate of 3.0% (2018: 3.6%) where the time value of money is material. Additional details on
measurement, on main movements of the provisions and on the total potential payments under these arrangements are provided in Note 31.
84 | Roche Finance Report 2019Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Other provisions
Other provisions relate to the items shown in the table below. With the exception of employee provisions, the timing of cash outflows is by
its nature uncertain.

Employee provisions 389 398 362
Other items 611 438 441
Total other provisions 1,616 1,333 1,169
Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees, to be affected by political, legislative, fiscal
and regulatory developments, including those relating to environmental protection, in the countries in which it operates. The industries
in which the Group operates are also subject to other risks of various kinds. The nature and frequency of these developments and events,
not all of which are covered by insurance, as well as their effect on future operations and earnings, are not predictable.
The Group has entered into strategic alliances with various companies in order to gain access to potential new products or to utilise other
companies to help develop the Group’s own potential new products. Potential future payments may become due to certain collaboration
partners achieving certain milestones as defined in the collaboration agreements. The Group’s best estimates of future commitments for

At 31 December 2019 provisions for legal cases were CHF 803 million (2018: CHF 483 million), mainly related to legal cases
in the Pharmaceuticals Division of CHF 483 million (2018: CHF 371 million) and in the Diagnostics Division of CHF 314 million
(2018: CHF 107 million). Provisions have been recorded, and in some cases settled, mainly relating to the Pharmaceuticals legal
matters and to Meso, a Diagnostics legal case, listed below.
Accutane. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (‘HLR’) and various other Roche affiliates have been named as defendants in numerous legal
actions in the US and elsewhere relating to the acne medication Accutane. The litigation alleges that Accutane caused certain serious
conditions, including, but not limited to, inflammatory bowel disease (‘IBD’), birth defects and psychiatric disorders. In 2009 HLR
announced that, following a re-evaluation of the portfolio of medicines that are now available from generic manufacturers, rapidly
declining brand sales in the US and high costs from personal-injury lawsuits that it continues to defend vigorously, it had decided
to immediately discontinue the manufacture and distribution of the product in the US.
All of the actions pending in federal court alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation (‘MDL’)
in the US District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division. In August 2015 the MDL was closed. During the pendency of
the MDL the District Court granted summary judgment in favour of HLR for all of the federal IBD cases that had proceeded and all were
affirmed by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. All of the actions pending in state court in New Jersey alleging IBD were
consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County.
In February 2015 the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County, held an eight-day evidentiary hearing on whether
plaintiffs’ experts can testify that Accutane causes Crohn’s disease. On 20 February 2015 the Superior Court barred plaintiffs’ experts
because their methods did not meet the requirements for scientific reliability. On 8 May 2015 the Superior Court entered an order
dismissing with prejudice an agreed-upon list of 2,076 Crohn’s disease cases that were subject to the Superior Court’s February 2015 order.
On 28 July 2017 the New Jersey Appellate Division reversed the order excluding plaintiffs’ experts from testifying that Accutane causes
Crohn’s disease and reinstated the dismissed cases finding that the trial court wrongfully barred plaintiffs’ expert witnesses. HLR filed a
petition for review to the New Jersey Supreme Court, which was granted on 8 December 2017. On 1 August 2018 the Supreme Court issued
its decision on whether plaintiffs’ experts can testify that Accutane causes Crohn’s disease. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment
of the New Jersey Appellate Division and concluded that the trial court properly had excluded the experts thereby dismissing 2,174 cases
alleging that Accutane caused plaintiffs’ Crohn’s disease. Plaintiffs cannot further appeal. All 2,174 Crohn’s disease cases were
permanently dismissed.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 85Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
On 12 May 2015 the Superior Court entered an order granting summary judgment and dismissing 18 cases filed by New Jersey residents
on the basis that the drug label was adequate as a matter of law since 2002. In July 2015 the Superior Court granted HLR’s motion for
summary judgment as to the adequacy of the label for post-2002 ingestion cases in 44 other jurisdictions. The Superior Court applied
New Jersey law to all of the jurisdictions and granted HLR’s motion dismissing approximately 511 cases. In the alternative, the Superior
Court applied the home state law and granted summary judgment in 24 jurisdictions and denied it in 20 jurisdictions; this would have
resulted in 389 cases being dismissed. On 25 July 2017 the New Jersey Appellate Division affirmed the dismissal of 197 cases and
reinstated judgments in 335 cases based on the strength of HLR’s warnings after 2002. HLR and the dismissed plaintiffs filed petitions
for review to the New Jersey Supreme Court, which was granted on 8 December 2017. On 3 October 2018 the Supreme Court issued its
decision on those cases and reversed the judgment of the New Jersey Appellate Division that had reinstated 335 cases on the basis
that the drug label was adequate as a matter of law since 2002. Plaintiffs cannot further appeal. 532 cases were permanently dismissed.
In January and October 2016 the Superior Court entered orders granting summary judgment and dismissing 191 cases for failure to prove
Accutane proximately caused their ulcerative colitis. The plaintiffs appealed all of these decisions. During February and March 2017 the
Superior Court held an evidentiary hearing on whether plaintiffs’ experts can testify that Accutane causes ulcerative colitis. In April 2017
the Superior Court barred plaintiffs’ experts because their methods did not meet the requirements for scientific reliability. In May 2017
the Superior Court entered an order dismissing 3,231 ulcerative colitis cases that were subject to the Superior Court’s April 2017 order.
The plaintiffs appealed these decisions.
At 31 December 2019 HLR was defending no pending actions and there were approximately 3,422 cases on appeal. After a hearing on
7 January 2020, on 17 January 2020 the New Jersey Appellate Division issued its decision on whether plaintiffs’ experts can testify that
Accutane causes ulcerative colitis. The Court affirmed the trial court’s ruling and concluded that the trial court properly had excluded the
experts thereby dismissing cases alleging that Accutane caused plaintiffs’ ulcerative colitis. Plaintiffs have until 6 February 2020 to seek
review by the New Jersey Supreme Court.
If any cases survive the appeals, additional trials may be scheduled. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including
many that are unique to the particular case and therefore the trial results to date may not be predictive of future trial results. The Group
continues to defend vigorously the remaining personal injury cases and claims.
Avastin/Lucentis investigations. On 14 February 2013 the Italian Antitrust Authority (‘AGCM’) announced an investigation to determine
whether Roche, Genentech and Novartis had entered into an agreement to restrict competition in the Italian market for drugs, with
reference in particular to Avastin (marketed by Roche) and Lucentis (marketed by Novartis). Avastin and Lucentis are two different
drugs that were developed and approved for different therapeutic purposes and contain different active pharmaceutical ingredients.
On 5 March 2014 the AGCM issued a verdict that alleges that Roche and Novartis colluded to artificially differentiate Avastin and
Lucentis in order to foster the sales of Lucentis in Italy. The AGCM fined Roche EUR 90.5 million and Novartis EUR 92 million. Roche
appealed the AGCM verdict to the Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale del Lazio (‘TAR’). On 2 December 2014 the TAR upheld the
decision by the AGCM. Roche appealed the verdict of the TAR to the Consiglio di Stato. In July 2014 Roche paid the EUR 90.5 million
fine under protest to avoid additional penalty fees and recorded an expense within general and administration. On 23 January 2018
the European Court of Justice rendered its decision on five questions which were referred to the European Court of Justice by the
Consiglio di Stato. On 15 July 2019 the Consiglio di Stato issued the final verdict on the case and upheld the verdicts of both the AGCM
and the TAR. With respect to the fine of the AGCM, this matter is now concluded. The Italian Ministry of Health and some Italian regions
notified the Group of their intention to seek damages related to this matter. On 24 January 2019 the French Competition Authority
(‘FCA’) issued a Statement of Objections against Roche, Genentech and Novartis regarding anticompetitive practices concerning the
commercialisation of Avastin and Lucentis in France. The FCA alleges that Roche, Genentech and Novartis abused their collective
dominant position on the French market for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration between 2008 and 2013. The Group
is vigorously defending itself in these matters. In addition the Group is challenging policies and regulations allowing off-label/unlicensed
use and reimbursement for economic reasons in various countries. The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
PDL-1 inhibitor litigation. On 26 July 2017 Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (‘BMS’) filed a lawsuit against Genentech, Inc. (‘Genentech’) in
Delaware. BMS alleges that Genentech’s sale of Tecentriq infringes their US Patent No. 9,402,899. BMS is seeking judgment in its favour,
a finding of wilfulness and monetary damages. On 4 October 2017 Genentech filed its answer and counterclaims, seeking a declaratory
judgment of invalidity of the 9,402,899 patent. In May 2019 BMS and Genentech agreed to drop the lawsuit without prejudice to the case
being refiled at a later date. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Average Wholesale Prices litigation. HLR and Roche Laboratories Inc. (‘RLI’), along with approximately 50 other brand and generic
pharmaceutical companies, have been named as defendants in several legal actions in the US relating to the pricing of pharmaceutical
drugs and State Medicaid reimbursement. The primary allegation in these litigations is that the pharmaceutical companies misrepresented
or otherwise reported inaccurate Average Wholesale Prices (‘AWP’) and/or Wholesale Acquisition Costs (‘WAC’) for their drugs, which
prices were allegedly relied upon by the states in calculating Medicaid reimbursements to entities such as retail pharmacies. The states,
through their respective Attorney General, are seeking repayment of the amounts they claim were over-reimbursed. The time period
associated with these cases is 1991 through 2005. At 31 December 2019 HLR and RLI are defending one AWP action filed in the state
of New Jersey. HLR and RLI are vigorously defending themselves and no trial date has been set. The outcome of this matter cannot be
determined at this time.
Boniva litigation. HLR, Genentech and various other Roche affiliates (collectively ‘Roche’) have been named as defendants in numerous
legal actions in the US and one now dismissed case in Canada relating to the post-menopausal osteoporosis medication Boniva. In these
litigations, the plaintiffs allege that Boniva caused either osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypical femoral fractures. At 31 December 2019
Roche is defending approximately 252 actions involving approximately 293 plaintiffs brought in federal and state courts throughout the
US for personal injuries allegedly resulting from the use of Boniva. All of these cases are in the early discovery stages of litigation. Individual
trial results depend on a variety of factors, including many that are unique to the particular case. Roche is vigorously defending itself in
these matters. The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Meso litigation. In February 2017 Roche Diagnostics Corporation (‘Roche’) filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of
Delaware against Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC (‘Meso’). This is a patent infringement case involving certain US patents owned by
BioVeris Corporation (‘BioVeris’), a company acquired by the Group in 2007. Meso holds a limited exclusive licence to use certain aspects
of the electrochemiluminescence (‘ECL’) detection technology. Roche and Meso disagree on the scope of the licence. The lawsuit is
seeking a declaratory judgment to get judicial clarification that Roche is not infringing Meso’s licence. On 25 November 2019 the jury
found that Roche’s use of the patents infringed the scope of Meso’s licence. There was no injunction granted and the jury awarded Meso
USD 137 million in damages. Meso is expected to claim additional pre-judgment interest, reimbursement of attorney’s fees and future
royalties. The Group is currently evaluating this decision and its legal options.
In addition, the Pharmaceuticals legal cases listed below do not currently have provisions recorded, but there are potential future
obligations which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events or where the obligation cannot
be measured with sufficient reliability.
Hemlibra litigation. On 4 May 2017 Baxalta Inc. and Baxalta GmbH (both together ‘Baxalta’), subsidiaries of Takeda Pharmaceutical
Company Limited, filed a patent infringement and declaratory judgment of patent infringement suit in the US District Court for the District
of Delaware, alleging that Genentech and Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (‘Chugai’) currently or imminently would manufacture, use,
sell, offer for sale, or import into the US Hemlibra, which would infringe Baxalta’s US Patent No. 7,033,590. Baxalta is seeking a judgment
of infringement, injunctive and monetary relief, attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses. On 11 May 2017 Genentech was served with the
complaint. Genentech’s response and counterclaims to the complaint were filed on 30 June 2017. On 19 June 2017 Chugai waived
service. On 13 September 2017 Chugai filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. On 14 December 2017
Baxalta filed a request for a preliminary injunction against Genentech only, in which some inhibitor patients would not be subject to
any injunction. A hearing was held in the US District Court for the District of Delaware on 13 and 14 June 2018 and during that hearing
Baxalta withdrew its request for a preliminary injunction as to the inhibitor patients. On 25 June 2018 Baxalta submitted a new proposed
preliminary injunction order, in which Genentech would be permitted to sell Hemlibra to all inhibitor patients, all non-inhibitor patients
currently on Hemlibra whether through clinical trials or not, and selected non-inhibitor patients who have an additional ‘medically
diagnosed condition’ which rendered factor VIII therapies impracticable. On 7 August 2018 the US District Court ruled against Baxalta,
denying their request for an injunction. On 19 September 2018 Chugai was dismissed from this case. On 1 February 2019 the US District
Court issued a final judgment in favour of Genentech stating that Hemlibra does not infringe Baxalta’s patent based on the Court’s
definition of key terms related to the patent. On 8 February 2019 Baxalta appealed this decision. The Group is vigorously defending itself
in this matter. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
On 28 March 2018, in the case brought by Baxalta against Chugai in Japan, the Tokyo District Court ruled in favour of Chugai, notably that
Hemlibra does not infringe Baxalta’s patent. On 10 May 2018 Baxalta appealed this decision. On 3 October 2019 the Japanese Intellectual
Property High Court issued a ruling upholding the Tokyo District Court’s decision. Baxalta has filed an appeal with the Japanese Supreme
Court. The Group is vigorously defending itself in this matter. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 87Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Securities litigation. On 6 June 2017 a class action was filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey against Roche Holding
Ltd and two of its current officers. The lawsuit brings claims under the federal securities laws in connection with the Group’s public
disclosures, in particular with respect to matters relating to two of Roche’s drugs, Herceptin and Perjeta. On 24 September 2018 the
District Court dismissed the case concluding that there was nothing misleading in those public disclosures. Subsequently plaintiffs filed a
second and a third amended complaint. On 17 June 2019 the US District Court granted the Group’s motion to dismiss the third amended
complaint concluding that there was nothing misleading in the public disclosures. The matter is now concluded.
Iraqi Ministry of Health. In October 2017 F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (‘FHLR’), Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (‘HLR’) and Genentech and
certain other pharmaceutical and/or medical device companies were named as defendants in a complaint filed in the Federal District
Court for the District of Columbia, US, on behalf of US service-members and their relatives who allege that they were killed or injured
in Iraq between 2005 and 2009 (the ‘Iraq lawsuit’). The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the US Anti-Terrorism Act and
various state laws by providing funding for terrorist organisations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and/or
medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health. In addition FHLR received an inquiry in July 2018 from the US Department
of Justice in connection with an anti-corruption investigation relating to activities in Iraq, including interactions with the Iraqi government
and certain of the same matters alleged in the Iraq lawsuit. On 29 October 2019 the US Department of Justice closed its inquiry against
FHLR. The Group is vigorously defending itself in this matter. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Arbitration regarding Actemra/RoActemra against Chugai. In May 2017 Medical Research Council and LifeArc (formerly Medical
Research Council Technology) requested arbitration against Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (‘Chugai’) with an arbitrator being
appointed on 9 August 2017. In April 2018 United Kingdom Research and Innovation (‘UKRI’) was established and became the successor
in title to the Medical Research Council, and the current claimants in the arbitration are LifeArc and UKRI (collectively the ‘Claimants’).
Sums are sought from Chugai for alleged breach of obligations under a collaboration agreement dated 15 August 1990 in connection with
the development of the humanised anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody Actemra/RoActemra. It is claimed that Chugai is
obliged to pay royalties to the Claimants pursuant to the collaboration agreement. In January 2020 Chugai has executed a formal settlement
agreement with the Claimants to end this arbitration. Under the settlement agreement Chugai will make a lump-sum payment to the
Claimants as a sole settlement payment. The terms and conditions of this settlement agreement, including the amount of the settlement
payment, are confidential. The matter is now concluded.

As disclosed in Note 28 and in Note 34, the Group has changed its accounting policies for leases following the implementation of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, effective 1 January 2019.
The Group has applied the cumulative catch-up method for the transition, meaning that the equity attributable to Roche shareholders at 31 December 2018 has not been restated.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 95Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Genentech transaction
The Group completed the purchase of the non-controlling interests in Genentech effective 26 March 2009. Based on the International
Accounting Standard 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ (IAS 27) and consistent with the International Financial Reporting Standard 10
‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ (IFRS 10), which was adopted by the Group in 2013, this transaction was accounted for in full as
an equity transaction. As a consequence, the carrying amount of the consolidated equity of the Group at that time was reduced by
CHF 52.2 billion, of which CHF 8.5 billion was allocated to eliminate the book value of Genentech non-controlling interests. This accounting
effect significantly impacted the Group’s net equity, but has no effect on the Group’s business or its dividend policy.
Share capital
At 31 December 2019 the authorised and issued share capital of Roche Holding Ltd, which is the Group’s parent company, consisted
of 160 million shares with a nominal value of CHF 1.00 each, as in the preceding year. The shares are bearer shares and the Group does
not maintain a register of shareholders. Based on information supplied to the Group, a shareholder group with pooled voting rights
owns 45.01% (2018: 45.01%) of the issued shares. On 5 December 2019 the shareholder group announced that it would continue the
shareholder pooling agreement existing since 1948 with a modified shareholder composition. The duration of the pool was extended
for an indefinite period in 2009. The shareholder group with pooled voting rights holds 72,018,000 shares, corresponding to 45.01% of
the shares issued. This figure does not include any shares without pooled voting rights that are held outside this group by individual
members of the group. Ms Maja Oeri, formerly a member of the pool, holds 8,091,900 shares representing 5.057% of the voting rights
independently of the pool. This is further described in Note 32. Based on information supplied to the Group, Novartis Holding AG,
Basel, owns 33.333% (participation below 331⁄ 3%) of the issued shares (2018: 33.333%).
Non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
At 31 December 2019 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities have been authorised and were in issue as in the preceding year. Under
Swiss company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value, are not part of the share capital and cannot be issued
against a contribution which would be shown as an asset in the balance sheet of Roche Holding Ltd. Each non-voting equity security
confers the same rights as any of the shares to participate in the net profit and any remaining proceeds from liquidation following
repayment of the nominal value of the shares and, if any, participation certificates. In accordance with the law and the Articles of
Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd, the Company is entitled at all times to exchange all or some of the non-voting equity securities into
shares or participation certificates.
Dividends
On 5 March 2019 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of CHF 8.70 per share and non-voting equity security
(2018: CHF 8.30) in respect of the 2018 business year. The distribution to holders of outstanding shares and non-voting equity securities
totalled CHF 7,449 million (2018: CHF 7,094 million) and has been recorded against retained earnings in 2019. The Board of Directors
has proposed dividends for the 2019 business year of CHF 9.00 per share and non-voting equity security which, if approved, would result
in a total distribution to shareholders of CHF 7,763 million. This is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 17 March 2020.

23. Subsidiaries
Chugai
Effective 1 October 2002 the Roche Group and Chugai completed an alliance to create a leading research-driven Japanese
pharmaceutical company, which was formed by the merger of Chugai and Roche’s Japanese pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Nippon Roche.
The merged company is known as Chugai.
Consolidated subsidiary. Chugai is a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group. This is based on the Group’s interest in Chugai at
31 December 2019 of 61.2% (2018: 61.3%) and the Roche relationship with Chugai that is founded on the Basic Alliance, Licensing and
Research Collaboration Agreements.
The common stock of Chugai is publicly traded and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the stock code ‘TSE:4519’.
On 21 January 2020 Chugai has announced a split of its common stock. Effective 1 July 2020 the number of issued shares will increase
from 559,685,889 to 1,679,057,667 (three-for-one split). Chugai prepares financial statements in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) that are filed on a quarterly basis with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to certain consolidation entries
there are minor differences between Chugai’s stand-alone IFRS results and the results of Chugai as consolidated by the Roche Group
in accordance with IFRS.

and have been recorded against non-controlling interests (see Note 24). Dividends paid by Chugai to Roche are eliminated on consolidation
as intercompany items.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 97Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Roche’s relationship with Chugai. Chugai has entered into certain agreements with Roche, which are discussed below:
(1) Basic Alliance Agreement – As part of the Basic Alliance Agreement signed in December 2001, Roche and Chugai entered into
certain arrangements covering the future operation and governance of Chugai. Amongst other matters these cover the following areas:
• The structuring of the alliance.
• Roche’s rights as a shareholder.
• Roche’s rights to nominate members of Chugai’s Board of Directors.
• Certain limitations to Roche’s ability to buy or sell Chugai’s common stock.
Chugai issues additional shares of common stock in connection with its convertible debt and equity compensation plans, and may issue
additional shares for other purposes, which affects Roche’s percentage ownership interest. The Basic Alliance Agreement provides,
amongst other matters, that Chugai will guarantee Roche’s right to maintain its shareholding percentage in Chugai at not less than 50.1%.
(2) Licensing Agreements – Under the Japan Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in December 2001, Chugai has exclusive rights to
market Roche’s pharmaceutical products in Japan. Chugai has the right of first refusal on the development and marketing in Japan of
all development compounds advanced by Roche.
The Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement (excluding Japan and South Korea) signed in May 2002 was revised and the Amended
and Restated Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement (excluding Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) was signed in August 2014.
Under this Agreement Chugai shall offer and Roche has the right of first refusal on the development and marketing of Chugai’s development
compounds in markets outside Japan, excluding South Korea and Taiwan.
Further to these agreements, Roche and Chugai have signed a series of separate agreements for certain specific products. Depending
on the specific circumstances and the terms of the agreement, this may result in payments on an arm’s length basis between Roche and
Chugai, for any or all of the following matters:
• Upfront payments, if a right of first refusal to license a product is exercised.
• Milestone payments, dependent upon the achievement of agreed performance targets.
• Royalties on future product sales.
These specific product agreements may also cover the manufacture and supply of the respective products to meet the other party’s
clinical and/or commercial requirements on an arm’s length basis.
(3) Research Collaboration Agreements – Roche and Chugai have entered into research collaboration agreements in the areas of small-
molecule synthetic drug research and biotechnology-based drug discovery.

Foundation Medicine
On 7 April 2015 the Group acquired a 61.3% controlling interest in Foundation Medicine, Inc. (‘FMI’), a publicly owned US company
based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and entered into an Investor Rights Agreement, a Research and Development Collaboration
Agreement and several Commercial Collaboration Agreements. FMI has been treated as a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group
since that date. At 31 December 2017 the Group’s interest in FMI was 57.5%. The common stock of FMI was publicly traded and was
listed on the Nasdaq under the stock code ‘FMI’. FMI prepared financial statements in accordance with US GAAP that were filed on
a quarterly basis with the SEC. Due to certain consolidation entries there have been differences between FMI’s stand-alone US GAAP
results and the results of FMI as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS.
On 18 June 2018 the Group entered into a merger agreement with FMI to acquire the outstanding shares of FMI’s common stock not
already owned by the Group at a price of USD 137.00 per share in cash. A tender offer was launched on 2 July 2018. On 31 July 2018
the transaction closed and FMI became a 100% owned subsidiary of the Group. It was accounted for in full as an equity transaction
(see Note 6).
Dividends. There were no dividends distributed to third parties holding FMI shares during 2018.
Divestment of subsidiaries
Divestment of subsidiaries – 2018. On 30 November 2018 the Group sold its wholly owned subsidiary Roche Diagnostics IT Solutions
GmbH in Berlin, Germany, to a third party. The total consideration was EUR 2 million, all of which was deferred consideration that
will become due on 30 November 2021. A total loss on divestment of CHF 24 million was reported as global restructuring costs in the
Diagnostics operating segment and included in general and administration.
The Group received deferred consideration of EUR 3 million and EUR 4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, from the sale of the former
subsidiary at the Segrate site, Italy, to a third party.

26. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group’s objective is to provide attractive and competitive post-employment benefits to employees, while at the same time ensuring
that the various plans are appropriately financed and managing any potential impacts on the Group’s long-term financial position. Most
employees are covered by pension plans sponsored by Group companies. The nature of such plans varies according to legal regulations,
fiscal requirements and market practice in the countries in which the employees are employed. Post-employment benefit plans are
classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund or to a third-party financial
institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. All other plans are classified as ‘defined
benefit plans’.
Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans are funded through payments by employees and by the Group to funds administered by third parties.
The Group’s expenses for these plans were CHF 410 million (2018: CHF 419 million). No assets or liabilities are recognised in the Group’s
balance sheet in respect of such plans, apart from regular prepayments and accruals of the contributions withheld from employees’
wages and salaries and of the Group’s contributions. The Group’s major defined contribution plan is the US Roche 401(k) Savings Plan.
Defined benefit plans
Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by payments from Group companies and by employees.
In some cases, notably for the major defined benefit plans in Germany, the plans are unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired
employees directly from its own financial resources. Plans are usually governed by a senior governing body, such as a Board of Trustees,
which is typically composed of both employee and employer representatives. Funding of these plans is determined by local regulations
using independent actuarial valuations. Separate independent actuarial valuations are prepared in accordance with the requirements
of IAS 19 for use in the Group’s financial statements. The Group’s major pension plans are located in Switzerland, the US and Germany,
which in total account for 84% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation (2018: 84%).
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 101Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Pension plans in Switzerland. Current pension arrangements for employees in Switzerland are made through plans governed by the
Swiss Federal Occupational Old Age, Survivors and Disability Pension Act (‘BVG’). The Group’s pension plans are administered by
separate legal foundations, which are funded by regular employee and company contributions. The final benefit is contribution based
with certain minimum guarantees. Due to these minimum guarantees, the Swiss plans are treated as defined benefit plans for the
purposes of these IFRS financial statements, although they have many of the characteristics of defined contribution plans. Where there
is an under-funding, this may be remedied by various measures such as increasing employee and company contributions, lowering
the interest rate on retirement account balances, reducing prospective benefits and a suspension of the early withdrawal facility.
Following a plan change in 2018 the Employee Profit-Sharing Plan (‘Mitarbeiter-Gewinnbeteiligung’) no longer qualifies as a defined
contribution plan but as a defined benefit plan. This resulted in additions to plan assets and defined benefit obligation of approximately
CHF 1.1 billion. In 2018 operating income of CHF 43 million was recorded for past service cost from this plan change in Switzerland.
Of this amount, CHF 31 million was recorded in the Pharmaceuticals Division, CHF 7 million in the Diagnostics Division and CHF 5 million
in Corporate. The past service income was recorded within general and administration.
Pension plans in the US. The Group’s major defined benefit plans in the US have been closed to new members since 2007. New employees
in the US now join the defined contribution plan. The largest of the remaining defined benefit plans are funded pension plans together
with smaller unfunded supplementary retirement plans. The benefits are based on the highest average annual rate of earnings during a
specified period and length of employment. The plans are non-contributory for employees, with the Group making periodic payments
to the plans. Where there is an under-funding, this would normally be remedied by additional company contributions. In 2019 no payments
were made by the Group (2018: USD 186 million). The payments in the comparative period included accelerated contributions to benefit
from a higher tax deduction.
Pension plans in Germany. The Group’s major pension arrangements in Germany are governed by the Occupational Pensions Act
(‘BetrAVG’). These plans are unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources.
These plans are non-contributory for employees. The benefits are based on final salary and length of employment. These plans have
been closed to new members since 2007. They have been replaced by a new plan which is funded by regular employee and company
contributions and administered through a contractual trust agreement. The final benefit is contribution based with a minimum
guarantee. Due to this minimum guarantee, this plan is treated as a defined benefit plan for the purposes of these IFRS financial
statements, although it has many of the characteristics of a defined contribution plan.
Pension plans in the Rest of the World. These represent approximately 11% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation (2018: 11%) and
consist of a number of smaller plans in various countries. Of these the largest are the pension plans at Chugai, which are independently
managed by Chugai, and the main pension plan in the United Kingdom. In 2019 Chugai has made additional voluntary contributions of
JPY 9.0 billion to its pension plans (2018: none). The Chugai plans are fully described in Chugai’s own IFRS financial statements. The UK
pension plan is funded by regular employee and company contributions, with benefits based on final salary and length of employment.
This plan has been closed to new members since 2003 and has been replaced with a defined contribution plan.
Other post-employment benefit (‘OPEB’) plans. These represent approximately 5% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation (2018: 5%)
and consist of post-employment healthcare and life insurance schemes, mainly in the US. These plans are mainly unfunded and/or are
contributory for employees, with the Group reimbursing retired employees directly from its own financial resources. The Group’s major
OPEB plans in the US have been closed to new members since 2011. Part of the costs of these plans is reimbursable under the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. There is no statutory funding requirement for these plans. The Group
is funding these plans to the extent that it is tax efficient. In 2019 no payments were made by the Group to these plans (2018: payments
of USD 40 million). At 31 December 2019 the IFRS funding status was 50% (2018: 47%), including reimbursement rights, for the funded
OPEB plans in the US.

Funding status
The funding of the Group’s various defined benefit plans is the responsibility of the respective senior governing body, such as a Board of
Trustees, and the sponsoring employer, and is managed based on local statutory valuations, which follow the legislation and requirements
of the respective jurisdiction in which the plan is established. Qualified independent actuaries carry out statutory actuarial valuations on
a regular basis. The actuarial assumptions determining the funding status on the statutory basis are regularly assessed by the local senior
governing body. The funding status is closely monitored at a corporate level. The unfunded plans are mainly those in the Group’s German
affiliates, where the fully reserved pension obligations are used for self-financing of the local affiliate’s operations.
The IFRS funding status of the funded defined benefit plans decreased to 92% (2018: 93%).
Reimbursement rights are linked to the post-employment medical plans in the US and represent the expected reimbursement of
the medical expenditure provided under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003.

Plan assets
The responsibility for the investment strategies of funded plans is with the respective senior governance body, such as the Board of
Trustees. Asset-liability studies are performed regularly for all major pension plans. These studies examine the obligations from post-
employment benefit plans, and evaluate various investment strategies with respect to key financial measures such as expected returns,
expected risks, expected contributions, and expected funded status of the plan in an interdependent way. The goal of an asset-liability
study is to select an appropriate asset allocation for the funds held within the plan. The investment strategy is developed to optimise
expected returns, to manage risks and to contain fluctuations in the statutory funded status. Asset-liability studies include strategies to
match the cash flows of the assets with the plan obligations. The Group currently does not use longevity swaps to manage longevity risk.
Plan assets are managed using internal and external asset managers. The actual performance is continually monitored by the pension
fund governance bodies as well as being closely monitored at a corporate level. In these financial statements the difference between
the interest income and actual return on plan assets is a remeasurement that is recorded directly to other comprehensive income. In
2019 the actual return on plan assets was a gain of CHF 2,083 million (2018: loss of CHF 413 million), which excludes the actual return
on reimbursement rights.
The recognition of plan assets is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available from refunds from the plans or reductions
in future contributions to the plans.

Assets are invested in a variety of different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return as follows:
• Equity and debt securities which mainly have quoted market prices (Level 1 fair value hierarchy).
• Property which is primarily in private and commercial property funds which mainly have other observable inputs
(Level 2 fair value hierarchy).
• Cash and money market instruments which are mainly invested with financial institutions with a credit rating no lower than A.
• Other investments which mainly consist of alternatives, mortgages, commodities and insurance contracts. These are used for risk
management purposes and mainly have other observable inputs (Level 2 fair value hierarchy) and unobservable inputs
(Level 3 fair value hierarchy).
Included within the fair value of plan assets are the Group’s shares and non-voting securities with a fair value of CHF 177 million
(2018: CHF 136 million) and debt instruments issued by the Group with a fair value of CHF 5 million (2018: CHF 5 million).
Defined benefit obligation
The defined benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method. This reflects service rendered by employees to the
dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of
benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth and mortality rates. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined
by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds in countries
where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. The corporate or government bonds are denominated in the currency in which
the benefits will be paid, and have maturity terms approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
The Group’s final salary-based defined benefit pension plans in the US, Germany and the United Kingdom have been closed to new
participants. Active employees that had been members of these pension plans at the time these were closed to new participants continue
to accrue benefits in the final salary-based defined benefit pension plans. New employees in the US and UK now join the Group’s
defined contribution plans, while new employees in Germany join the contribution based plan with a minimum guarantee. As a result, the
proportion of the defined benefit obligation which relates to these closed plans is expected to decrease in the future. The defined benefit
pension plans in Switzerland, where the final benefit is contribution based with a minimum guarantee, remain open to new employees.

Actuarial assumptions
The actuarial assumptions used in these financial statements are based on the requirements set out in IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’.
They are unbiased and mutually compatible estimates of variables that determine the ultimate cost of providing post-employment
benefits. They are set on an annual basis by local management, based on advice from actuaries, and are subject to approval by corporate
management and the Group’s actuaries. Actuarial assumptions consist of demographic assumptions on matters such as mortality and
employee turnover, and financial assumptions on matters such as interest rates, salary and benefit levels, inflation rates and costs of
medical benefits. The actuarial assumptions vary based upon local economic and social conditions. The actuarial assumptions used in
the various statutory valuations may differ from these based on local legal and regulatory requirements.
Demographic assumptions. The most significant demographic assumptions relate to mortality rates. The Group’s actuaries use mortality
tables which take into account historic patterns and expected changes, such as further increases in longevity. Rates of employee
turnover, disability and early retirement are based on historical behaviour. The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at
the age of 65 is as follows:

Germany Heubeck tables 2018G projected with CMI model 19.4 19.4 22.7 22.7
The mortality assumptions used for the pension plans in Switzerland were based on BVG 2015 applying the Continuous Mortality
Investigation (‘CMI’) model. A long-term rate of 1.25% (2018: 1.25%) was used for longevity improvements.
The Group used as mortality assumptions for the pension plans in Germany Heubeck tables 2018G applying the CMI model with a
long-term rate of 1.25% for longevity improvements (2018: 1.25%).
Financial assumptions. These are based on market expectations for the period over which the obligations are to be settled.
The assumptions used in the actuarial valuations are shown below.

Ultimate medical cost trend rate (in 2038) 4.49% 4.00% – 4.50% 4.37% 4.00% – 4.50%
Discount rates are determined with reference to interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds in countries
where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. Expected rates of salary increases are based on expected inflation rates with
an adjustment to reflect the Group’s latest expectation of long-term real salary increases taking into account expected inflation rates,
amongst other factors. Expected rates of pension increases are generally linked to the expected inflation rate or the funding status
of the plan. Expected inflation rates are derived by looking at the level of inflation implied by the financial markets in conjunction with
the economists’ price inflation forecasts, historic price inflation as well as other economic variables and circumstances. Medical cost
trend rates take into account the benefits set out in the plan terms and expected future changes in medical costs. Since the Group’s
major post-employment medical plans are for US employees, these rates are driven by developments in the US.
Sensitivity analysis. The measurement of the net defined benefit obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate,
inflation rate, expected mortality and medical cost trend rate assumptions. The following table summarises the impact of a change
in those assumptions on the present value of the defined benefit obligation.

Immediate medical cost trend rate
– 1.00% increase 146 139
– 1.00% decrease (120) (97)
Each sensitivity analysis considers the change in one assumption at a time leaving the other assumptions unchanged. This approach
shows the isolated effect of changing one individual assumption but does not take into account that some assumptions are related.
The method used to carry out the sensitivity analysis is the same as in the prior year.

Cash flows
The Group incurred cash flows from its defined benefit plans as shown in the table below.

Employer contributions, net of reimbursements – funded plans (493) (613)
Benefits paid – unfunded plans (183) (172)
Total cash inflow (outflow) (676) (785)
Based on the most recent actuarial valuations, the Group expects that employer contributions for funded plans in 2020 will be
approximately CHF 413 million, which includes an estimated CHF 20 million of additional voluntary contributions related to the Chugai
benefit plans. Benefits paid for unfunded plans in 2020 are estimated to be approximately CHF 188 million, which mostly relate to
the German defined benefit plans.
27. Equity compensation plans
The Group operates several equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Chugai. IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ requires
that the fair value of all equity compensation plan awards granted to employees be estimated at grant date and recorded as an expense
over the vesting period.

Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights. The Group issues Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) to certain
directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The S-SARs give employees the right to receive
non-voting equity securities reflecting the value of any appreciation in the market price of the non-voting equity securities between the
grant date and the exercise date. Under the Roche S-SAR Plan 180 million S-SARs will be available for issuance over a ten-year period,
starting from 2013. The rights, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a ten-year duration and vest on a phased basis over
four years. Rights granted before 2019 have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years.

Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan. The Group issues Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) awards to certain directors, management and
employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The RSUs, which are non-tradable, represent the right to receive non-voting equity
securities. RSUs vest on a phased basis over four years, subject to performance conditions, if any. RSUs granted before 2019 vest after
a three-year-period. There are currently no performance conditions on outstanding RSUs at 31 December 2019. Under the Roche RSU
Plan 20 million non-voting equity securities will be available for issuance over a ten-year period, starting from 2013. The Roche RSU Plan
also includes a value adjustment which will be an amount equivalent to the sum of shareholder distributions made by the Group during
the vesting period attributable to the number of non-voting equity securities for which an individual award has been granted.

Roche Performance Share Plan. Before 2019 the Group offered future share and non-voting equity security awards (or, at the discretion
of the Board of Directors, their cash equivalent) to certain directors and key senior managers. These are non-tradable equity-settled
awards. Under this programme there remain two annual three-year cycles. The Roche Performance Share Plan (PSP) includes a value
adjustment which is an amount equivalent to the sum of shareholder distributions made by the Group during the vesting period attributable
to the number of shares or non-voting equity securities for which an individual award has been granted. The amount of shares or non-
voting equity securities allocated depends upon the individual’s salary level, the achievement of performance targets linked to the Group’s
Total Shareholder Return (shares and non-voting equity securities combined) relative to the Group’s peers during the three-year period
from the date of the grant, and the discretion of the Board of Directors. Each award granted will result in between zero and two shares
or non-voting equity securities (before value adjustment), depending upon the achievement of the performance targets. In 2019 no new
PSP awards were granted.

Roche Connect. This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the US and certain other countries, to make
regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting equity securities. It is administered by independent third parties. The Group
contributes to the programme, which allows the employees to purchase non-voting equity securities at a discount (usually 20%). The
administrator purchases the necessary non-voting equity securities directly from the market. At 31 December 2019 the administrator held
3.1 million non-voting equity securities (2018: 3.1 million). In 2019 the cost of the plan was CHF 26 million (2018: CHF 24 million).
Roche Option Plan. This programme is used in countries where S-SARs are not used. Awards under this plan give employees the right
to purchase non-voting equity securities at an exercise price specified at the grant date. The options, which are non-tradable equity-settled
awards, have a ten-year duration and vest on a phased basis over four years. Options granted before 2019 have a seven-year duration
and vest on a phased basis over three years.

28. Leases
Implementation of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
Effective 1 January 2019 the Group has implemented IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance, including IAS 17
‘Leases’, and sets out the principles for recognition and measurement of leases. The new standard resulted in an increased volume
of disclosure information in the Annual Financial Statements.
The main effect on the Group as a lessee is that IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model. It requires
a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for its leases. The lease liability reflects the present value of the remaining lease payments,
and the right-of-use asset corresponds to the lease liability, adjusted for payments made before the lease commencement date,
lease incentives and other items related to the lease agreement. As a result right-of-use assets totalling CHF 1,162 million and lease
liabilities totalling CHF 1,194 million were recorded on the balance sheet, effective 1 January 2019.
All transition impacts on the balance sheet are shown in the table below.

The operating lease commitments and finance lease liabilities reported in the 2018 Annual Financial Statements, applying the previous
leasing standard IAS 17, can be reconciled to the lease liabilities recognised on transition to IFRS 16 as shown in the table below.

Roche Finance Report 2019 | 111Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The application of the new standard resulted in part of what has been previously reported as operating lease costs being recorded
as interest expenses. Given the leases involved and the prevailing low interest rate environment, the Group does not currently expect this
effect to be material, with the amount in 2019 being CHF 18 million.
The main impact of the new standard on the statement of cash flows is that cash flows in respect of leases previously reported as
operating leases are reported as part of cash flows from financing activities from 1 January 2019. Previously these were included within
cash flows from operating activities.
The impact of the new standard on operating segment information is given in Note 2.
Key judgements made in calculating the initial application impact of the new standard include assessing whether arrangements contain a
lease and determining the lease term. For determining the lease term, extension and termination options have to be considered along with
all facts and circumstances that may create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option.
Estimates include calculating the discount rate which is based on the incremental borrowing rate.
For the Group as a lessor the application of the new standard does not have any material effects.
Transition approach and use of practical expedients. The Group has applied the cumulative catch-up method for the transition.
The cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 has been recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at
1 January 2019, with no restatement of comparative information. Right-of-use assets are generally measured at an amount equal to the
lease liability, adjusted for payments made before the lease commencement date, lease incentives and other items related to the lease
agreement that were recognised on the balance sheet immediately before the date of initial application. Some right-of-use assets are
measured at their carrying amount as if IFRS 16 had been applied since the lease commencement date, but discounted using the Group’s
incremental borrowing rate at 1 January 2019. Some practical expedients permitted by the standard are used, notably:
• To not reassess upon transition whether an existing contract contains a lease. The definition of a lease under IFRS 16 has been applied
only to contracts entered into or changed on or after 1 January 2019.
• The recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
• For motor vehicles to not separate non-lease components and instead to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single
lease component.
• To apply IAS 37 for onerous leases instead of performing an impairment review.
Presentational changes. As a result of implementing IFRS 16, the Group made a number of presentational changes in 2019, notably to
present ‘Right-of-use assets’ as a separate line item in the balance sheet and to include lease liabilities in other current and non-current
liabilities.
The Group as a lessee
The Group enters into leasing transaction as a lessee mainly for reasons of convenience and flexibility. The Group has good cash
generation ability and it enjoys strong long-term investment grade credit ratings. Therefore it typically does not enter into leasing
arrangements for financing considerations. The main areas of leases that the Group has entered into are for:
• Property – offices and apartments. These are a small number of leases, but represent most of the value.
• Cars – mostly for sales representatives.
• Office equipment – photocopiers and similar.

The maturity analysis of lease liabilities is given in Note 31 in the ‘Liquidity risk’ section.
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are accounted for using the recognition exemption permitted by IFRS 16. Expenses
for short-term leases are recognised on a straight-line basis. These mainly include short-term property leases for employee apartments.
The amount reported in 2019 was CHF 55 million. Expenses for leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis.
These mainly include certain office equipment. The amount reported in 2019 was CHF 22 million.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 113Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Expenses for variable lease payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities was CHF 45 million in 2019. Income from
subleasing right-of-use assets was CHF 10 million in 2019. The Group did not enter into any sale and leaseback transactions.
The major cash flows in respect of leases where the Group is the lessee are shown in the table below.

Cash flows from operating activities include cash flows from short-term lease, leases of low-value assets and variable lease payments.
Cash flows from financing activities include the payment of interest and the principal portion of lease liabilities as well as prepayments
made before the lease commencement date.
Leases committed and not yet commenced. In May 2019 Flatiron Health, Inc. entered into a binding lease agreement with a third
party for the lease of additional office space in New York City, US. According to the agreement the leased space will be made available
at different points in time between 2020 and 2024 with a lease term until February 2031. The initial right-of-use asset and lease liability
related to this agreement are estimated to be approximately USD 103 million based on current assumptions.
In July 2019 Foundation Medicine, Inc. (‘FMI’) entered into a binding lease agreement with a third party for the lease of laboratory and
office space in a building in Boston, US, which is to be constructed by the landlord at the location currently known as ‘Boston Seaport’.
According to the agreement FMI is committed to lease the building for 15 years. The commencement date of the lease is currently
expected to be in 2022. The initial right-of-use asset and lease liability related to this agreement are estimated to be approximately
USD 627 million based on current assumptions.
The Group as a lessor
In the Diagnostics Division the Group enters into certain contracts which include placement of diagnostics instruments, supply of
reagents and other consumables, and servicing arrangements. Depending upon the term of the agreement, the instrument placement
may result in either a finance lease or an operating lease. The Group performs a thorough customer assessment before new leasing
agreements are signed. Usually the Group also retains rights to terminate or modify contracts if certain conditions are not met.
Finance leases. Certain assets, mainly diagnostics instruments, are leased to third parties through finance lease arrangements. Such
assets are reported as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Income from finance leases is recognised as
revenue at amounts that represent the fair value of the instrument, which approximates the present value of the minimum lease payments
under the arrangement. Finance income for finance lease arrangements longer than twelve months is deferred and subsequently recognised
based on a pattern that approximates the use of the effective interest method and recorded in royalty and other operating income.
The following amounts were recorded as income in respect of finance leases.

Income from operating leases is recognised as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term or, when lease revenue is entirely
based on variable lease payments and subject to subsequent reagent sales, as the performance obligation for reagents are satisfied.
Lease income in 2019 was CHF 782 million (2018: CHF 790 million) and included in sales. Of this CHF 583 million (2018: CHF 581 million)
relates to variable lease payments not depending upon an index or rate.

30. Statement of cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities arise from the Group’s primary activities in the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics Divisions. These
are calculated using the indirect method by adjusting the Group’s operating profit for any operating income and expenses that are not
cash flows (for example depreciation, amortisation and impairment) in order to derive the cash generated from operations. This and other
operating cash flows are shown in the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flows also include income taxes paid on all activities.

As disclosed in Note 28 and in Note 34, the Group has changed its accounting policies for leases following the implementation of
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, effective 1 January 2019. The Group has applied the cumulative catch-up method for the transition, meaning
that the comparative statement of cash flows for the year ended 31 December 2018 has not been restated. The main impact of the
new standard on the statement of cash flows is that cash flows in respect of leases where the Group is the lessee, which were
previously reported as operating leases, are reported as part of cash flows from financing activities from 1 January 2019. Previously
these were included within cash flows from operating activities.
Cash flows from investing activities
Cash flows from investing activities are principally those arising from the Group’s investments in property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets, and from the acquisition and divestment of subsidiaries, associates and businesses. Cash flows connected with
the Group’s portfolio of marketable securities and other investments are also included, as are any interest and dividend payments
received in respect of these securities and investments. These cash flows indicate the Group’s net reinvestment in its operating assets
and the cash flow effects of business combinations and divestments, as well as the cash generated by the Group’s other investments.

Cash flows from financing activities
Cash flows from financing activities are primarily the proceeds from the issue and repayment of the Group’s equity and debt instruments.
They also include interest payments and dividend payments on these instruments. Cash flows from short-term financing are also included.
These cash flows indicate the Group’s transactions with the providers of its equity and debt financing. Cash flows from lease payments
are also included within financing activities. Following the implementation of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (see above), cash flows in respect of leases
where the Group is the lessee, which were previously reported as operating leases, are reported as part of cash flows from financing
activities, effective 1 January 2019. Cash flows from short-term borrowings are shown as a net movement, as these consist of a large
number of transactions with short maturity.

31. Risk management
Group risk management
Risk management is a fundamental element of the Group’s business practice on all levels and encompasses different types of risks.
At Group level, risk management is an integral part of the long-term forecasting and controlling processes. Material risks are monitored
and regularly discussed with the Corporate Executive Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising from its underlying operations and corporate finance activities. The Group’s
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices as well as
the creditworthiness and the solvency of the Group’s counterparties.
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies reviewed by the boards of directors of Roche and Chugai
as appropriate to their areas of statutory responsibility. These policies cover credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. The policies
provide guidance on risk limits, types of authorised financial instruments and monitoring procedures. As a general principle, the
policies prohibit the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Policy implementation and day-to-day
risk management are carried out by the relevant treasury functions and regular reporting on these risks is performed by the relevant
accounting and controlling functions within Roche and Chugai.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations, causing financial losses for
the Group. The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses of liquid funds deposited with or invested in such
counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering netting agreements and
without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements, is equal to the carrying value of the Group’s financial assets.
The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the counterparty is unlikely to pay its obligations to the Group in full.
In assessing whether a counterparty is in default, the Group considers both qualitative and quantitative indicators (e.g. overdue status)
that are based on data developed internally and for certain financial assets are also obtained from external sources. A major part of the
Group’s receivables which are past due more than 90 days relate to public customers. Risk of default of public customers is considered
low. The Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate
for this particular customer segment.
Accounts receivable. At 31 December 2019 the Group has trade receivables of CHF 11.3 billion (2018: CHF 10.7 billion). These are
subject to a policy of active credit risk management which focuses on the assessment of country risk, credit availability, ongoing credit
evaluation and account monitoring procedures. The objective of trade receivables management is to maximise the collection of unpaid
amounts.
The Group uses an allowance matrix to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for all trade receivables. The expected credit
loss (‘ECL’) rate is based on the Group’s historical experience and the Group’s expectation of economic conditions over the period until
receivables are expected to be paid.

At 31 December 2019 the Group’s combined trade receivables balance with three US national wholesale distributors, McKesson Corp.,
AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Cardinal Health, Inc., was equivalent to CHF 2.9 billion representing 26% of the Group’s consolidated
trade receivables (2018: CHF 2.7 billion representing 25%). There is no other significant concentration of counterparty credit risk due to
the Group’s large number of customers and their wide geographical spread. Risk limits and exposures are continuously monitored by
country and by the nature of counterparties. The Group obtains credit insurance and similar enhancements when appropriate to protect
the collection of trade receivables. At 31 December 2019 no collateral was considered to measure expected credit losses for trade
receivables (2018: none).
Since 2010 there have been financial difficulties in Southern European countries, notably Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. The Group is
a leading supplier to the healthcare sectors in these countries and has trade receivables of CHF 0.8 billion (2018: CHF 0.8 billion) with the
public and private customers in these countries. The Group uses different measures to improve collections in these countries, including
intense communication with customers, factoring, negotiations of payment plans, charging of interest for late payments, and legal
actions.
The nature and geographic location of counterparties to accounts receivable that are not overdue or impaired are shown in the table
below. These include the balances with US national wholesalers and Southern Europe public customers described above.

Cash and marketable securities (excluding equity securities). At 31 December 2019 the Group has cash and marketable securities
(excluding equity securities) of CHF 11.8 billion (2018: CHF 13.1 billion). These are subject to a policy of restricting exposures to high-
quality counterparties and setting defined limits for individual counterparties. These limits and counterparty credit ratings are reviewed
regularly.
Cash and cash equivalents are held with banks and financial institutions, which are predominantly rated as investment grade
(96% and 97% in 2019 and 2018, respectively), based on Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s ratings. Cash and short-term time deposits are
subject to rules which limit the Group’s exposure to individual financial institutions.
Impairment on cash and cash equivalents is measured on a 12-month expected credit losses (‘ECL’) basis with a reference to
external credit ratings of the counterparties, and reflect the short maturities of the exposures. The Group considers that its cash
and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on these external credit ratings.
120 | Roche Finance Report 2019Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Investments in marketable securities (excluding equity securities) are entered into on the basis of guidelines with regard to liquidity,
quality and maximum amount. As a general rule, the Group invests only in high-quality securities with adequate liquidity and with
counterparties that have a credit rating of at least Baa3 from Moody’s and BBB- from Standard & Poor’s.
The credit risk of the counterparties with external ratings below investment grade or non-rated is closely monitored and reviewed
on an individual basis.

1) The loss allowance related to fair value through OCI does not affect the carrying amount of marketable securities (excluding equity securities) but is booked against
corresponding OCI reserve instead.
Debt securities at amortised cost and those at fair value through OCI are investment grade and therefore considered to be low risk,
and thus the impairment allowance is determined at 12-month expected credit losses (‘ECL’) with a reference to external credit ratings
of the counterparties. There were no debt securities for which the Group observed a significant increase in the credit risk which would
require the application of the lifetime expected credit losses impairment model. In addition, there were no material movements in the loss
allowance in 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Master netting agreements. The Group enters into derivative transactions and collateral agreements under International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements with the respective counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty risk.
Under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same
currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria
for offsetting in the balance sheet as the Group does not have a currently enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, because the
right to offset is only enforceable on the occurrence of future events, such as a default or other credit events.
Contract terms. At 31 December 2019 there are no significant financial assets whose terms have been renegotiated (2018: none).
Impairment losses on financial assets excluding equity investments/securities. During 2019 there were no impairment losses
(2018: impairment losses of CHF 1 million).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time. The Group’s
approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements at any point in
time. Roche and Chugai enjoy strong credit quality and are rated by at least one major credit rating agency. The ratings will permit
efficient access to the international capital markets in the event of major financing requirements. At 31 December 2019 the Group has
an unused committed credit line with various financial institutions totalling CHF 7.6 billion (2018: CHF 7.7 billion), of which CHF 7.3 billion
(2018: CHF 7.4 billion) serve as a back-stop line for the commercial paper program. On 3 July 2019 the previously existing committed
credit lines were refinanced by one new committed credit line with an initial maturity of five years.

Take-or-pay commitments. The Group has entered into contract manufacturing agreements with various companies to further develop
manufacturing capacity and flexibility, mainly in the Pharmaceuticals Division. There are future minimum take-or-pay commitments within
some of these agreements with a total potential commitment from the Group of CHF 1.4 billion at 31 December 2019 (2018: CHF 1.4 billion).
Market risk
Market risk arises from changing market prices, mainly foreign exchange rates and interest rates, of the Group’s financial assets
or financial liabilities which affect the Group’s financial result and equity.
Value-at-Risk. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to measure the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. VaR indicates the
value range within which a given financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices.
VaR is calculated using a historical simulation approach and for each scenario, all financial instruments are fully valued and the total
change in value and earnings is determined. VaR calculations are based on a 95% confidence level and a holding period of 20 trading
days over the past ten years. This holding period reflects the time required to change the corresponding risk exposure, should this be
deemed appropriate.
Actual future gains and losses associated with our treasury activities may differ materially from the VaR analyses due to the inherent
limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes to interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity investment
prices, particularly in periods of high market volatilities. Furthermore, VaR does not include the effect of changes in credit spreads.

VaR – Foreign exchange component 44 17
VaR – Other price component 34 32
Diversification (72) (40)
VaR – Total market risk 164 321
The interest rate component decreased due to the repayment and early redemption of long-term debt in the second half of 2019 as
well as due to the reduction in the underlying interest rates across major currencies. The foreign exchange component increased due
to an unfavourable exposure mix. The other price component remained stable.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group uses the Swiss franc as its reporting currency and as a result is exposed to movements in foreign currencies, mainly the
US dollar, Japanese yen and euro. The Group’s foreign exchange risk management strategy is to preserve the economic value of its
current and future assets and to minimise the volatility of the Group’s financial result. The primary focus of the Group’s foreign exchange
risk management activities is on hedging transaction exposures arising through foreign currency flows or monetary positions held in foreign
currencies. The Group uses forward contracts, foreign exchange options and cross-currency swaps to hedge transaction exposures.
Application of these instruments intends to continuously immunise against unfavourable developments of foreign exchange rates.
Interest rate risk
The Group mainly raises debt on a fixed rate basis for bonds and notes. The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates, mainly for
its US dollar, Swiss franc and euro floating rate financial instruments and short-term debt. The Group’s interest rate risk management
strategy is to optimise the net interest result. The Group may use forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps to hedge its interest
rate exposures. Depending on the interest rate environment of major currencies, the Group will use these instruments to generate an
appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposures.
Other price risk
Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities. The Group manages the price risk through placing limits
on individual and total equity investments. These limits are defined both as a percentage of total liquid funds and as an absolute number
for individual equity investments.
Capital management
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total capitalisation, being the sum of debt plus equity, including non-controlling
interests. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide benefits for patients and returns to
investors.
• To provide an adequate return to investors based on the level of risk undertaken.
• To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver future benefits for patients and
returns to investors.
• To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 123Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The capitalisation is reported to senior management as part of the Group’s regular internal management reporting and is shown
in the table below.

The Group is not subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements as known in the financial services industry. The Group has
a majority shareholding in Chugai (see Note 23). Chugai is a public company and its objectives, policies and processes for managing
its own capital are determined by Chugai management.

Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
• Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
• Level 2 – observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
• Level 3 – unobservable inputs.

Level 1 financial assets consist of treasury bills, bonds and quoted shares. Level 2 financial assets consist primarily of commercial paper,
certificates of deposit and derivative financial instruments.
The Group determines Level 2 fair values using the following valuation techniques:
• Marketable securities and derivative financial instruments are based on valuation models that use observable market data for interest
rates, yield curves, foreign exchange rates and implied volatilities for similar instruments at the measurement date.
• Equity investments at fair value through OCI and at fair value through profit or loss are based on a valuation model that uses the most
recently published observable market data.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period during which the transfer
has occurred. There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and vice versa during the year (2018: none).

During 2019 contingent consideration provisions decreased mainly due to the reversal of some of the provisions and to the payment of
milestones. Payments of CHF 172 million were made during 2019 for milestones related to the Dutalys, Santaris, Ariosa, GeneWeave,
Genia and other acquisitions. There was CHF 146 million of income, net, mainly from the reversal of the provisions related to the Santaris,
Ariosa and GeneWeave acquisitions.
Contingent consideration arrangements
The Group is party to certain contingent consideration arrangements arising from business combinations. The fair values are determined
considering the expected payments, discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted average discount rate of 3.0% (2018: 3.6%).
The expected payments are determined by considering the possible scenarios of forecast sales and other performance criteria, the
amount to be paid under each scenario, and the probability of each scenario. The significant unobservable inputs are the forecast sales,
other performance criteria and the risk-adjusted discount rate. The estimated fair value would increase if the forecast sales or other
performance criteria rates were higher or the risk-adjusted discount rate was lower. At 31 December 2019 the total potential payments
under contingent consideration arrangements could be up to CHF 0.5 billion (2018: CHF 1.0 billion) as follows:

Hedge accounting
As described above the Group’s risk management strategy is to hedge the transaction exposures arising through foreign currency flows
or monetary positions held in foreign currencies as well as to generate an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposures. The level
of hedging depends on market conditions and business requirements of the Group. The Group designates a specific interest rate risk
management objective to ensure that a predetermined level of its interest rate risk exposure is at a floating rate.
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness
assessments at each reporting date to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.
The Group performs a qualitative assessment of the hedge effectiveness using a critical terms match method. As the critical terms
of the hedged items and the hedging instruments match, the Group concludes that risks being hedged for the hedged items and the
hedging instruments are sufficiently aligned, that there is no inherent mismatch in the hedging relationship and that a 100% hedge
ratio applies both for the actual quantities hedged and for the hedge accounting.

The ineffective portion of the hedge accounting is recognised in the income statement and included in other financial income (expense).
It is measured using the hypothetical derivative method for cash flow hedges and the cumulative dollar offset method for fair value
hedges. At 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018, respectively, none of the above potential sources of ineffectiveness, individually
or collectively, resulted in material amounts of actual ineffectiveness being reported for any hedge accounting relationships.
The table below shows fair values and nominal amounts of derivative financial instruments, including a range of the maturity of the
nominal amount of the hedging instruments, which are designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge and a fair value hedge.
At 31 December the Group has the following cash flow hedges and fair value hedges which are designated in a qualifying hedge

The fair values of derivative financial instruments used for hedge accounting are included in other current assets (see Note 16) or
other current liabilities (see Note 19). The Group’s approach to managing market risk, including interest rate risk and foreign currency
risk, is discussed in the ‘Market risk’ section in this Note.
Cash flow hedges. The Group has entered into cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk on some of
the bonds and notes issued by the Group which are denominated in euro. At 31 December 2019 such instruments are recorded as
a net fair value liability of CHF 119 million (2018: net fair value liability of CHF 67 million). There was no ineffective portion.
Chugai has entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge a part of its foreign translation exposure to Swiss franc and US dollar.
At 31 December 2019 such instruments are recorded as fair value assets of CHF 40 million and as fair value liabilities of CHF 56 million
(2018: fair value assets of CHF 13 million and fair value liabilities of CHF 12 million). There was no ineffective portion.

130 | Roche Finance Report 2019Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Fair value hedges. The Group has entered into some interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in the fair value of some of
its fixed-term debt instruments in respect of a benchmark interest rate. At 31 December 2019 such instruments are recorded as fair
value assets of CHF 8 million (2018: fair value assets of CHF 7 million and fair value liabilities of CHF 22 million). During 2019 fair value
adjustments of CHF 23 million were recorded on these interest rate swaps (2018: CHF 2 million). All interest rate swaps currently held
for applying hedge accounting are referenced to a benchmark rate other than the London InterBank Offered Rate (‘LIBOR’) except for
the hedging instrument hedging a portion of EUR 100 million of the 6.5% notes due 4 March 2021. As the fair value hedge had been
highly effective since inception, the result of the interest rate swaps was largely offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt
instruments. The Group’s approach to managing market risk, including interest rate risk, is discussed in the ‘Market risk’ section in this Note.

On 13 December 2019 the Group resolved to exercise its option to call for early redemption of the 2.0% fixed rate notes with a principal
amount of USD 0.6 billion at par three months before the scheduled due date of 13 March 2020 (see Note 21). This resulted in a
termination of the fair value hedge accounting applied to the interest rate swaps with a nominal value of USD 600 million and a fair value
of less than CHF 1 million at the date of the termination.
Net investment hedges. The Group does not have any net investment hedges.

34. Significant accounting policies
Consolidation policy
Subsidiaries are all companies over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Companies acquired during the year are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group, and subsidiaries to
be divested are included up to the date on which control passes from the Group. Intercompany balances, transactions and resulting
unrealised income are eliminated in full. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they
occur after control has already been obtained and if they do not result in a loss of control. Associates are companies over which the
Group exercises, or has the power to exercise, significant influence, but which it does not control, and they are accounted for using the
equity method.
Segment reporting
For the purpose of segment reporting the Group’s Corporate Executive Committee (CEC) is considered to be the Group’s Chief Operating
Decision Maker. The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the organisation units for which information is reported
to the CEC on a regular basis. The information provided is used as the basis of the segment revenue and profit disclosures reported in
Note 2, with the geographic analysis based on the location of customers. Selected segment balance sheet information is also routinely
provided to the CEC.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis. Operating assets and liabilities consist of property, plant
and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade receivables/payables, inventories and other assets and liabilities, such as provisions,
which can be reasonably attributed to the reported operating segments. Non-operating assets and liabilities mainly include current
and deferred income tax balances, post-employment benefit assets/liabilities and financial assets/liabilities such as cash, marketable
securities, investments and debt.

Foreign currency translation
The Annual Financial Statements are presented in Swiss francs. Most Group companies use their local currency as their functional
currency. Certain Group companies use other currencies (such as US dollar, Swiss franc or euro) as their functional currency where
this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Local transactions in other currencies are
initially reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses from the settlement of such transactions and
gains and losses on translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are included in income, except when
they are qualifying cash flow hedges or arise on monetary items that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign
entity. In such cases the gains and losses are deferred into other comprehensive income.
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using functional currencies other than Swiss francs are translated into
Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange. The income statement and statement of cash flows are translated at the average rates
of exchange for the year. Translation differences due to the changes in exchange rates between the beginning and the end of the year
and the difference between net income translated at the average and year-end exchange rates are taken directly to other comprehensive
income.
Revenue
Sales. Revenue from the sale of goods supplied (product sales) and services rendered are recoded as ‘Sales’.
Sales are recognised when a promise in a customer contract (performance obligation) has been satisfied by transferring control over
the promised goods and services to the customer. Control over a promised good or service refers to the ability to direct the use of, and
obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, those goods or services. Control is usually transferred upon shipment, delivery to,
upon receipt of goods by the customer, or as services are rendered, in accordance with the delivery and acceptance terms agreed with
the customers. For goods subject to installation, such as instruments sold in the Diagnostics Division, sales are generally recognised
upon completion of the installation at the customer’s site and customer acceptance. The amount of sales to be recognised (transaction
price) is based on the consideration the Group expects to receive in exchange for its goods and services, excluding amounts collected on
behalf of third parties such as value added taxes or other taxes directly linked to sales. If a contract contains more than one performance
obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on their relative stand-alone selling prices.
Instruments in the Diagnostics Division may be sold together with other goods such as reagents and other consumables as well as
services under a single contract or under several contracts that are combined for revenue recognition purposes. Sales are recognised
upon satisfaction of each of the performance obligations in the contract. Instruments are either sold in cash and instalment sales
transactions or otherwise made available to customers under finance lease and operating lease transactions.
• Finance leases: Arrangements in which the Group transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the customer are
treated as finance lease arrangements. Income from finance leases is recognised as revenue at amounts that represent the fair value
of the instrument, which approximates the present value of the minimum lease payments under the arrangement. As interest rates
embedded in finance lease arrangements are approximately market rates, income from finance leases is comparable to revenue for
outright sales. Finance income for finance lease arrangements longer than twelve months is deferred and subsequently recognised based
on a pattern that approximates the use of the effective interest rate method and recorded in royalty and other operating income.
• Operating leases: Income from operating leases is recognised as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term or, when lease
revenue is entirely variable and subject to subsequent reagent sales, as the performance obligation to deliver reagents is satisfied.
Sales, net of discounts, are based on estimates regarding the related obligations, including their stand-alone selling prices or fair values.
It requires judgement to determine when different obligations are satisfied, including whether enforceable purchase commitments for
further obligations exist and when they arise.
For contracts with distributors, no sales are recognised when goods are physically transferred to the distributor under a consignment
arrangement, or if the distributor acts as an agent. In such cases, sales are recognised when control over the goods transfers to
the end-customer, and distributor’s commissions are presented within marketing and distribution. Commissions and similar payments
to distributors acting as principals are deducted from sales unless such payments are in exchange for a distinct service.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 139Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The consideration received by the Group in exchange for its goods and services may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration is only
recognised when it is considered highly probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur once the underlying uncertainty
related to variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The most common elements of variable consideration in the Pharmaceuticals
Division are listed below:
• Government and regulatory mandatory price reductions. These consist of mandatory price reductions. The major elements are
340B Drug Discount Program, Medicaid and other plans in the US.
• Contractual price reductions. These include rebates and chargebacks that are the result of contractual agreements that are primarily
volume based and performance based.
• Cash discounts. These include credits offered to wholesalers for remitting payment on their purchases within contractually defined
incentive periods.
• Customer returns reserves. These are allowances established for expected product returns.
Revenues from product sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts and estimates of
product returns, all of which are established at the time of sale. All product sales allowances are based on estimates of the amounts
earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration historical experience, current contractual and
statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends such as competitive pricing and new product introductions, estimated
inventory levels, and the shelf life of products. If actual future results vary, these estimates need to be adjusted, with an effect on sales
and earnings in the period of the adjustment. Sales reductions that are expected to be withheld by the customer upon settlement, such
as contractual price reductions and cash discounts, are recorded in the balance sheet as a deduction from trade receivables. Sales
reductions that are separately payable to customers, governmental health authorities or healthcare regulatory authorities are recorded
in the balance sheet as accrued liabilities. Provisions for sales returns are recorded in the balance sheet as other provisions.
The Group recognises a deferred income (contract liability) if consideration has been received (or has become receivable) before the
Group transfers the promised goods or services to the customer. Deferred income mainly relates to remaining performance obligations
for goods free of charge under certain patient access or similar programmes, reagents and other consumables and services.
Remaining performance obligations in (partially) unsatisfied long-term contracts are either included in deferred income or are related
to amounts the Group expects to receive for goods and services that have not yet been transferred to customers under existing, non-
cancellable or otherwise enforceable contracts. These are mainly associated with contracts with minimum purchase commitments related
to reagents and consumables for previously sold instruments as well as monitoring and maintenance services. For contracts that have
an original duration of one year or less, the Group has elected the practical expedient to not disclose the transaction price for remaining
performance obligations at the end of each reporting period and at which point in time the Group expects to recognise these sales.
Royalty and other operating income. Royalty and other operating income includes royalty income, income from out-licensing
agreements and income from disposal of products and other items.
Royalty income earned through a licence is recognised as the underlying sales are recorded by the licensee.
Income from out-licensing agreements typically arises from the receipt of upfront, milestone and other similar payments from third
parties for granting a licence to product- or technology-related intellectual property (IP). Out-licensing agreements may be entered
into with no further obligation or may include commitments to conduct research, late-stage development, regulatory approval,
co-marketing or manufacturing. Licences granted are usually rights to use IP and are generally unique. Therefore the basis of allocating
revenue to performance obligations makes use of the residual approach. Upfront payments and other licensing fees are usually
recognised upon granting the licence unless some of the income shall be deferred for other performance obligations using the residual
approach. Such deferred income is released and recognised as revenue when other performance obligations are satisfied. Milestone
payments are typically received upon reaching a specific scientific milestone (development milestone) or upon achieving a certain annual
sales milestone (commercial milestone). Development milestone income is recognised at the point in time when it is highly probable that
the respective milestone event criteria is achieved, and the risk of revenue reversal is considered remote. Commercial milestone income
is accrued and recognised as revenue when it is highly probable that the annual sales milestone is reached during the period.
Payments received for the disposal of product and similar rights are recognised as revenue upon transfer of control over such rights.
To the extent that some of these payments relate to other performance obligations, a portion is deferred using the residual approach
and recognised as revenue when or as activities such as manufacturing or other services are rendered. Income from profit-sharing
arrangements with collaboration partners is recognised as underlying sales and cost of sales are recorded by the collaboration partners.
Also included is income from other services rendered which are usually not part of the Group’s primary business activities, to the extent
that such revenue is not recorded under ‘Sales’, and is recognised when control transfers and performance obligations are satisfied.
140 | Roche Finance Report 2019Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and related production overheads of goods sold and services rendered.
Royalties, alliance and collaboration expenses, including all collaboration profit-sharing arrangements are also reported as part of cost of
sales. Start-up costs between validation and the achievement of normal production capacity are expensed as incurred.
Research and development
Internal research and development activities are expensed as incurred for the following:
• Internal research costs incurred for the purpose of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.
• Internal development costs incurred for the application of research findings or other knowledge to plan and develop new products
for commercial production. The development projects undertaken by the Group are subject to technical, regulatory and other
uncertainties, such that, in the opinion of management, the criteria for capitalisation as intangible assets are not met prior to obtaining
marketing approval by the regulatory authorities in major markets.
• Post-marketing studies after regulatory approval, such as phase IV costs in the pharmaceuticals business, generally involve safety
surveillance and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives marketing approval to be sold. They may be required by
regulatory authorities or may be undertaken for safety or commercial reasons. The costs of such post-marketing studies are not
capitalised as intangible assets as, in the opinion of management, they do not generate separately identifiable incremental future
economic benefits that can be reliably measured.
Acquired in-process research and development resources obtained through in-licensing arrangements, business combinations or separate
asset purchases are capitalised as intangible assets. The acquired asset must be controlled by the Group, be separately identifiable and
expected to generate future economic benefits, even if uncertainty exists as to whether the research and development will ultimately result
in a marketable product. Consequently, upfront and milestone payments to third parties for pharmaceutical products or compounds
before regulatory marketing approval are recognised as intangible assets. Assets acquired through such arrangements are measured
on the basis set out in the ‘Intangible assets’ policy. Subsequent internal research and development costs incurred post-acquisition
are treated in the same way as other internal research and development costs. If research and development are embedded in contracts
for strategic alliances, the Group carefully assesses whether upfront or milestone payments constitute funding of research and
development work or acquisition of an asset.
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits include wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, profit sharing
and bonuses, and non-monetary benefits for current employees. The costs are recognised within the operating results when the
employee has rendered the associated service. The Group recognises a liability for profit sharing and bonuses where contractually
obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Long-term employee benefits include long-service or sabbatical leave, long-service benefits and long-term disability benefits.
The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment. Any changes in the carrying value of other long-term
employee benefit liabilities are recognised within the operating results.
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever
an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. Termination costs are recognised at the earlier of when
the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of the benefits or when the Group recognises any related restructuring costs.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
For defined contribution plans the Group contributions are recognised within the operating results when the employee has rendered
the associated service. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments
is available.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 141Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
For defined benefit plans the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair
value of the plan assets. All changes in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as they occur as follows:
Recognised in the income statement:
• Current service cost is charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results.
• Past service cost, including curtailment gains or losses, is recognised immediately in general and administration within the operating
results.
• Settlement gains or losses are recognised in general and administration within the operating results.
• Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is recognised in financing costs.
Recognised in other comprehensive income:
• Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments (the difference between previous assumptions and what has actually
occurred) and changes in actuarial assumptions.
• The return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability.
• Any change in the limit on the recognition of plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is comprised of interest income on plan assets, interest cost on the defined benefit
obligation and interest on the effect of the limit on the recognition of pension assets. The net interest is calculated using the same
discount rate that is used in calculating the defined benefit obligation, applied to the net defined liability at the start of the period, taking
into account any changes from contribution or benefit payments.
Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to use the
surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan.
Equity compensation plans
The fair value of all equity compensation awards granted to employees is estimated at the grant date and recorded as an expense over
the vesting period. The expense is charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results. For equity-settled
plans, an increase in equity is recorded for this expense and any subsequent cash flows from exercises of vested awards are recorded as
changes in equity.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction, and include all costs directly attributable to
bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
These include items such as costs of site preparation, installation and assembly costs, and professional fees. The net costs of testing
whether the asset is functioning properly, including validation costs, are also included in the initially recorded cost of construction.
Interest and other borrowing costs incurred with respect to qualifying assets are capitalised and included in the carrying value of the
assets. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis, except for land, which is not depreciated. The estimated
useful lives of major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
Land improvements 40 years
Buildings 10–50 years
Machinery and equipment 4–15 years
Diagnostic instruments 3–5 years
Office equipment 3–6 years
Motor vehicles 5–8 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate components.
The estimated useful lives of the assets are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation charges are accelerated.
Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
142 | Roche Finance Report 2019Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Leases
Where the Group is the lessee – policy applicable from 1 January 2019. At inception of a contract the Group assesses whether
a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified
asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability
for each contract that is, or contains, a lease at the lease commencement date, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value
assets. Payments for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over
the term of the respective lease. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments that are not
paid at the lease commencement date. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily
determinable, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate in the respective markets. Lease payments include fixed payments, variable
payments that depend on an index or rate known at the lease commencement date and payments from exercising extension or purchase
options if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised costs using the effective
interest method. It is remeasured, with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset, when there is a change in future
lease payments following a contract renegotiation, a change of an index or rate or a reassessment of options. The right-of-use asset is
initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any payments made at or before the lease
commencement date and which includes any initial direct costs incurred and expected costs of obligations to dismantle, remove or
refurbish the underlying asset, less any incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the lease
commencement date over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset. Right-of-use assets are assessed for
impairment whenever there is an indication for impairment.
Where the Group is the lessee – policy applicable before 1 January 2019. The Group classified leases that substantially transferred
all of the risks and rewards of ownership as finance leases. Finance leases were capitalised as property, plant and equipment at the start
of the lease at fair value, or the present value of the minimum lease payments, if lower. The rental obligation, net of finance charges, was
reported within debt. Finance lease assets were depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its useful life. The interest element
of the lease payment was charged against income over the lease term based on the effective interest rate method. All other leases were
classified as operating leases. Operating leases existed when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership were not transferred
to the Group. Payments made under operating leases were charged against income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where the Group is the lessor. Certain assets, mainly Diagnostics instruments, are leased to third-party customers through both
finance and operating lease arrangements. Such transactions may be entered into in separate contracts or in combined contracts including
reagents and other consumables and services. The treatment of leasing transactions is mainly determined by whether the lease is
considered to be an operating or finance lease. In making this assessment, management looks at the substance of the lease, as well as
the legal form, and makes a judgement about whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. If this is
the case, then the lease is a finance lease. If not, then it is an operating lease. Arrangements which do not take the legal form of a lease
but that nevertheless convey the right to use an asset are also covered by such assessments.
• Finance leases: Finance lease assets are reported as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Income from
finance leases is recognised as revenue at amounts that represent the stand-alone selling price of the instrument, which approximates
the present value of the minimum lease payments under the arrangement. Minimum lease payments exclude any variable lease payments
or contingent rent. Finance income for finance lease arrangements longer than twelve months is deferred and subsequently recognised
based on a pattern that approximates the use of the effective interest method and recorded in royalty and other operating income.
• Operating leases: Income from operating leases is recognised as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term at amounts
that represent the stand-alone selling price of the instrument, which approximates the present value of the minimum lease payments
under the arrangement. Minimum lease payments exclude any variable lease payments or contingent rent. When lease revenue is
entirely based on variable lease payments and subject to subsequent reagent sales, it is recognised as the performance obligations for
reagents are satisfied.
Sales, net of discounts, are based on estimates regarding the related obligations, including their stand-alone selling prices. It requires
judgement to determine when different obligations are satisfied, including whether enforceable purchase commitments for further
obligations exist and when they arise.
Mergers and acquisitions
Business combinations. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. At the date of the
acquisition the Group initially recognises the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling
interest in the acquired business. The consideration transferred is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. Where the Group
does not acquire 100% ownership of the acquired business, non-controlling interests are recorded either at fair value or as the
proportion of the fair value of the acquired net assets attributable to the non-controlling interest. Directly attributable acquisition-related
costs are expensed as incurred within general and administration expenses.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 143Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Asset acquisitions. Asset acquisitions are acquisitions of legal entities that do not qualify as business combinations. At the date of
the acquisition the Group initially recognises the individual identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The cost to the Group at
the date of the acquisition is allocated to the individual identifiable assets and liabilities on the basis of their relative fair values at the
date of the acquisition. Subsequent consideration for performance-related development milestones is recognised as intangible assets
when the specific milestones have been achieved. Such transactions do not give rise to goodwill. Material directly attributable acquisition-
related costs are included in the cost of the acquired assets.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises in a business combination and is the excess of the consideration transferred to acquire the business over the underlying
fair value of the net identified assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually and upon the
occurrence of an indication of impairment.
Intangible assets
Purchased patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Assets that have been acquired
through a business combination are initially recorded at fair value. Once available for use, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-
line basis over their useful lives. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date. The estimated useful life is the
lower of the legal duration and the economic useful life. The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are regularly reviewed. Estimated
useful lives of major classes of amortisable intangible assets are as follows:
Product intangibles in use up to 20 years
Marketing intangibles in use up to 15 years
Technology intangibles in use up to 20 years
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets
An impairment assessment is carried out when there is evidence that an asset may be impaired. In addition, intangible assets that are
not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. When the recoverable amount of an asset, being the higher of its fair value
less costs of disposal and its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value is reduced to its recoverable amount.
This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. Value in use is calculated using estimated cash flows, generally
over a five-year period, with extrapolating projections for subsequent years. These are discounted using an appropriate long-term interest
rate. When an impairment loss arises, the useful life of the asset is reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation/amortisation charge
is accelerated. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring
after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement as an
impairment reversal.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is assessed for impairment at each reporting date and is additionally tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is allocated to
cash-generating units and when the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, being the higher of its fair value less costs of
disposal or its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value of the goodwill is reduced to its recoverable amount.
This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. When an acquired business that is included within a cash-
generating unit permanently ceases to operate then it is treated as a disposal of that business. For separately identifiable goodwill that
was generated on the initial acquisition of that business and where all of the factors that made up that goodwill are entirely unrelated
to the continuing operations of the cash-generating unit, then the goodwill is deemed to have been disposed of and is fully impaired.
The impairment testing methodology is further described in Note 9.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods, work in process and intermediates
includes raw materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs and overheads based upon the normal capacity of production
facilities. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to
completion and selling expenses.
144 | Roche Finance Report 2019Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Receivables, including accounts receivable
Receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts, trade discounts, cash discounts,
volume rebates and similar allowances. A receivable represents a right to consideration that is unconditional and excludes contract
assets. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for expected credit losses over the term of the receivables. These estimates are
based on specific indicators, such as the ageing of customer balances, specific credit circumstances and the Group’s historical loss
rates for each category of customers, and adjusted for forward-looking macroeconomic data. Expenses for doubtful trade receivables
are recognised within marketing and distribution expenses. Trade discounts, cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances
are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of the related sales, using estimates based on existing contractual
obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience.
Receivables are written off (either partly or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Where receivables have been
written off, the Group continues to engage in enforcement activities to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries are
made, these are recognised in profit or loss.
For trade and lease receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach prescribed by IFRS 9, which requires/permits the use of
the lifetime expected loss provision from initial recognition of the receivables. The Group measures an allowance for doubtful accounts
equal to the credit losses expected over the lifetime of the trade and lease receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and time, call and current balances with banks and similar institutions. Such balances
are only reported as cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes
in their fair value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to an outflow of resources
that can be reliably estimated. In particular, restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan that has
either commenced implementation or has been announced. Provisions are recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to
arise and are discounted when the time value of money is material. A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation
will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability. Contingent
assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Fair values
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices or by the use of established valuation
techniques such as option pricing models and the discounted cash flow method if quoted prices in an active market are not available.
Financial instruments
Policy applicable from 1 January 2018. From 1 January 2018 the Group classifies its financial instruments in the following measurement
categories which are disclosed in Note 31: amortised cost; fair value through OCI; fair value through OCI – equity investments; or fair
value through profit or loss (including hedging instruments).
The classification depends on the Group’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.
The Group reclassifies debt securities and financial assets at amortised cost when and only when its business model for managing those
assets changes.
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through
profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets
carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 145Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Amortised cost. Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of
principal and interest are measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment. A gain or loss on a debt security that is subsequently
measured at amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or
impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other financial income using the effective interest rate method. Assets
at amortised cost are mainly comprised of accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and time accounts over three months.
Fair value through other comprehensive income (fair value through OCI). These are financial assets that are held for collection
of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and
interest. Those are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value are recorded in other comprehensive
income, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses which are
recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is
reclassified from equity to profit or loss. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other financial income using the
effective interest rate method. Fair value through other comprehensive income assets are mainly comprised of money market instruments
and debt securities.
Equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (fair value through OCI). These are equity investments
in private biotechnology companies, which are kept as part of the Group’s strategic alliance efforts. These assets are subsequently
measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as other financial income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a
recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and included in the fair value reserve.
When such an asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified within equity from the
fair value reserve to retained earnings and never to profit or loss.
Fair value through profit or loss. These are financial assets whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis. A gain or loss on a
financial asset that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in
profit or loss and presented within other financial income (expense) in the period in which it arises. Fair value through profit or loss assets
are mainly comprised of equity investments/securities. Contingent consideration liabilities are initially recorded and subsequently carried
at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in general and administration within the operating results of the income statement.
Fair value through profit or loss – hedging instruments. These are derivative financial instruments that are used to manage the
exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. These instruments are initially recorded and subsequently
carried at fair value. Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, all changes in fair value are
recorded as other financial income (expense).
Other financial liabilities. These are non-derivative financial liabilities. Other financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value, less
transaction costs, and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Other financial liabilities are mainly
comprised of debt and trade payables.
Debt. Debt instruments are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Subsequently they are
reported at amortised cost. Any discount between the net proceeds received and the principal value due on redemption is amortised
over the duration of the debt instrument and is recognised as part of financing costs using the effective interest rate method.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual cash flows from the asset expire or when the Group transfers the rights to receive
the contractual cash flows from the financial assets in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the
financial asset are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when the contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
Policy applicable before 1 January 2018 for financial instruments previously classified as available-for-sale. These were non-
derivative financial assets that were either designated as such or were not classified in any other financial asset category. Available-for-
sale assets were initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Changes in fair value were recorded in other comprehensive
income, except for impairments and interest and foreign exchange components. When an investment was derecognised, the cumulative
gains and losses in equity were reclassified to other financial income (expense). Available-for-sale assets were mainly comprised of
marketable securities.
146 | Roche Finance Report 2019Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Impairment of financial assets
The Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) for financial assets measured at amortised cost and debt
securities measured at fair value through OCI.
For trade and lease receivables the Group measures the allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.
For debt securities carried at fair value through OCI and debt securities and other financial assets at amortised cost, which are determined
to have low credit risk based on external credit ratings of the counterparties, the Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal
to 12-month ECL. The Group considers debt securities to have low credit risk when their credit risk rating is equivalent to the globally
understood definition of ‘investment grade’. The Group considers this to be at least Baa3 from Moody’s and BBB- from Standard & Poor’s.
When the credit risk of debt securities carried at fair value through OCI and debt securities and other financial assets at amortised
cost has increased significantly since their initial recognition, the Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.
The Group assumes that the credit risk of such instruments have increased significantly if they are more than 30 days past due.
Financial assets are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when
the Group determines that the customer does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the
amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off are still subject to enforcement activities in order to comply
with the Group’s policy for recovery of amounts due.
Hedge accounting
The Group uses derivatives to manage its exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. The instruments
used may include interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, forwards contracts and options. The Group generally limits the use of
hedge accounting to certain significant transactions. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet several strict
conditions on eligibility of hedging and hedged instruments, formal designation and documentation, as well as hedge effectiveness and
reliability of measurement. While many of these transactions can be considered as hedges in economic terms, if the required conditions
are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item
are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship, which means that any derivatives are reported at fair value, with
changes in fair value included in other financial income (expense).
Cash flow hedge. This is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a
recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss. The hedging instrument is recorded
at fair value. The effective portion of the hedge is included in other comprehensive income and any ineffective portion is reported in
other financial income (expense). If the hedging relationship is the hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment or highly
probable forecasted transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the
hedging instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying value of the non-financial
item at the date of recognition. For all other cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that
have been recorded in other comprehensive income are included in other financial income (expense) when the forecasted transaction
affects net income.
Fair value hedge. This is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or an unrecognised firm
commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could
affect profit or loss. The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item is recorded at its previous carrying value,
adjusted for any changes in fair value that are attributable to the hedged risk. Changes in the fair values are reported in other financial
income (expense).
Roche Finance Report 2019 | 147Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding taxes payable on the distribution of
retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based on income, such as property and capital taxes, are included within general and
administration expenses.
Liabilities for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally relating to
subsidiaries, are only recognised where it is probable that such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future. Where the amount of
tax liabilities is uncertain, accruals are recorded within income tax liabilities for management’s best estimate of the ultimate liability that
is expected to arise based on the specific circumstances and the Group’s historical experience.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
carrying values. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the same taxation authority and when
there is a legally enforceable right to offset them. Deferred taxes are determined based on the currently enacted tax rates applicable
in each tax jurisdiction where the Group operates.
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The original purchase cost, consideration
received for subsequent resale of these equity instruments and other movements are reported as changes in equity. These instruments
are held for the Group’s potential conversion obligations that may arise from the Group’s equity compensation plans.
Changes in accounting policies
In 2019 the Group has adopted IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, including any consequential amendments to other standards, effective 1 January 2019.
The Group has applied the cumulative catch-up method for the transition, meaning that the comparative 2018 results have not been
restated. Full details are given in Note 28.
The Group has also implemented various other minor amendments to existing standards and interpretations, including IFRIC 23
‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’, which have no material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position.
Future new and revised standards
The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of the various new and revised standards and interpretations which the Group
has not yet applied. Based on an analysis of the standards and interpretations that will be mandatory from 1 January 2020, the Group
does not anticipate that these will have a material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position.

Report of Roche Management on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate control over
financial reporting. The internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance over the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2019 based on the
criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has concluded
that the system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 31 December 2019.
The Statutory Auditor KPMG AG has audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended
31 December 2019, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA). They have
also issued a report on the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control over financial reporting. This report is set out on
pages 156 to 157.

Statutory Auditor’s Report
To the General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise
the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2019 and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement
of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements (pages 42–148) give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial
position of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for
the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and Swiss Auditing
Standards. Our responsibilities under those provisions and Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities
for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance
with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as the IESBA Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Chargebacks, other rebates and sales returns in the US pharmaceuticals business

Income tax – uncertain tax positions
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit
of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of
our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not
provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Other Information in the Annual Report
The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information in the annual report. The other information comprises all
information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial
statements of the company, the remuneration report and our auditor’s reports thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information in the annual report and we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information in the
annual report and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that
fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibility of the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in
accordance with IFRS and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss
law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and
maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal control.
— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances.
— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made.
— Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going
concern.
154 | Roche Finance Report 2019Statutory Auditor’s Report | Roche Group
— Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures,
and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation.
— Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction,
supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit.
We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and communicate to them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report
because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of
such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and the Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control
system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions
of the Board of Directors.
We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

Roche Finance Report 2019 | 155Roche Group | Independent Reasonable Assurance Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Independent Reasonable Assurance Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
To the Board of Directors of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
We were engaged by the Board of Directors to carry out a reasonable assurance engagement on the design, implementation
and operating effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting of the Roche Group as it was in place at
31 December 2019. Management of Roche Holding Ltd assessed the effectiveness of its system of internal control over
financial reporting as of 31 December 2019 based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described
in Internal Control – Integrated Framework 2013, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and Management
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as included in the
accompanying Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
An entity’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). An entity’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a material effect
on the entity’s financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our Responsibilities
Our responsibility is to examine the design, implementation and effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial
reporting and to report thereon in the form of an independent, reasonable assurance conclusion, based on the evidence
obtained. We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE)
3000 Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the International
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained, in all material respects.
The procedures selected depend on our judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the
design, implementation and effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our examination included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, testing and evaluating the design, implementation and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures, as we
considered necessary in the circumstances.
156 | Roche Finance Report 2019Independent Reasonable Assurance Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting | Roche Group
Our Independence and Quality Control
The firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality
control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards
and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants
issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity,
objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.
Conclusion
Our conclusion has been formed on the basis of, and is subject to, the matters outlined in this report.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.
In our opinion, the Roche Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
31 December 2019 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Alternative Performance Measures
The financial information included in the Financial Review includes certain Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) which are not
accounting measures as defined by IFRS, in particular the core results, net working capital, net operating assets, free cash flow and
constant exchange rates. These APMs should not be used instead of, or considered as alternatives to, the Group’s consolidated financial
results based on IFRS. These APMs may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies. All APMs
presented in the Financial Review relate to the performance of the current year and comparative periods.
Core results
Core results allow for an assessment of both the Group’s actual results as defined by IFRS and the underlying performance of
the business. The core results concept, which is used in the internal management of the business, is based on the IFRS results,
with the following adjustments:
• Global restructuring plans (see Note 7) are excluded.
• Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (see Note 10) and impairment of goodwill (see Note 9) are excluded.
• Acquisition accounting and other impacts from the accounting for merger and acquisition transactions and alliance arrangements
(see Financial Review) are excluded.
• Discontinued operations (currently none) are excluded.
• Legal and environmental cases (see Financial Review) are excluded.
• Global issues outside the healthcare sector beyond the Group’s control are excluded.
• Material treasury items such as major debt restructurings (currently none) are excluded.
• Pension plan settlements (see Note 26) are excluded.
• The tax benefit recorded under IFRS in respect of Equity Compensation Plans (ECPs), which varies according to the price of the
underlying equity, is replaced by a normalised tax benefit, being the IFRS 2 expense multiplied by the applicable tax rate (see Note 5).
The core results concept was further described on 22 October 2010 at an Investor Update teleconference, which is available for
download at: http://www.roche.com/investors/ir_agenda/csr_151010.htm
The Group’s IFRS results, including the divisional breakdown, are reconciled to the core results in the tables below. The calculation
of Core EPS is also given in the tables below. Additional commentary to the adjustment items is given in the Financial Review.

Free cash flow
Free cash flow is used to assess the Group’s ability to generate the cash required to conduct and maintain its operations. It also
indicates the Group’s ability to generate cash to finance dividend payments, repay debt and to undertake merger and acquisition
activities. The free cash flow concept is used in the internal management of the business.
Operating free cash flow is calculated based on the IFRS operating profit and adjusted for certain cash items, movements in net working
capital and capital expenditures (investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as well as the principal portion of
lease liabilities paid for leased assets). Operating free cash flow is different from cash flows from operating activities as defined by IAS 7
in that it includes capital expenditures (which is within the responsibility of divisional management) and excludes income taxes paid
(which is not within the responsibility of divisional management). Cash outflows from defined benefit plans are allocated to the operating
free cash flow based on the current service cost with the residual allocated to treasury activities.
Free cash flow is calculated as the operating free cash flow adjusted for treasury activities and taxes paid. Free cash flow is different
from total cash flows as defined by IAS 7 in that it excludes dividend payments, cash inflows/outflows from financing activities such
as issuance/repayment of debt, purchase/sale of marketable securities and cash inflows/outflows from mergers, acquisitions and
divestments.
Effective 1 January 2019 the Group has implemented IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ and the comparative 2018 results have not been restated. The main
impact of the new standard is to bring operating leases onto the balance sheet. The application of the new standard does not materially
impact operating free cash flow, as repayment of the principal portion of the lease liabilities paid in the 2019 presentation almost entirely
matches the operating lease expenses that were included in operating profit in the 2018 presentation.

Operating free cash flow and free cash flow are calculated as shown in the tables below. Additional commentary to the adjustment items
is given in the Financial Review.

EBITDA
The Group does not use Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) in either its internal management
reporting or its external communications. In the opinion of the Group’s management, operating free cash flow gives a more useful and
consistent measurement of ‘cash earnings’ than EBITDA, which includes many non-cash items such as provisions, allowances for trade
receivables and inventories, and certain non-cash entries arising from acquisition accounting and pension accounting. Operating free
cash flow also includes the cash used for investments in property, plant and equipment, leased assets and intangible assets, whereas
EBITDA excludes all costs and cash outflows for these items.
166 | Roche Finance Report 2019Multi-Year Overview and Supplementary Information | Roche Group
For the convenience of those readers who do use EBITDA, this is provided in the table below. As the starting point this uses the core
results, which already exclude the amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
For the EBITDA information, the main impact of the implementation of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ is to exclude depreciation and impairment of right-
of-use assets for leases where the Group is the lessee, which were previously reported as operating leases, effective 1 January 2019.
As a result the Group’s EBITDA increased by approximately CHF 0.4 billion during 2019 as the costs and cash outflows for leased assets
are now completely excluded from EBITDA.

Net operating assets
Net operating assets allow for an assessment of the Group’s operating performance of the business independently from financing
and tax activities. Net operating assets are calculated as property, plant and equipment, leased assets (‘right-of-use assets’), goodwill,
intangible assets, net working capital and long-term net operating assets minus provisions.
The main impact of the implementation of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ is to include right-of-use assets for leases where the Group is the lessee
and which were previously reported as operating leases, as part of segment operating assets, effective 1 January 2019. Details of all
the additional assets and liabilities reported effective 1 January 2019 are provided in Note 28 with a divisional split in Note 2.
The calculation of the net operating assets disclosed in Note 2 of the Annual Financial Statements is shown in the tables below.

Net debt
Net debt is used to monitor the Group’s overall short- and long-term liquidity. Net debt is calculated as the sum of total debt (long-term
and short-term) less marketable securities, cash and cash equivalents. Net debt is unaffected by the implementation of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
as the Group’s definition of net debt does not include lease liabilities.
Net debt calculations, including details of movements during the current year, are shown in the table on page 34 in the Financial Review.
Net working capital
Net working capital is used to assess the Group’s efficiency in utilising assets and short-term liquidity. Net trade working capital is
calculated as trade receivables and inventories minus trade payables. Net working capital is calculated as net trade working capital
adjusted for other receivables and other payables.
Net working capital and net trade working capital calculations are shown in the tables on page 21 (Pharmaceuticals Division), page 27
(Diagnostics Division) and page 29 (Corporate) in the Financial Review.
Constant exchange rates
Certain percentage changes in the Financial Review have been calculated using constant exchange rates (CER) which allow for an
assessment of the Group’s financial performance with the effects of exchange rate fluctuations eliminated. The percentage changes
at constant exchange rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the current reported period and the prior period
numbers at constant currency exchange rates, equalling the average exchange rates for the prior year. For example, a CER change
between a 2019 line item and its 2018 equivalent is calculated using the average exchange rate for the year ended 31 December 2018
for both the 2019 line item and the 2018 line item and subsequently calculating the change in percent with respect to the two
recalculated numbers.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are excluded from the calculation of CER growth rates in the earnings per share disclosures.
In countries where there is a significant devaluation in the local currency in the current year, the simulations use the average exchange
rate of the current year instead of the prior year to avoid that CER growth rates are artificially inflated.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel (the ‘Company’) have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of
Swiss Law on Accounting and Financial Reporting (32nd title of the Swiss Code of Obligations, ‘CO’). Where not prescribed by law,
the significant accounting principles applied are described below.
The Company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with a recognised accounting standard (International
Financial Reporting Standards). In accordance with the CO, the Company decided to forgo presenting additional information on audit fees
in the notes as well as a cash flow statement.
Valuation methods and translation of foreign currencies
Marketable securities are reported at the lower of cost or market value. All other financial assets, including investments, are reported at
cost less appropriate write-downs. Own equity instruments are recognised at cost and deducted from equity at the time of purchase.
If the own equity instruments are sold, the gain or loss is recognised through the income statement. Assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange, except investments which are translated at
historical rates. Transactions during the year which are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates effective
at the relevant transaction dates. Resulting exchange gains and losses are recognised in the income statement with the exception of
unrealised gains which are deferred.
Investments
The direct and indirect investments of the Company are listed in Note 33 to the Roche Group Annual Financial Statements. This listing
excludes Chugai’s subsidiaries as well as not material companies, notably companies that are inactive, dormant or in liquidation.
Ownership interests equal voting rights.
Taxes
Direct taxes include corporate income and capital taxes.

As in the previous year, share capital amounts to CHF 160 million. The share capital consists of 160,000,000 bearer shares with a nominal
value of CHF 1.00 each. Included in equity are 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine). They are not part of the share
capital and confer no voting rights. However, each non-voting equity security confers the same rights as any of the shares to participate
in the available earnings and in any remaining proceeds from liquidation following repayment of the nominal value of the share capital and,
if any, participation certificates.

Roche Finance Report 2019 | 179Roche Holding Ltd, Basel | Statutory Auditor’s Report
Statutory Auditor’s Report
To the General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2019,
the income statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant
accounting policies.
In our opinion the financial statements (pages 171–179) for the year ended 31 December 2019 comply with Swiss law and
the company’s articles of incorporation.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those
provisions and Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
section of our report. We are independent of the entity in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements
of the Swiss audit profession and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Report on Key Audit Matters based on the circular 1/2015 of the Federal Audit Oversight Authority
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial
statements of the current period. We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report.
Responsibility of the Board of Directors for the Financial Statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of
Swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the entity’s ability to continue as
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but
to do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing
Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions
of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
180 | Roche Finance Report 2019Statutory Auditor’s Report | Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and
maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.
— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control.
— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made.
— C onclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern.
We communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit.
We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that were
of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We
describe these matters in our auditor’s report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and the Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control
system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board
of Directors.
We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the company’s articles
of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

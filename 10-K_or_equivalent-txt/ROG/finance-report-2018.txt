CER (Constant Exchange Rates): The percentage changes at constant exchange rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the 2018 and 2017 results at constant
exchange rates (the average rates for the year ended 31 December 2017). For the definition of CER see page 162.
Core results and Core EPS (earnings per share): These exclude non-core items such as global restructuring plans and amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
This allows an assessment of both the actual results and the underlying performance of the business. A full income statement for the Group and the operating results of the divisions
are shown on both an IFRS and core basis. The core concept is fully described on pages 155–158 and reconciliations between the IFRS and core results are given there.
Free cash flow is used to assess the Group’s ability to generate the cash required to conduct and maintain its operations. It also indicates the Group’s ability to generate cash
to finance dividend payments, repay debt and to undertake merger and acquisition activities. The free cash flow concept is used in the internal management of the business.

Roche in 2018
The Roche Group reported very strong overall results in 2018. Sales grew by 7% at constant exchange rates (CER). IFRS net income increased
by 24% (CER) and core earnings per share increased by 19% (CER). A major driver was the US tax reform and, excluding this, core earnings
per share grew by 8%.
Sales
Group sales increased by 7% (CER) to CHF 56.8 billion (7% growth in CHF terms).
Pharmaceuticals sales growth was 7% (CER) due to the new medicines Ocrevus, Perjeta, Tecentriq, Alecensa and Hemlibra. In oncology
there was continued growth in the HER2 franchise and Avastin. MabThera/Rituxan sales fell following biosimilar launches in Europe while
biosimilar entry in the US was delayed. Immunology sales increased, led by Actemra/RoActemra and Xolair.
Diagnostics sales showed growth of 7% (CER) with the immunodiagnostics business being the major contributor.
Operating results
Core operating profit increased by 9% (CER) to CHF 20.5 billion (8% increase in CHF terms).
Research and development expenditure grew by 6% (CER) to CHF 11.0 billion on a core basis, with focus on the oncology, neuroscience
and immunology therapeutic areas. Research and development costs represented 19.4% of Group sales.
IFRS operating results include non-core expenses (pre-tax) of CHF 5.7 billion. The major factors were CHF 3.3 billion for the impairment of
goodwill and intangible assets, notably CHF 1.8 billion relating to the InterMune acquisition.
Non-operating results
Financing costs (IFRS) decreased by 8% to CHF 0.8 billion due to the base effect of 2017 debt redemption losses.
Income tax expenses (IFRS) decreased by 3% at CER to CHF 3.3 billion. The effective core tax rate for 2018 was 19.7%, with the US tax reform
decreasing this rate by more than 7 percentage points.
Net income
IFRS net income increased by 24% at CER to CHF 10.9 billion (23% increase in CHF terms).
Core earnings per share increased by 19% at CER (+18% in CHF terms).
Cash flows
Operating free cash flow increased to CHF 18.7 billion. The underlying cash generation in both divisions led to an increase of operating free
cash flow of 5% at CER and in CHF terms.
Free cash flow increased by 11% at CER (+10% in CHF terms) to CHF 14.8 billion, driven by the higher operating free cash flow and lower
income tax payments.
Financial position
Net working capital decreased by 10% (CER), driven by lower inventories in the Pharmaceuticals Division.
Net debt decreased to CHF 5.7 billion, the free cash flow more than covered the dividends and payments for mergers and acquisitions.
Net debt as a percentage of total assets was 7.2%.
Credit ratings strong: Moody’s at Aa3 and Standard & Poor’s at AA.
Shareholder return
Dividends. A proposal will be made to increase dividends by 5% to CHF 8.70 per share. This will represent the 32nd consecutive year of dividend
growth and will result in a pay-out ratio of 48.0%, subject to AGM approval.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) was 2% representing the combined performance of share and non-voting equity security.Roche Group

In 2018 the Roche Group reported sales growth of 7% at constant exchange rates (CER) and core operating profit growth of 9%. IFRS net
income increased by 24% and Core EPS increased by 19% due to the growth of the business and the impact of the 2017 US tax reform.
The sales growth was driven by the new Pharmaceuticals medicines, which more than compensated for the growing impacts of biosimilar
competition in Europe, and by the immunodiagnostics business in the Diagnostics Division. The Group improved its operating profitability
through various productivity initiatives, while supporting the launch of new products and continuing its investments in research and
development. Operating free cash flow was CHF 18.7 billion, an increase of 5%, due to higher cash generated by the business partly offset
by higher capital expenditure.

Roche Finance Report 2018 | 3Roche Group | Financial Review
Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division were CHF 44.0 billion (2017: 41.2 billion). New products were the major growth driver, with Ocrevus,
Perjeta, Tecentriq, Alecensa and Hemlibra together contributing an additional CHF 2.9 billion (CER) of new sales. Ocrevus in particular
continued its strong performance with total sales now reaching CHF 2.4 billion due to continuing growth in the US and launches in most
major European markets in 2018. Perjeta sales were CHF 2.8 billion, an increase of 27%, with higher demand in early-stage adjuvant
settings in the US. New product sales more than compensated for the initial impacts of biosimilar entry in Europe and Japan, where sales
of MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin fell by CHF 1.3 billion (CER) during 2018. The first biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan were
anticipated to come to market in the US in mid- to end-2018. The first biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin are
now anticipated to come to market in the US in the second half of 2019. Avastin sales were 3% higher mainly due to growth in China.
Sales growth in immunology was 8%, with sales of Actemra/RoActemra, Xolair and Esbriet all increasing by over 10%. Lucentis sales grew
18% in the US with increased market share across all indications. Competitive pressure in the US led to a 36% fall in Tarceva sales.
The Diagnostics Division reported sales of CHF 12.9 billion, an increase of 7% at CER. The major growth area was Centralised and
Point of Care Solutions, which represented more than half of the division’s sales and which grew by 8%, led by the immunodiagnostics
business. Molecular Diagnostics sales increased by 5%, with growth from the cobas Liat system, blood screening and virology
businesses, while Diabetes Care sales increased by 2%.
IFRS operating profit increased by 13% in the Pharmaceuticals Division and by 115% in the Diagnostics Division, with the results of
both divisions impacted by impairments of goodwill and intangible assets in both the current year and the comparative period. The 2018
results include CHF 3.3 billion for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, with the largest items being CHF 1.8 billion relating
to the InterMune acquisition. Impairments of goodwill and intangible assets in 2017 were CHF 3.5 billion. Amortisation of intangible assets
was CHF 1.3 billion and there were CHF 0.9 billion of expenses from global restructuring plans.
The Pharmaceuticals Division’s core operating profit increased by 8% at CER, which was above the 7% sales increase. Cost of sales
increased by 10%, due to volume-driven growth in manufacturing costs and increased royalty expenses, notably for Ocrevus. Marketing
and distribution grew by 4% due to product launches including Ocrevus and Tecentriq. Research and development costs grew by 6%,
especially in the oncology, neuroscience and immunology therapeutic areas. Operating profitability benefited from various productivity
initiatives. IFRS operating profit grew ahead of the core operating profit due to lower restructuring charges and also due to lower
amortisation charges for intangible assets. Operating free cash flow grew with the underlying business partly offset by higher capital
expenditure, notably at Chugai.
In the Diagnostics Division core operating profit increased by 9% at CER, which was also above the increase in sales of 7%. Cost of
sales grew by 6% due to increased sales volumes partially offset by favourable instrument and reagent mixes. Research and development
increased by 7% due to higher spending on high/mid-volume systems in Centralised and Point of Care Solutions and development of
digital clinical decision support products. IFRS operating profit grew by more than core operating profit as a result of lower amortisation
charges for intangible assets. Operating free cash flow was 11% of sales, but decreased due to the higher net working capital.
The Group’s operating free cash flow was CHF 18.7 billion, an increase of 5% at CER, due to the high cash generation of the business,
partly offset by higher capital expenditure. The free cash flow was CHF 14.8 billion, an increase of CHF 1.4 billion, due to the higher
operating free cash flow and lower income tax payments.
Financing costs were 8% lower on an IFRS basis at CHF 0.8 billion due to the base impact of the losses on debt redemption in the prior
year. Income tax expenses were lower, with the Group’s effective core tax rate at 19.7% compared to 26.6% in 2017. This was largely due
to the impact from the US tax reform which decreased the effective core tax rate by more than 7 percentage points.
Net income increased by 24% at CER on an IFRS basis and by 20% on a core basis, driven in both cases by the operating results and
the impact of the US tax reform. Excluding the impact of the US tax reform Core EPS increased by 8%.
The results expressed in Swiss francs were negatively impacted by the appreciation of the Swiss franc against the US dollar and the
Brazilian real, partly offset by the depreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro. The net impact on the results expressed in Swiss francs
compared to constant exchange rates was negligible on sales and a 1 percentage point impact on core operating profit and on Core EPS.

Roche Finance Report 2018 | 5Roche Group | Financial Review
Mergers and acquisitions
The Group has implemented the amendments to IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ issued in October 2018. The amendments further
clarify the definition of a business. The effect of the amendments is particularly applicable for many of the acquisitions carried out by
the Roche Group, since the value in the acquired companies often consists of the rights to a single product or technology. From 2018
such transactions will be accounted for as asset acquisitions rather than as business combinations. As a result the acquisition of Ignyta
has been reassessed and accounted for as an asset acquisition in the 2018 Annual Financial Statements rather than as a business
combination as disclosed in the 2018 Interim Financial Statements. Further details are given in Note 6 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Business combinations. On 5 April 2018 the Pharmaceuticals Division acquired a 100% controlling interest in Flatiron Health, Inc.
(‘Flatiron Health’) for CHF 1.6 billion. Flatiron Health is a market leader in the curation and development of real-world evidence for cancer
research as well as oncology-specific electronic health record software.
Asset acquisitions. On 8 February 2018 the Pharmaceuticals Division acquired a 100% controlling interest in Ignyta, Inc. (‘Ignyta’)
for CHF 1.8 billion. With the acquisition, the Group obtained rights to Ignyta’s lead product candidate, entrectinib, an orally bioavailable,
CNS-active tyrosine kinase inhibitor for patients who have tumours that harbour ROS1 or NTRK fusions. The Pharmaceuticals Division
also completed the acquisitions of Tusk Therapeutics Ltd and Jecure Therapeutics, Inc. for a total cash consideration of CHF 0.2 billion.
Other transactions. On 18 June 2018 the Group entered into a merger agreement with Foundation Medicine, Inc. (‘FMI’) to acquire
the outstanding shares of FMI’s common stock not already owned by the Group at a price of USD 137.00 per share in cash. FMI has
been a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group since 2015. On 31 July 2018 the transaction closed and FMI became a 100% owned
subsidiary of the Group. The cash consideration for the purchase of all public shares, including shares issuable on FMI’s outstanding
stock incentive plans and payment of related fees and expenses, amounted to CHF 2.3 billion. These amounts have been recorded to
equity as a change in ownership interest in subsidiaries.
Further details are given in Notes 6 and 30 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Global restructuring plans
During 2018 the Group continued with the implementation of various resourcing flexibility plans in its Pharmaceuticals Division to address
various future challenges including biosimilar competition. The focus areas of the plans include biologics manufacturing, commercial
operations and product development/strategy. The Group also continued with the implementation of several major global restructuring
plans initiated in prior years, notably the strategic realignment of the Pharmaceuticals Division’s manufacturing network, and programmes
to address long-term strategy in the Diagnostics Division.

6 | Roche Finance Report 2018Financial Review | Roche Group
Diagnostics Division. Strategy plans in the Diagnostics Division incurred costs of CHF 87 million mainly for employee-related matters.
Costs of CHF 36 million are included for the divestment of subsidiary in Germany and costs related to a reorganisation in the Molecular
Diagnostics business were CHF 27 million. Spending on other plans within the division was CHF 92 million.
Site consolidation. Costs from the Pharmaceuticals Division’s strategic realignment of its manufacturing network were CHF 117 million
and mainly related to the exit from the manufacturing site at Clarecastle, Ireland. The resourcing flexibility plan in the biologics
manufacturing network incurred costs of CHF 215 million, mainly relating to asset impairment and severance costs. Integration costs
following the Ignyta acquisition were CHF 46 million.
Other global restructuring plans. Resourcing flexibility initiatives in the Pharmaceuticals Division incurred costs of CHF 146 million,
mainly employee-related. The other major item was CHF 111 million for plans for outsourcing to shared service centres and external
providers. Other plans include IT plans totalling CHF 88 million.
In 2017 total global restructuring costs were CHF 1.2 billion. Further details are given in Note 7 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Pharmaceuticals Division. There were impairment charges of CHF 2.4 billion, with the major item being net expenses of CHF 1.8 billion
relating to the goodwill and intangible assets from the InterMune acquisition in 2014.
During 2018 the Group made a comprehensive reassessment of the cash-generating units used for allocating goodwill in the
Pharmaceuticals Division, as detailed in Note 9 to the Annual Financial Statements. This reassessment was made in light of the following
factors:
• Ongoing business transformations within the Pharmaceuticals Division during 2018.
• The acquisition of Flatiron Health effective April 2018 and the transaction to fully acquire Foundation Medicine effective July 2018.
• The early adoption of the amendments to IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ that were issued in October 2018. These amendments further
clarify the definition of a business and whether a transaction represents in substance the purchase of a business or a single asset or
group of similar assets.
The Group reviewed the assets and liabilities that were acquired in 2014 from the InterMune transaction in detail including the initial
valuations, the reports made for the purposes of the acquisition accounting and subsequent integration process. The conclusion of this
review was that, apart from the intangible asset representing the acquired rights to Esbriet and the related deferred taxation liabilities,
there were no other assets or liabilities recorded on the Group’s balance sheet, no other revenue streams and no other parts of the
acquired company that had any synergistic benefits for the continued operations of the Roche Group.
In substance, as at 31 December 2018, the remaining value to the Group from the InterMune acquisition is estimated at CHF 2.4 billion.
This solely relates to the acquired rights to Esbriet and should be reported in the Group’s balance sheet as a product intangible asset
in use. Therefore the previously recorded impairment on the Esbriet product intangible asset in use was partially reversed and the asset
concerned was written up to its estimated recoverable value of CHF 2.4 billion. An income of CHF 0.3 billion was recorded for this.
The main factor leading to this was an increase in forecasted cash flows relative to the previous year’s long-term forecast due to an
improvement in sales expectations.
A full impairment of CHF 2.0 billion was recorded for the goodwill from the InterMune acquisition. There is no surplus from Esbriet
revenues to support the carrying value of the goodwill, neither are there any synergistic benefits to other products in the same
therapeutic area. Accordingly the separable recoverable value of this goodwill is estimated to be zero and it has been fully impaired.
This reassessment of the cash-generating units used for allocating goodwill in the Pharmaceuticals Division, and the resulting impairment
entries recorded, aligns historic transactions with transactions from 2018 onwards, which will use the revised IFRS 3 definition of
a business that was detailed above in the section on ‘Mergers and acquisitions’.
Other impairments in the Pharmaceuticals Division totalled CHF 0.6 billion, of which the largest were impairment charges of CHF 0.2 billion
related to the Trophos acquisition from 2015. This follows from the decision to stop the development of the compound acquired. There
was a decrease in the contingent consideration provisions, mainly due to the reversal of the remaining provision related to the Trophos
acquisition, which contributed to the income of CHF 0.1 billion.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 7Roche Group | Financial Review
Diagnostics Division. The Diagnostics Division recorded impairment charges of CHF 1.0 billion. The major part of this was in the
sequencing business with impairment charges of CHF 0.6 billion. These impairments are due to a change in the commercialisation
strategy for related products, a change in timelines for future product development and a decrease in forecasted cash flows from revised
sales assumptions. In addition, in the Centralised and Point of Care Solutions business, a full impairment of CHF 0.4 billion was recorded
against the goodwill and product intangible assets acquired as part of the Constitution Medical Investors acquisition from 2013. This was
due to a decision to change the commercialisation strategy for diagnostics instruments used in haematology testing.
In 2017 there were impairment charges of CHF 2.6 billion in the Pharmaceuticals Division. The largest item was a charge of CHF 1.7 billion
for the partial impairment of the Esbriet product intangible acquired as part of the InterMune acquisition. The Diagnostics Division
recorded impairment charges of CHF 0.9 billion. The major part of this was in the sequencing business.
Further details are given in Notes 9 and 10 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Legal and environmental cases
There were no significant developments in 2018. In 2017, based on the development of the various litigations, notably the Accutane case,
some of the provisions previously held were released, resulting in income of CHF 219 million in 2017. Further details are given in Note 20

Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc appreciated against many currencies, notably the euro and, to a lesser extent,
the Brazilian real. This was partly offset by the depreciation of the Swiss franc against the Japanese yen and the US dollar.
Overall this had a negative translation impact on total net assets. The exchange rates used are given on page 29.
In the Pharmaceuticals Division net working capital decreased by 23% at CER. This mainly arose from lower inventories due to write-
offs, lower inventory levels for certain mature products and strong sales. Long-term net operating assets increased by 7% mainly as a
result of the Ignyta and Flatiron Health acquisitions, which more than offset goodwill impairment charges. In the Diagnostics Division the
increase in net working capital of 12% at CER was driven by increases in trade receivables, due to business growth especially in China
and Japan, and an increase in inventories of instruments pending installation. Long-term net operating assets in the Diagnostics Division
decreased by 8% following impairment charges to goodwill and intangible assets.
The decrease in net debt was due to the free cash flow of CHF 14.8 billion, partly offset by the dividend payments of CHF 7.3 billion. In
addition there were payments of CHF 3.4 billion for mergers and acquisitions and payments of CHF 2.3 billion for acquiring full ownership
of Foundation Medicine. The net pension liability was 7% lower at CHF 6.1 billion due to an increase in discount rates partially offset
by changes in the fair value of plan assets. The net tax liabilities increased mainly due to the deferred tax effects from the change in net
pension liabilities.

The Group’s operating free cash flow for 2018 was CHF 18.7 billion, an increase of 5% at CER. This was due to the high cash generation
of the business, with sales growth exceeding the increases in cash expenses. This was partly offset by higher capital expenditure.
The free cash flow was CHF 14.8 billion, an increase of 11% at CER compared to 2017. This arose from the higher operating free cash flow
and lower income tax payments in 2018.

Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division were CHF 44.0 billion, an increase of 7% at CER. New product sales more than compensated for
the growing impacts of biosimilar competition for MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin in Europe.
The sales growth was driven by the continuing rollout of the new products Ocrevus, Perjeta, Tecentriq, Alecensa and Hemlibra, which
together contributed an additional CHF 2.9 billion (CER) of new sales. Ocrevus in particular continued its strong performance with
total sales now reaching CHF 2.4 billion (2017: 0.9 billion) due to continuing growth in the US and strong initial uptake in other markets,
notably in Germany. Perjeta sales were up by 27% to CHF 2.8 billion due to increased demand in early-stage adjuvant settings in the
US and continued growth in neoadjuvant and metastatic settings in Europe.
Biosimilar competition had a negative impact, with continuing erosion for MabThera/Rituxan in Europe and the first biosimilar launches of
Herceptin in Europe and MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin in Japan. Sales of these two products fell by CHF 1.3 billion (CER) in Europe
and Japan in 2018. The first biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan had been expected to come to market in the US in mid- to end-2018.
The first biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin are now anticipated to come to market in the US in the second
half of 2019. In total, MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin sales in 2018 were CHF 20.6 billion, a decrease of 2%.
Oncology remains the Division’s largest therapeutic area with total growth of 2% with the new products Perjeta, Tecentriq and Alecensa
being major contributors. Avastin sales increased by 3%, mainly due to growth in China. Herceptin sales were 1% higher, with growth
in the US offsetting the initial impact from the biosimilar competition in Europe. MabThera/Rituxan sales fell following biosimilar launches
in Europe. In Japan, the recent biosimilar launches had a limited impact on MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin sales, with the main factor
of the sales decline being government price cuts. Tecentriq (increase of 59%) and Alecensa (increase of 76%) both reported continuing
post-launch uptake. Sales of Tarceva fell by 36% due to competitive pressure in the US.
Sales in immunology grew, with Actemra/RoActemra, Xolair and Esbriet all increasing by over 10%. Lucentis sales grew 18% in the US
driven by increased market share across all indications. Infectious diseases sales were 20% lower due mainly to the patent expiry of Tamiflu
in the US and other major markets in 2016. The new influenza medicine Xofluza was launched in the US in late 2018 and initial sales
were CHF 13 million. In other therapeutic areas, sales of Activase/TNKase were 6% higher in the US. The launch and rollout of Hemlibra,
a medicine for haemophilia A, continued and sales in 2018 were CHF 224 million, mostly in the US, major EU markets and Japan.

Sales were 8% lower, driven by Europe where sales fell by 47% due to the launch of biosimilars in most EU markets. In the US, where
MabThera/Rituxan is widely used across nearly all approved indications, sales increased by 4%. There was growth in both the
immunology and oncology segments, also driven by the subcutaneous formulation. The first biosimilar launches had been expected in
the US in mid- to end-2018, but now could come to market in the second half of 2019. Sales were also higher in the International region,
particularly in China (+40%) due to broader market penetration. In Japan sales were adversely affected by government price cuts and,
to a limited extent, by the first biosimilar versions which were launched in 2018.

Sales in the HER2 franchise grew by 7% to CHF 10.7 billion of sales. Herceptin sales were 1% higher overall, driven by growth in the US
and in the International region largely offset by falls in Europe and Japan. Factors in the US growth of 9% include the rollout of the new
formulation launched in 2017 and longer duration of treatment in combination with Perjeta. In the International region, growth of 10% was
driven by China due to broader market penetration. Herceptin sales in Europe were 16% lower due to the first biosimilar launches from
mid-2018. Biosimilar launches also had an impact on Herceptin sales in Japan. Sales of Perjeta grew by 27% with increased demand in all
regions, notably in the early breast cancer adjuvant setting in the US, Europe, Japan and Brazil. Kadcyla sales increased in particular in
the International region (+22%).

There was continuously growing demand in both indications in the US in 2018, with growth driven both by new patients and by returning
patients. Ocrevus was launched in the US in April 2017 so the comparative period includes only 9 months of sales during the initial launch
phase. Elsewhere Ocrevus is showing strong initial uptake where launched, notably in Germany.

United States. Sales grew by 14% led by the continued uptake of Ocrevus, which was launched in April 2017. The HER2 franchise grew
14%, with sales increase of Perjeta in particular in the early breast cancer adjuvant setting as well as sales growth for Herceptin. Lucentis
sales increased by 18% due to the ongoing rollout of prefilled syringes, with increased market share in all approved indications. Hemlibra
and Alecensa sales showed a strong initial uptake. Sales of Tarceva fell 49% due to competitive pressure. Mandatory discounts to
hospitals under the 340B Drug Discount Program increased due to higher sales, notably for Ocrevus and oncology products.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 15Roche Group | Financial Review
Europe. Sales declined 7% due to increasing biosimilar penetration of MabThera/Rituxan in most EU markets, notably in Germany, France
and the UK. Herceptin sales declined by 16% due to biosimilar launches in major EU markets from mid-2018. This negative impact on
sales was partly offset by the launches of Ocrevus, Tecentriq, Perjeta as well as Alecensa and Gazyva/Gazyvaro, in particular in Germany.
Actemra/RoActemra sales increased due to continued uptake of the subcutaneous formulation.
Japan. Sales decreased by 1% due to the 2018 government price cuts which had an annualised negative effect on sales of approximately
5.9%. In particular, MabThera/Rituxan (–36%) and Herceptin (–16%) sales were both negatively affected. Tamiflu (–37%) sales decreased
due to lower government stockpiles. This was partially offset by higher sales of Tecentriq, which was launched in 2018, Actemra/
RoActemra (+15%) and Alecensa (+27%).
International. Sales increased by 10% driven by the Asia-Pacific and Latin America subregions. Sales in China grew due to broader
market penetration for Avastin, MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin. Sales in Brazil increased mainly due to higher sales of Perjeta,
MabThera/Rituxan and Actemra/RoActemra. In Turkey the main drivers of growth were Avastin and MabThera/Rituxan, while in Russia
sales growth was driven by higher sales across the HER2 franchise.

Competition from generic medicines and biosimilars
The Group’s pharmaceutical products are generally protected by patent rights which are intended to provide the Group with exclusive
marketing rights in various countries. However, patent rights are of varying scope and duration, and the Group may be required to enter
into costly litigation to enforce its patent and other intellectual property rights. Loss of market exclusivity for one or more major products
– either due to patent expiration, challenges from generic medicines, biosimilars and non-comparable biologics or other reasons –
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations or financial condition. The introduction of a generic,
biosimilar or non-comparable biologic version of the same or a similar medicine typically results in a significant reduction in net sales
for the relevant product, as other manufacturers typically offer their versions at lower prices.
Patents and their expiry are, and always have been, an integral part of the Group’s business model and future growth will remain driven
by innovation. The latest information from clinical studies is included in the Annual Report on pages 40 to 55 and details of the Group’s
Product Development Portfolio are available for download at:

Tamiflu 378 535 –29 Patent expiry in US and other major markets in 2016
The intellectual property for biologics can involve multiple patents and patent timelines for each individual product and therefore it is
more difficult to give an exact date for patent expiry for biologic medicines. The Group currently estimates that some basic, primary patents
for its major biologic medicines will begin to expire as follows:
• MabThera/Rituxan: from around mid-2018 in the US.
• Herceptin: from mid-2019 in the US.
• Avastin: from mid-2019 in the US and from around 2020 in the EU.
• Subcutaneous formulations of MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin: beyond 2025 (secondary patent rights).
16 | Roche Finance Report 2018Financial Review | Roche Group
The ‘composition of matter’ patents for MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin in the EU have expired. The first biosimilar versions of MabThera/
Rituxan were launched in Europe from mid-2017. They are now marketed in most EU countries and were the major factor in the sales
decline of this product in Europe in 2018. The first biosimilar versions of Herceptin have been launched in major EU markets from mid-2018.
In Japan, the first biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin were launched in 2018 and sales were also adversely affected
by government price cuts. In total, sales of MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin fell by CHF 1.3 billion (CER) in Europe and Japan during 2018.
The Group had anticipated the first biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan in the US in mid- to end-2018, but these could now come to
market in the second half of 2019.

MabThera/Rituxan – Japan 188 293 –36 First biosimilar launches from early 2018
Herceptin – Japan 249 295 –16 First biosimilar launches from mid-2018
Based on publicly available information from competitor companies, the Group currently anticipates the following potential developments
in 2019:
• In the US, there are still many uncertainties about when specific biosimilar versions of the Group’s biologic medicines will be approved
by the Food and Drug Administration. The first biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin could come to market in
the US in the second half of 2019.
Sales in 2018 for MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin are disclosed above in the previous sections, including regional breakdowns.
These are summarised in the table below. As noted in the previous sections, the year-on-year movements are also driven by regular price
and volume changes. Biosimilar competition is only one factor in the overall picture.

The Group derives royalty income from US Patent No. 6,331,415 (known as the Cabilly patent). This patent expired in December 2018 and
therefore, while there will be certain residual income after the expiry, the Group expects that royalty income in 2019 will be significantly
lower than in 2018. Annual royalty income in 2018 from the Cabilly patent was CHF 929 million.

Royalties and other operating income increased by 12% at CER. Royalty income was 8% higher due to a net increase in sales across
the royalty portfolio. Out-licensing income increased due to higher milestone income. There was income of CHF 87 million from the sales
of the worldwide rights for Konakion and Valcyte/Cymevene (excluding Brazil) and in Japan there was CHF 240 million of other operating
income, mainly from the sale of the rights for established products by Chugai.

Core costs increased by 10% at CER. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased by 0.5 percentage points to 21.6%. Manufacturing
cost of sales grew by 8%, ahead of the sales growth of 7%, due to volume growth and higher inventory write-offs, partially offset by a
favourable product mix. Royalty expenses were 30% higher due to increased sales for certain products, notably Ocrevus. Non-core costs
include the amortisation and impairment of intangible assets mainly related to the Esbriet product intangibles. The 2017 results included
CHF 1,664 million of impairment of these intangible assets and consequently the amortisation charges in 2018 were lower. At the end
of 2018, based on an improved future sales outlook, the previous impairment was partly reversed and CHF 274 million was written back.

Core costs increased by 4% at CER. As a percentage of sales, they decreased to 15.8% from 16.3% in the comparative period.
This relative decrease resulted from various resourcing flexibility initiatives and other transformation activities. In 2018 costs were
incurred to ensure increased patient access and for the launches of Ocrevus, Tecentriq and other products. Restructuring costs
are related to the resourcing flexibility initiatives in sales affiliates, mainly in 2017. Amortisation of intangible assets includes the
Flatiron Health marketing intangibles since April 2018.

therapeutic area remained the primary area of research and development with Tecentriq and the cancer immunotherapy portfolio being
a key driver. Neuroscience and immunology also represent significant areas of spending. In addition, the Pharmaceuticals Division
in-licensed pipeline compounds and technologies with a total value of CHF 803 million, which are capitalised as intangible assets.
The impairment charges of CHF 507 million in 2018 include an impairment of CHF 100 million due to the decision to stop the development
of the compound acquired as part of the Trophos acquisition. The other impairment charges relate to various portfolio decisions around
the development of compounds with different alliance partners.

Core costs increased by 8% at CER and, as a percentage of sales, they remained stable at 3.5%. Administration costs increased mainly
due to higher legal service costs. Business taxes and capital taxes fell due to decreased costs for the US Branded Prescription Drug Fee.
Restructuring costs in 2017 relate to site divestments. The impairment charges in 2018 relate to the full write-off of goodwill from
the InterMune and Trophos acquisitions. The mergers and acquisitions and alliance transactions expenses includes costs related to
the Flatiron Health acquisition in 2018, partially offset by the reversal of the remaining contingent consideration provisions for the
Trophos acquisition. In 2017 income of CHF 143 million arose from the release of legal provisions, notably the Accutane case.

Pharmaceuticals Division total core operating profit and operating profit both include the elimination of CHF minus 50 million of unrealised intercompany gains between
Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai (2017: CHF minus 9 million).
The increase in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen has a positive impact of approximately 1% on the Chugai results when expressed
in Swiss francs for the Group’s consolidated results. At CER (as reported in Japanese yen), sales by Chugai to external customers were
1% lower compared to 2017 driven by the 2018 government price cuts which had an annualised negative effect on sales of approximately
5.9%. Sales within the division increased by 44% due to increased sales of Actemra/RoActemra and Alecensa to Roche Pharmaceuticals.
Chugai’s core operating profit increased by 33% due to the income from the divestment of established products and the higher gross
profit from sales with Roche Pharmaceuticals. This was partially offset by increased research and development spending. Operating free
cash flow at Chugai decreased due to the capital expenditure for the new research facilities being constructed at Yokohama.

The absolute amount of the movement between the 2018 and 2017 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2018 transactions (translated at average
rates for 2017) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2018 transactions include non-cash movements and therefore the movements in
this table are not the same as the amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only includes the cash movements). A full consolidated balance sheet is given on page 43
of the Annual Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given above is on page 161.
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc depreciated significantly
against the US dollar and the Japanese yen, resulting in a positive translation impact on net operating assets which was partly offset
by the appreciation of the Swiss franc against the Brazilian real and the euro. The exchange rates used are given on page 29.
Net working capital. Net working capital decreased by 23%, mainly due to lower inventories and a higher net liability for other receivables/
payables. Trade receivables were higher as a result of higher sales and extended payment terms for Ocrevus in the US. Inventories
decreased due to higher inventory write-offs, lower inventory levels for certain mature products as well as due to strong sales. Trade
payables were lower following the settlement of year-end positions. The net liability for other receivables/payables increased due
to higher accruals for rebates and chargebacks.
Long-term net operating assets. Overall long-term net operating assets increased by 7%. Goodwill and intangible assets increased
due to the acquisitions of Ignyta and Flatiron Health, partly offset by the impairments from the InterMune and Trophos assets. The
major item in capital expenditure was Chugai’s continued development of their new research facilities in Yokohama in Japan. At Roche,
there were investments in site development at the Basel and Kaiseraugst sites in Switzerland and at the South San Francisco campus
in the US as well as manufacturing investments in Switzerland, Germany and the US.

from the underlying business, with operating profit, net of operating cash adjustments showing an increase of 8%. Net working capital
was lower due to the increase in accruals for rebates and chargebacks and lower inventories. Capital expenditure was higher due
to the land purchase in Yokohama, Japan, for Chugai’s new research facilities and the final payment of the Genentech property lease
option exercise. Investments in intangible assets were CHF 0.2 billion higher than in 2017.

The expiry in late 2017 of royalty-bearing patents in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology was the main factor behind the lower
royalty income. The 2017 results for out-licensing income included the settlement of a patent dispute in that year. The global restructuring
income related to a licensing deal from a portfolio prioritisation initiative.

Core costs increased by 6% at CER, below the sales growth of 7%. The increase was due to higher sales volumes partially offset by
favourable instruments and reagent mixes. The core cost of sales ratio decreased by 0.5 percentage points to 46.3%. Global restructuring
costs were mainly due to Diagnostics strategy plans. Amortisation expenses were lower due to the product intangible assets from
the Corange/Boehringer-Mannheim acquisition from 1997 which were fully amortised by the end of 2017. Impairment charges related
to the impairment of the intangible assets in the sequencing business and from the Constitution Medical Investors acquisition from 2013.

The increase in core costs was primarily due to higher spending in emerging markets in the Asia-Pacific and EMEA regions. Additionally,
the increase also results from marketing software and the launch of new digital solutions. On a core basis, marketing and distribution
costs as a percentage of sales decreased to 23.0% from 23.1% in 2017. Global restructuring costs consisted of organisational changes.

Core costs increased due to higher spending in the Centralised and Point of Care Solutions portfolio in high/mid-volume systems.
There was also increased spending to develop digital clinical decision support products and for the GE Healthcare collaboration.
Spending in the sequencing business was also higher. As a percentage of sales, research and development core costs increased to
11.3% from 11.2% in 2017. Impairment charges relate to intangible assets of the sequencing business.

Core costs remained stable compared to 2017, while there was a 3% increase in administration costs. The main drivers were higher
personnel costs and integration expenses of recently acquired businesses, such as Viewics and mySugr. Business taxes in 2017 included
an income from a settlement agreement for the Medical Device Excise Tax in the US. As a percentage of sales, core costs were 4.1%,
a decrease of 0.3 percentage points. The impairment charges in 2017 were for the goodwill in the sequencing business. Legal expenses
mainly arose from increasing litigation costs in the sequencing business.

The absolute amount of the movement between the 2018 and 2017 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2018 transactions (translated at average
rates for 2017) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2018 transactions include non-cash movements and therefore the movements in
this table are not the same as the amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only includes the cash movements). A full consolidated balance sheet is given on page 43
of the Annual Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given above is on page 161.
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc appreciated against
the euro, resulting in a negative translation impact on net operating assets. This was partly offset by the depreciation of the Swiss franc
against the US dollar. The Diagnostics Division does not have a significant net asset position in Japanese yen and so the depreciation
of the Swiss franc against the Japanese yen had only a minor impact. The exchange rates used are given on page 29.
Net working capital. Net working capital increased by 12% at CER. Trade receivables increased by 5% due to the growth in sales,
notably in China and Japan. Inventories increased by 7% following the high demand in emerging markets driving higher purchases of
instruments that are held in inventories prior to installation. Trade payables increased by 13% as a result of optimisation measures,
including extending payment terms. The decrease in net liability for other receivables/payables was due to increases in prepayments
and settlement of significant year-end accounts payable and accruals.
Long-term net operating assets. Overall long-term net operating assets decreased by 8% at CER, mainly triggered by the 15%
decrease in goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the impairment charges. There was an increase of provisions for restructuring
and litigation cases. Capital expenditure related to instrument placements and manufacturing site developments in China and Germany.

The operating free cash flow of the Diagnostics Division was a net cash inflow of CHF 1,416 million, a decrease of 8% at CER compared
to 2017. The cash generation of the business, measured by the operating profit, net of operating cash adjustments, increased by 14%
compared with the core operating profit growth of 9%. This difference was in part due to higher cash proceeds from disposals and
higher non-cash depreciation expenses in 2018. Net working capital increased and absorbed CHF 511 million of cash in 2018, which
is due to the increases in trade receivables and inventories mentioned above in the ‘Financial position’ comments. Capital expenditure
of CHF 1.4 billion was mainly due to instrument placements, notably in China and the US, and the manufacturing site development in
China and Germany.

General and administration costs decreased by 4% at CER on a core basis due to lower project costs. Total costs on IFRS basis have
increased by 16% due to restructuring in procurement, IT and several corporate functions. The change in net operating assets was mainly
driven by organisational changes in IT resulting in a transfer of CHF 145 million of assets, mainly property, plant and equipment, from
the Pharmaceuticals Division at the beginning of 2018. Net working capital was lower due to increased notes and accounts payable from
the above-mentioned IT transfer. Corporate operating free cash flow includes restructuring activities and capital expenditure.

The results expressed in Swiss francs were negatively impacted by the appreciation of the Swiss franc against the US dollar and the
Brazilian real, partly offset by the depreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro. The net impact on the results expressed in Swiss francs
compared to constant exchange rates was negligible on sales and a 1 percentage point impact on core operating profit and on Core EPS.
The sensitivity of Group sales and core operating profit to a 1% change in average foreign currency exchange rates against the Swiss franc
during 2018 is shown in the table below.

The Group’s revenues are primarily generated from sales of products to customers. Such revenues are mainly received in the local
currency of the customer’s home market, although in certain emerging markets invoicing is made in major international currencies such
as the US dollar and euro. The costs of sales and marketing and also some administration costs follow the same currency pattern as
sales. The majority of research and development activities are incurred at the Group’s global research facilities, and therefore the costs
are mainly concentrated in US dollars, Swiss francs and euros. General and administration costs tend to be incurred mainly at central
locations in the US, Switzerland and Germany. Chugai’s revenues and costs are denominated in Japanese yen.

Financing costs
Core financing costs were CHF 744 million, a decrease of 9% at CER compared to 2017, with the decrease being mainly due to the base
effect of losses on debt redemption of CHF 74 million in 2017. Interest expenses (including amortisation of debt discounts and issue
costs) increased by 2% at CER to CHF 605 million due to increasing US interest rates. The net interest cost of defined benefit pension
plans decreased by 7% at CER to CHF 139 million due to lower discount rates in the US at the end of 2017. A full analysis of financing
costs is given in Note 4 to the Annual Financial Statements and details of the debt repayments and redemptions are given in Note 21.
30 | Roche Finance Report 2018Financial Review | Roche Group
Other financial income (expense)
Core other financial income (expense) was a net income of CHF 149 million compared to a net income of CHF 75 million in 2017.
Net income from equity investments was CHF 311 million, with higher gains on equity investments in 2018. The net foreign exchange results,
which reflect hedging costs and losses on unhedged positions, were losses of CHF 160 million compared to net losses of CHF 115 million
in 2017. A full analysis of other financial income (expense) is given in Note 4 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Income taxes
The Group’s effective core tax rate decreased by 6.9 percentage points to 19.7% in 2018. This was largely due to the impact from
the US tax reform which reduced the effective core tax rate by more than 7 percentage points.
The IFRS results show a decrease in the effective tax rate of 4.7 percentage points to 23.2%. The US tax reform had a transitional impact
on the 2017 results from the initial estimate of the effect on deferred tax balances of the tax rate changes. A true-up adjustment of
this transitional effect was included in the 2018 non-core results. The IFRS results also included the impairment of goodwill, which was
not tax deductible, hence the net effect in the ‘Goodwill and intangible assets’ line in the table below.
Further details of the Group’s income tax expenses and related balance sheet positions are given in Note 5 to the Annual Financial
Statements.

Financial position
The decrease in net debt was due to the free cash flow of CHF 14.8 billion, partly offset by the dividend payments of CHF 7.3 billion, the
payments for mergers and acquisitions of CHF 3.4 billion and the buy-out of the minority owners of Foundation Medicine of CHF 2.3 billion.
The net pension liability decreased by CHF 0.5 billion to CHF 6.1 billion due to an increase in discount rates in the US, Switzerland and
Germany, partially offset by a decrease in the fair value of plan assets in Switzerland and the US. The net tax liabilities increased mainly
due to the deferred tax effects from the net pension liabilities. At 31 December 2018 the Group held financial long-term assets with
a market value of CHF 0.7 billion, which consist mostly of holdings in biotechnology and other pharmaceuticals companies which were
acquired as part of licensing transactions or scientific collaborations.
Free cash flow
The cash outflow from treasury activities increased to CHF 0.6 billion due to higher pension contributions in 2018, partly offset by
higher proceeds from sales of equity investments. Total taxes paid decreased by 16% to CHF 3.3 billion due to lower income tax payments
in the US following the US tax reform partly offset by the timing of tax payments.

For the definition of free cash flow and a detailed breakdown see pages 158–160.
Operating free cash flow increased by 5% at CER to CHF 18.7 billion. The major factor in this increase was the growth in the underlying
cash generated from operations, which was CHF 23.5 billion, as cash revenues grew more than cash expenses. There was a smaller
decrease in net working capital compared to 2017. This was mainly due to the lower increase in accounts payable in 2018. Capital
expenditure was CHF 4.0 billion, driven by site development in Basel and South San Francisco, as well as the land purchase in Yokohama,
Japan, for new research facilities. Investments in intangible assets were CHF 0.9 billion, an increase of CHF 0.2 billion compared to 2017
coming from increased in-licensing activities in the Pharmaceuticals Division.
The net cash outflow from treasury activities increased to CHF 0.6 billion due to higher pension contributions. This was partly offset
by higher proceeds from sales of equity investments in 2018. Taxes paid were 16% lower at CHF 3.3 billion due to lower tax payments in
the US following the US tax reform, partially offset by the timing of tax payments. The free cash flow of CHF 14.8 billion was 11% higher
than in 2017, as a result of the higher operating free cash flow and lower income tax payments.

economic characteristics equivalent to US dollar-denominated bonds and notes.
The net debt position of the Group at 31 December 2018 was CHF 5.7 billion, a decrease of CHF 1.3 billion from 31 December 2017. The
decrease in 2018 was due to the strong free cash flow of CHF 14.8 billion, partly offset by the annual dividend payments of CHF 7.3 billion,
the payments for the Ignyta and Flatiron Health and other acquisitions of CHF 3.4 billion, as well as the payments of CHF 2.3 billion for
taking full ownership of Foundation Medicine.
The issuance, redemption and repurchase of bonds and notes during 2018 (see Note 21 to the Annual Financial Statements) had
an impact on liquid funds, but had no impact on the net debt position.

Debt. This consists mainly of bonds and notes and includes the principal and interest on the Group’s debt instruments. Other debt is
mainly commercial paper. The carrying values are discounted based on the interest rates inherent in the instruments.
Contingent consideration provisions. These are potential payments arising from mergers and acquisitions. The carrying values are risk-
adjusted and discounted.
Unfunded defined benefit plans. These are mainly the pension plans in the Group’s German affiliates, where the fully reserved pension
obligations are used for self-financing of the local affiliates’ operations. The carrying values are discounted. Future company contributions
to the Group’s funded plans are not shown in the above table.
Capital commitments for property, plant and equipment. These are non-cancellable commitments for the purchase and construction
mainly at the Roche sites in Basel (Switzerland) and South San Francisco (US).
Operating leases. These are the future obligations under non-cancellable lease contracts. In 2019 the Group will implement IFRS 16
‘Leases’ and at that point these obligations will be reported in the balance sheet.
Contract manufacturing commitments. These are the future minimum take-or-pay commitments to purchase inventories arising from
the Group’s major long-term agreements with external Contract Manufacturing Organisations (‘CMOs’).
Alliance collaboration commitments. These are potential upfront and milestone payments that may become due from the Group’s
in-licensing arrangements. Potential payments to alliance partners and for asset deals within the next three years are included assuming
all projects currently in development are successful. Potential payments beyond three years are only included for asset deals.
Provisions for legal and environmental matters. These are not included in the above table as the timing and amount of any cash
outflow is uncertain and contingent on the development of the matters in question.

Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate
fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. In 2018
expenses for the Group’s defined contribution plans were CHF 419 million (2017: CHF 482 million). All other plans are classified as
‘defined benefit plans’, even if the Group’s potential obligation is minor or has a relatively remote possibility of arising. Plans are usually
established as trusts which are independent of the Group and are funded by payments from the Group and by employees, but in some
cases the plan is unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources. In 2018 expenses
for the Group’s defined benefit plans were CHF 657 million (2017: CHF 658 million).

Net recognised asset (liability) (6,140) (6,620)
Overall the funding status on an IFRS basis of the Group’s funded defined benefit plans increased to 93% compared to 91% at the start
of the year. This came from the plans in the US and Switzerland, with an increase in the discount rates being partially offset by decreases
in the fair value of plan assets since the end of 2017. In addition both plan assets and defined benefit obligation of funded plans increased
by CHF 1.1 billion following a plan change in Switzerland. The funded status of the pension funds is monitored by the local pension
fund governance bodies as well as being closely reviewed at a Group level. The total cash outflow from the Group’s defined benefit plans
in 2018 was CHF 0.8 billion compared to CHF 0.5 billion in 2017. There were higher additional contributions paid into the Group’s pension
plans in the US in 2018.
The unfunded plans are mainly those in the Group’s German affiliates, where the fully reserved pension obligations are used for self-
financing of the local affiliates’ operations. The unfunded liabilities for these plans decreased during 2018 mainly due to a higher discount
rate in Germany.
Full details of the Group’s pensions and other post-employment benefits are given in Note 26 to the Annual Financial Statements.

In 2018 Roche ranked number 11 among a peer group consisting of Roche and 15 other healthcare companies1) for Total Shareholder
Return (TSR), defined as share price growth plus dividends, measured in Swiss francs at actual exchange rates. At constant exchange
rates (CER) Roche ranked number 10, with the year-end return being +1% for Roche shares and +2% for Roche non-voting equity
securities. The combined performance of share and non-voting equity security was +2% compared to a weighted average return for
the peer group of +11% in CHF terms and at CER.
In 2018 the healthcare sector outperformed world equity markets, which were characterised by increased volatility in the second half
of the year. Although the Swiss Market Index (SMI) posted losses in 2018, performance was mixed relative to other major global indices,
with the SMI underperforming major US indices but outperforming European indices. The Roche share performance continued to be
impacted by uncertainty over the impact of biosimilars in the US and concerns around US pricing reforms, despite the positive news flow
over the year and a strong late-stage pipeline.

Proposed dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing an increase of 5% in the dividend for 2018 to CHF 8.70 per share and non-voting equity security
(2017: CHF 8.30) for approval at the Annual General Meeting. This would be the 32nd consecutive increase in the dividend. If the dividend
proposal is approved by shareholders, dividend payments on the total shares and non-voting equity securities will amount to CHF 7.5 billion
(2017: CHF 7.2 billion), resulting in a pay-out ratio (based on core net income) of 48.0% (2017: 54.1%). Based on the prices at year-end
2018, the dividend yield on the Roche share was 3.6% (2017: 3.4%) and the yield on the non-voting equity security was also 3.6%
(2017: 3.4%). Further information on the Roche securities is given on pages 163 to 164.

The Group plans to meet its debt obligations using existing liquid funds as well as cash generated from business operations. In 2018
the free cash flow was CHF 14.8 billion, which included the cash generated from operations, as well as payment of interest and tax.
For short-term financing requirements, the Group has a commercial paper program in the US under which it can issue up to USD 7.5 billion
of unsecured commercial paper notes and has committed credit lines of USD 7.5 billion available as back-stop lines. Commercial paper
notes totalling USD 0.6 billion were outstanding as of 31 December 2018 (2017: USD 0.8 billion). For longer-term financing the Group
maintains strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA by Standard & Poor’s and Aa3 by Moody’s which should facilitate
efficient access to international capital markets.
Further information on the Group’s debt is given in Note 21 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 37Roche Group | Financial Review
Financial risks
At 31 December 2018 the Group has a net debt position of CHF 5.7 billion (2017: CHF 7.0 billion). The financial assets of the Group
are managed in a conservative way with the objective to meet the Group’s financial obligations at all times.
Asset allocation. A considerable portion of the cash and marketable securities the Group currently holds is being used for debt
redemptions. Liquid funds are either held as cash or are invested in high-quality, investment-grade fixed income securities with
an investment horizon to meet those liquidity requirements.
Cash and marketable securities
2018 2017
(CHF m) (% of total) (CHF m) (% of total)
Cash and cash equivalents 6,681 51 4,719 39
Money market instruments 5,381 41 6,107 51
Debt securities 1,047 8 1,161 10
Equity securities 9 0 10 0
Total cash and marketable securities 13,118 100 11,997 100
Credit risk. Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations causing financial
losses for the Group. The rating profile of the Group’s CHF 13.1 billion of cash and fixed income marketable securities remained strong
with 93% being invested in the A-AAA range. The Group has signed netting and collateral agreements with the counterparties in order
to mitigate counterparty risk on derivative positions.
The Group has trade receivables of CHF 10.7 billion. Since the beginning of 2010 there have been financial difficulties in Southern
European countries, notably Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. The Group is a leading supplier to the healthcare sectors in these
countries and at 31 December 2018 has trade receivables of EUR 0.5 billion (CHF 0.5 billion) with public customers in these countries.
This is a decrease of 11% compared to 31 December 2017 in euro terms. The Group uses different measures to improve collections
in these countries, including intense communication with customers, factoring, negotiations of payment plans, charging of interest
for late payments, and legal actions. Since 2011 the Group’s trade receivables balance in Southern Europe has decreased by 64%
in euro terms.
Liquidity risk. Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time.
The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements at any
point in time. In addition to the current liquidity position, the Group has strong cash generation ability. Those future cash flows will
be used to repay debt instruments in the coming years.
Roche enjoys strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA by Standard & Poor’s and Aa3 by Moody’s. At the same time Roche
is rated at the highest available short-term ratings by those agencies. On 8 February 2018 Moody’s upgraded Roche’s rating from A1
to Aa3. In the event of financing requirements, the ratings and the strong credit of Roche should permit efficient access to international
capital markets, including the commercial paper market. The Group has committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling
USD 7.5 billion available as back-stop lines for the commercial paper program. As at 31 December 2018 no debt has been drawn under
these credit lines.
Market risk. Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities. The exposures are
predominantly related to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to assess
the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. VaR data indicates the value range within which a given financial instrument will
fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices. The Group’s VaR remained stable during 2018.
Interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could affect the Group’s financial result or the value
of the Group equity. The Group may use interest rate derivatives to manage its interest rate-related exposure and financial result.
Further information on financial risk management and financial risks and the VaR methodology is included in Note 30 to the Annual
Financial Statements.

International Financial Reporting Standards
The Roche Group has been using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to report its consolidated results since 1990.
In 2018 the Group implemented IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ and IFRS 15 ‘Revenues from Contracts with Customers’, including
any consequential amendments to other standards. The Group has also implemented various minor amendments to existing standards
and interpretations, which have no material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position.
New and revised standards applied in 2018
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’. The Group has implemented the new standard effective 1 January 2018 and has applied the exemption
from full retrospective application for the classification and measurement requirements, including impairment, meaning that the
comparative 2017 results have not been restated. The standard deals with the classification, recognition and measurement (including
impairment) of financial instruments, the impairment of financial assets, including trade and lease receivables, and also introduces
a new hedge accounting model.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenues from Contracts with Customers’. The Group has implemented the new standard effective 1 January 2018 and
has applied the full retrospective method for the transition. Since the new standard does not change the amounts of revenue recognised
for 2017, no restatements of the comparative 2017 results were necessary. The new standard contains a new set of principles on when
and how to recognise and measure revenue as well as new requirements related to presentation. The core principle in that framework is
that revenue should be recognised dependent on the transfer of promised goods or services to the customer for an amount that reflects
the consideration which should be received in exchange for those goods or services.
IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’. In October 2018 the International Accounting Standards Board issued amendments to IFRS 3
‘Business Combinations’. The amendments further clarify the definition of a business and add a ‘concentration test’ to aid the assessment
of whether a transaction represents a business combination or simply in substance the purchase of a single asset or group of similar
assets. These amendments are mandatory from 2020 and may be early adopted. The effect of the amendments is particularly applicable
for many of the acquisitions carried out by the Roche Group, since the value in the acquired companies often consists of the rights
to a single product or technology. Therefore, effective 1 January 2018, the Group has early implemented these amendments, with
prospective application and with no restatement of comparative period information. The reassessment of the cash-generating units used
for allocating goodwill in the Pharmaceuticals Division that was detailed above in the section on ‘Impairment of goodwill and intangible
assets’, and the resulting impairment entries recorded, aligns historic transactions with transactions from 2018 onwards, which will use
the revised IFRS 3 definition of a business.
As a result of the amendments to IFRS 3, the acquisition of Ignyta has been reassessed and accounted for as an asset acquisition in the
2018 Annual Financial Statements rather than as a business combination as disclosed in the 2018 Interim Financial Statements. This led
to a decrease in goodwill of CHF 0.3 billion, a decrease in intangible assets of CHF 0.1 billion and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities of
CHF 0.4 billion. Apart from this, none of these new standards have a material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position.
As a result of implementing IFRS 15, the Group has also made a presentational change to the income statement to include a subtotal
‘Revenue’, and has created a new note for ‘Revenue’ as Note 3.
See Note 33 to the Annual Financial Statements for further details of these matters.
New and revised standards that will be applied in 2019 and beyond
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. The Group will implement the new standard effective 1 January 2019 and will apply the cumulative catch-up method
option for the transition, meaning that the comparative 2018 results will not be restated when the new standard is applied. The main
impact of the new standard will be to bring operating leases on-balance sheet. The Group currently anticipates that the new standard
will result in the carrying value of leased assets being increased by approximately CHF 1.2 billion, with lease liabilities increased by a similar
amount at the date of implementation. The application of the new standard will result in part of what is currently reported as operating
lease costs being recorded as interest expenses. Given the leases involved and the prevailing low interest rate environment the Group
does not currently expect this effect to be material.
See Note 33 to the Annual Financial Statements for further details.

Consolidated Financial Statements
1. General accounting principles
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements (hereafter ‘the Annual Financial Statements’) of the Roche Group have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. They have been prepared using the historical cost
convention except for items that are required to be accounted for at fair value. They were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on
28 January 2019 and are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on 5 March 2019.
These financial statements are the Annual Financial Statements of Roche Holding Ltd, a company registered in Switzerland, and its
subsidiaries (‘the Group’).
The Group’s significant accounting policies and changes in accounting policies are disclosed in Note 33.
Key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Annual Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingent amounts. Actual outcomes could differ from those
management estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical
experience and various other factors. Revisions to estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. The following
are considered to be the key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions made and are believed to be appropriate based upon
currently available information.
Revenue. The nature of the Group’s business is such that many sales transactions do not have a simple structure and may consist of
various performance obligations that are satisfied at different times. Contracts entered into in the Diagnostics Division typically include
performance obligations for instruments (including those provided under leasing arrangements), reagents and other consumables,
and services. Instruments may be sold in cash sales transactions at discounted prices. Where instruments are provided under operating
lease arrangements, some or the entire lease revenue may be variable and subject to subsequent reagents sales. Sales, net of discounts,
are based on estimates regarding the related obligations, including their stand-alone selling prices or fair values. It requires judgement
to determine when different obligations are satisfied, including whether enforceable purchase commitments for further obligations exist
and when they arise. Out-licensing agreements may be entered into with no further obligation or may include commitments to conduct
research, late-stage development, regulatory approval, co-marketing or manufacturing. These may be settled by a combination of upfront
payments, milestone payments, other licensing fees, and reimbursements for services provided. Whether to consider these commitments
as a single performance obligation or separate ones, or even being in scope of IFRS 15 ‘Revenues from Contracts with Customers’, is not
straightforward and requires some judgement. Depending on the conclusion, this may result in all revenue being calculated at inception
and either being recognised at once or spread over the term of a longer performance obligation.
Sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts and estimates of product returns, all of which
are established at the time of sale. All product sales allowances are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the
related sales. At 31 December 2018 the Group had CHF 3,785 million in provisions and accruals for expected sales returns, chargebacks
and other rebates, including Medicaid in the US and similar rebates in other countries. The provisions and accruals relating to the
US Pharmaceuticals business amounted to CHF 1,896 million, of which CHF 455 million were associated with expected sales returns.
These estimates take into consideration historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market
events and trends such as competitive pricing and new product introductions, estimated inventory levels, and the shelf life of products.
If actual future results vary, these estimates need to be adjusted, with an effect on sales and earnings in the period of the adjustment.
Business combinations. The Group initially recognises the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non-
controlling interest and the consideration transferred in a business combination. Management judgement is particularly involved in
the assessment of whether or not the net assets acquired constitute a business and in the recognition and fair value measurement of
46 | Roche Finance Report 2018Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
intellectual property, inventories, contingent liabilities and contingent consideration. In making this assessment, management considers
the underlying economic substance of the items concerned in addition to the contractual terms. Management also applies as it considers
appropriate the optional ‘concentration test’ as set out in the amendments to IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ published in October 2018
to aid the assessment of whether a transaction represents a business combination or is simply in substance the purchase of a single
asset or group of similar assets.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. At 31 December 2018 the Group had CHF 21,818 million
in property, plant and equipment (see Note 8), CHF 8,948 million in goodwill (see Note 9) and CHF 9,346 million in intangible assets
(see Note 10). Goodwill and intangible assets not yet available for use are reviewed annually for impairment. Property, plant and equipment
and intangible assets in use are assessed for impairment when there is a triggering event that provides evidence that an asset may
be impaired. To assess whether any impairment exists, estimates of expected future cash flows are used. Actual outcomes could vary
significantly from such estimates. Factors such as changes in discount rates, the planned use of buildings, machinery or equipment
or closure of facilities, the presence of competition, technical obsolescence and lower-than-anticipated product sales could lead to
shorter useful lives or impairment.
Impairment of financial assets. At 31 December 2018 the Group had CHF 540 million in allowance for doubtful accounts for trade
and lease receivables (see Note 12). The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on assumptions about risk of default and expected
loss rates. The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the calculation of the allowance for
doubtful accounts, based on the company’s past experience, existing market conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the end
of each reporting period.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits. The Group operates a number of defined benefit plans and the fair values of the
recognised plan assets and liabilities are based upon statistical and actuarial calculations. The measurement of the net defined benefit
obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate, inflation rate, expected mortality and medical cost trend rate
assumptions. At 31 December 2018 the present value of the Group’s defined benefit obligation is CHF 21,520 million (see Note 26).
The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changes in market and economic conditions, longer
or shorter lifespans of participants, and other changes in the factors being assessed. These differences could impact the defined
benefit plan assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Legal provisions. The Group provides for anticipated legal settlement costs when there is a probable outflow of resources that can
be reliably estimated. Where no reliable estimate can be made, no provision is recorded and contingent liabilities are disclosed where
material. At 31 December 2018 the Group had CHF 578 million in legal provisions. The status of significant legal cases is disclosed in
Note 20. These estimates consider the specific circumstances of each legal case, relevant legal advice and are inherently judgemental
due to the highly complex nature of legal cases. The estimates could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each
legal case progresses.
Environmental provisions. The Group provides for anticipated environmental remediation costs when there is a probable outflow
of resources that can be reasonably estimated. At 31 December 2018 the Group had CHF 491 million in environmental provisions
(see Note 20). Environmental provisions consist primarily of costs to fully clean and refurbish contaminated sites, including landfills,
and to treat and contain contamination at certain other sites. These estimates are inherently judgemental due to uncertainties related
to the detection of previously unknown contamination, the method and extent of remediation, the percentage of the problematic
materials attributable to the Group at the remediation sites, and the financial capabilities of other potentially responsible parties.
The estimates could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each environmental remediation progresses.
Contingent consideration provisions. The Group makes provision for the estimated fair value of contingent consideration arrangements
arising from business combinations. At 31 December 2018 the Group had CHF 511 million in contingent consideration provisions
(see Note 20) and the total potential payments under contingent consideration arrangements from business combinations could be
up to CHF 1,009 million (see Note 30). The estimated amounts provided are the expected payments, determined by considering
the possible scenarios of forecast sales and other performance criteria, the amount to be paid under each scenario, and the probability
of each scenario, which is then discounted to a net present value. The estimates could change substantially over time as new facts
emerge and each scenario develops.
Income taxes. At 31 December 2018 the Group had a current income tax net liability of CHF 3,600 million and a deferred tax net asset
of CHF 3,511 million (see Note 5). Significant estimates are required to determine the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Where tax positions are uncertain, accruals
are recorded within income tax liabilities for management’s best estimate of the ultimate liability that is expected to arise based on
the specific circumstances and the Group’s historical experience. Factors that may have an impact on current and deferred taxes include
changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, future levels of research and
development spending and changes in pre-tax earnings.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 47Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Leases. The treatment of leasing transactions is mainly determined by whether the lease is considered to be an operating or finance
lease. In making this assessment, management looks at the substance of the lease, as well as the legal form, and makes a judgement
about whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Arrangements which do not take the legal form
of a lease but that nevertheless convey the right to use an asset are also covered by such assessments.
Consolidation. The Group periodically undertakes transactions that may involve obtaining control or significant influence over other
companies. These transactions include equity acquisitions, asset purchases and alliance agreements. In all such cases management
makes an assessment as to whether the Group has control or significant influence over the other company, and whether it should
be consolidated as a subsidiary or accounted for as an associated company. In making this assessment, management considers the
underlying economic substance of the transaction in addition to the contractual terms.
2. Operating segment information
The Group has two divisions, Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. Revenues are primarily generated from the sale of prescription
pharmaceutical products and diagnostic instruments, reagents and consumables, respectively. Both divisions also derive revenues from
the sale or licensing of products or technology to third parties. Residual operating activities from divested businesses and certain global
activities are reported as ‘Corporate’. These include the Corporate Executive Committee and global group functions for communications,
human resources, finance (including treasury and taxes), legal, safety and environmental services. Subdivisional information is also
presented for the Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai operating segments within the Pharmaceuticals Division.

Gross-to-net sales reconciliation for the Pharmaceuticals Division
The gross-to-net sales reconciliation for the Pharmaceuticals Division is shown in the table below. The companies in the Diagnostics
Division have similar reconciling items, but at much lower amounts.

Net sales 43,967 41,220
Government and regulatory mandatory price reductions. These consist of mandatory price reductions. The major elements are
340B Drug Discount Program, Medicaid, and other plans in the US, which totalled USD 5.5 billion, equivalent to CHF 5.4 billion
(2017: USD 4.7 billion, equivalent to CHF 4.7 billion).
Contractual price reductions. These include rebates and chargebacks that are the result of contractual agreements that are primarily
volume-based and performance-based.
Cash discounts. These include credits offered to wholesalers for remitting payment on their purchases within contractually defined
incentive periods.
Customer returns reserves. These are allowances established for expected product returns.
Sales reductions that are expected to be withheld by the customer upon settlement, such as contractual price reductions and cash
discounts, are recorded in the balance sheet as a deduction from trade receivables (see Note 12). Sales reductions that are separately
payable to customers, governmental health authorities or healthcare regulatory authorities are recorded in the balance sheet as
accrued liabilities (see Note 19). Provisions for sales returns are recorded in the balance sheet as other provisions (see Note 20).

Revenue recognised in relation to performance obligations satisfied in previous years
In 2018 there was an increase in revenue recognised of CHF 30 million (2017: increase of CHF 123 million) relating to performance
obligations that were satisfied in previous periods, mainly due to adjustments of sales deduction provisions and accruals for expected
sales returns, chargebacks and other allowances in respect of previous years.
Remaining performance obligations in (partially) unsatisfied long-term contracts
Remaining performance obligations in (partially) unsatisfied long-term contracts are either included in deferred income or are related
to amounts the Group expects to receive for goods and services that have not yet been transferred to customers under existing,
non-cancellable or otherwise enforceable contracts. These are mainly associated with contracts in the Diagnostics Division that have
minimum purchase commitments related to reagents and consumables for previously sold instruments as well as monitoring and
maintenance services. For contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, the Group has elected the practical expedient
to not disclose the transaction price for remaining performance obligations at the end of each reporting period and at which point
in time the Group expects to recognise these sales.

Hyperinflationary economies
Since 1 July 2018 the Group has considered Argentina to be a hyperinflationary economy, in the context of IAS 29 ‘Financial Reporting
in Hyperinflationary Economies’. The cumulative inflation index over the last three years exceeds 100%, as measured by the National
Wholesaler Price Index (Sistema de Índices de Precios Mayoristas).
Accordingly the Group has reviewed the reporting from its affiliates in Argentina, and where necessary restated them in line with IAS 29.
The potential adjustments resulting from the application of IAS 29 do not have a significant impact on the Group’s operating results and
balance sheet. An adjustment is recorded for the gains (losses) on the net monetary position, which is a loss of CHF 18 million resulting
from the loss in purchasing power of the positive net monetary position during 2018 of the Group’s Argentinian affiliates.
5. Income taxes

Current income taxes (3,881) (4,846)
Deferred taxes 598 1,423
Total income tax (expense) (3,283) (3,423)
Since the Group operates internationally, it is subject to income taxes in many different tax jurisdictions. The Group calculates its average
expected tax rate as a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates. This rate changes from
year to year due to changes in the mix of the Group’s taxable income and changes in local tax rates.
The Group’s average expected tax rate decreased to 17.8% in 2018 (2017: 21.5%). This was largely due to a decrease in the US Federal
tax rate from 35% to 21% which was enacted in December 2017 and effective from 1 January 2018.
The Group’s effective tax rate decreased to 23.2% in 2018 (2017: 27.9%). The main driver for the decrease was the impact from the
US tax reform which lowered the average expected tax rate mentioned above. In addition the US tax reform had a transitional impact
on the 2017 results from the initial estimate of the effect on deferred tax balances of the tax rate changes which resulted in an expense
of CHF 116 million increasing the 2017 Group effective tax rate. A true-up adjustment of this transitional effect was included in 2018
and resulted in an income of CHF 35 million.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 55Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The Group’s effective tax rate can be reconciled to the Group’s average expected tax rate as follows:
Reconciliation of the Group’s effective tax rate
2018 2017
Average expected tax rate 17.8% 21.5%
Tax effect of
– Non-taxable income/non-deductible expenses +4.5% +4.8%
– Equity compensation plans +0.1% +0.2%
– Research and development tax credits and other deductions –2.0% –2.9%
– US state tax impacts +0.4% +0.5%
– Tax on unremitted earnings +1.2% +1.7%
– Transitional effect of changes in US tax rates –0.2% +0.9%
– Prior year and other differences +1.4% +1.2%
Group’s effective tax rate 23.2% 27.9%
The income tax benefit recorded in respect of equity compensation plans, which varies according to the price of the underlying equity,
was CHF 59 million (2017: CHF 87 million). Had the income tax benefits been recorded solely on the basis of the IFRS 2 expense
multiplied by the applicable tax rate, then a benefit of approximately CHF 78 million (2017: CHF 118 million) would have been recorded.

The deferred tax net assets for other temporary differences mainly relate to accrued and other liabilities, provisions and unrealised profit
in inventory.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward only to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit is probable.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses, including valuation allowances, as follows:
Unrecognised tax losses: expiry
2018 2017
Amount Applicable Amount Applicable
(CHF m) tax rate (CHF m) tax rate
Within one year 183 12% 0 –
Between one and five years 2,150 12% 2,358 12%
More than five years 10,893 5% 9,103 5%
Total unrecognised tax losses 13,226 6% 11,461 6%
The ‘More than five years’ category includes losses that cannot be used for US state income tax purposes in those states which only
permit tax reporting on a separate entity basis.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been established for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the remittance of
earnings of foreign subsidiaries, where such amounts are currently regarded as permanently reinvested for the purpose of these financial
statements. The total unremitted earnings of the Group, regarded as permanently reinvested for the purpose of these financial
statements, were CHF 33.9 billion at 31 December 2018 (2017: CHF 29.1 billion).
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 57Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
6. Mergers and acquisitions
The Group has implemented the amendments to IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ issued in October 2018. The amendments further clarify
the definition of a business. The effect of the amendments is particularly applicable for many of the acquisitions carried out by the Group,
since the value in the acquired companies often largely consists of the rights to a single product or technology. From 2018 such
transactions will be accounted for as asset acquisitions rather than business combinations.
This note has been expanded and renamed as ‘Mergers and acquisitions’ to include both transactions accounted for as business
combinations and asset acquisitions. Asset acquisitions are acquisitions of legal entities that do not qualify as business combinations under
IFRS 3. Cash consideration paid for asset acquisitions at the transaction date and subsequent additional contingent payments made upon
the achievement of performance-related development milestones are now presented in the line ‘Asset acquisitions’ as disclosed separately
below. Subsequent consideration for performance-related development milestones for transactions treated as asset acquisitions is
recognised as intangible assets when the specific milestones have been achieved. Previously intangible assets acquired in asset acquisitions
were included in the line items ‘Purchase of intangible assets’ in the statement of cash flows and ‘Additions’ in Note 10 ‘Intangible assets’.
As a result of the amendments to IFRS 3 (see Note 33) the acquisition of Ignyta, Inc. has been reassessed and accounted for as an
asset acquisition in these Annual Financial Statements rather than as a business combination as disclosed in the 2018 Interim Financial
Statements. This led to a decrease in goodwill of CHF 267 million, a decrease in intangible assets of CHF 103 million and a decrease in
deferred tax liabilities of CHF 370 million.
Business combinations – 2018
Flatiron Health, Inc. On 5 April 2018 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Flatiron Health, Inc. (‘Flatiron Health’), a privately
owned US company based in New York City. Flatiron Health is a market leader in the curation and development of real-world evidence
for cancer research as well as in oncology-specific electronic health record software. Flatiron Health is reported in the Pharmaceuticals
Division. The total consideration was USD 1,616 million, which was paid in cash.
The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table below.

The fair value of Flatiron Health’s technology platform was determined using an excess earning method that is based on management
forecasts and observable market data for discount rates, tax rates and foreign exchange rates. The present value was calculated using
a risk-adjusted discount rate of 10.4% for Flatiron Health. The valuation was performed by an independent valuer.
The Flatiron Health accounts receivable is comprised of gross contractual amounts due of CHF 30 million which were all expected
to be collectable at the date of the acquisition.
Goodwill represents the value of accelerating progress towards data-driven personalised healthcare in cancer and to advance the use
of real-world evidence to set new industry standards for oncology research and development. It also represents a control premium,
the acquired work force and expected synergies. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
58 | Roche Finance Report 2018Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
The Group recognised a financial gain of CHF 78 million for fair valuing the 12% interest in Flatiron Health held by the Group prior to
the transaction. This gain is included in the statement of changes in equity within the line item ‘Net change in fair value – financial assets
at fair value through OCI’ in 2018 and has been transferred to ‘Retained earnings’ upon obtaining control.
Directly attributable transaction costs of CHF 3 million were reported in the Pharmaceuticals operating segment within general and
administration expenses.
In the nine months to 31 December 2018 Flatiron Health contributed revenue of CHF 56 million and a net loss (after tax) of CHF 175 million
to the results reported for the Pharmaceuticals Division and the Group. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2018 management
estimates that Flatiron Health would have contributed revenue of CHF 78 million and a net loss (after tax) of CHF 187 million in 2018. This
information is provided for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would
have occurred had Flatiron Health actually been acquired at the beginning of the year, or indicative of the future results of the combined
Group.
Business combinations – 2017
mySugr GmbH. On 29 June 2017 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in mySugr GmbH (‘mySugr’), a private company based
in Vienna, Austria. mySugr is reported in the Diagnostics operating segment as part of the Diabetes Care business. The total cash
consideration was EUR 64 million.
Viewics, Inc. On 27 November 2017 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Viewics, Inc. (‘Viewics’), a privately owned
US company based in San Jose, California. Viewics is reported in the Diagnostics operating segment. The total consideration was
USD 81 million, of which USD 62 million was paid in cash, USD 9 million was deferred consideration which is being paid over the period
from the date of control to 2021 and USD 10 million arose from a contingent consideration arrangement. The contingent payments
are based on the achievement of performance-related milestones and the range of undiscounted outcomes is between zero and
USD 10 million.
The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table below.

The fair value of the product intangible asset for mySugr is determined using a replacement cost method. The fair value of the other
intangible assets is determined using an excess earning method that is based on management forecasts and observable market data
for discount rates, tax rates and foreign exchange rates. The present value is calculated using a risk-adjusted discount rate of 13.0%
for mySugr and 9.5% for Viewics. The valuations were performed by independent valuers.
Goodwill represents a control premium, the acquired work force and the synergies that can be expected from integrating the acquired
companies into the Group’s existing business. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The Group recognised a financial gain of CHF 7 million and CHF 2 million respectively for fair valuing the 12% interest in mySugr and
the 10% interest in Viewics held by the Group prior to the transaction. This gain is included in other financial income (expense) for 2017.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 59Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Directly attributable transaction costs of CHF 2 million were reported in the Diagnostics operating segment within general and
administration expenses.
The impact of the mySugr and Viewics acquisitions on the 2017 results for the Diagnostics Division and the Group were not material.

Asset acquisitions – 2018
Ignyta, Inc. On 8 February 2018 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Ignyta, Inc. (‘Ignyta’), a publicly owned US company
based in San Diego, California, that had been listed on Nasdaq. With the acquisition, the Group obtained rights to Ignyta’s lead product
candidate, entrectinib, an orally bioavailable, CNS-active tyrosine kinase inhibitor for patients who have tumours that harbour ROS1 or
NTRK fusions. Ignyta is reported in the Pharmaceuticals Division. The total consideration was USD 1,949 million, which was paid in cash.
Other acquisitions. On 27 September 2018 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Tusk Therapeutics Ltd (‘Tusk’), a private
company based in Stevenage, United Kingdom. Tusk has developed an antibody with a novel mode of action aimed at depleting regulatory
T-cells which suppress immune responses, including those against cancer cells. Tusk is reported in the Pharmaceuticals Division.
On 20 November 2018 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Jecure Therapeutics, Inc. (‘Jecure’), a privately owned
US company based in San Diego, California. With the acquisition, the Group obtained rights to Jecure’s preclinical portfolio of NLRP3
inhibitors. Jecure is reported in the Pharmaceuticals Division.
The total cash consideration paid at the acquisition date for both acquisitions was CHF 150 million. Additional contingent payments may
be made based upon the achievement of performance-related milestones.

Foundation Medicine transaction
On 7 April 2015 the Group acquired a 61.3% controlling interest in Foundation Medicine, Inc. (‘FMI’), which has been treated as a fully
consolidated subsidiary of the Group since that date. The common stock of FMI was publicly traded and was listed on the Nasdaq under
the stock code ‘FMI’. At 31 December 2017 the Group’s interest in FMI was 57.5%.
On 18 June 2018 the Group entered into a merger agreement with FMI to acquire the outstanding shares of FMI’s common stock not
already owned by the Group at a price of USD 137.00 per share in cash. The merger agreement was approved by the Board of Roche and
a special committee of the independent directors of FMI and by its full board of directors. A tender offer was launched on 2 July 2018.
On 31 July 2018 the transaction closed and FMI became a 100% owned subsidiary of the Group. It has been accounted for in full as an
equity transaction. The cash consideration for the purchase of all public shares, including shares issuable on FMI’s outstanding stock
incentive plans and payment of related fees and expenses, amounted to USD 2.3 billion, as set out in the table below. These amounts
have been recorded to equity as a change in ownership interest in subsidiaries.

Genentech property purchase option exercise in 2015
In 2004 Genentech entered into a Master Lease Agreement (‘MLA’) with Slough SSF LLC (‘Slough’), which was subsequently acquired
by Health Care Properties, for the lease of property adjacent to Genentech’s South San Francisco site, which was to be developed by
Slough. The development included a total of eight buildings and construction was completed during 2008, at which time Genentech fully
occupied the property. The property lease was until 2020 with extension options to 2030. On 1 November 2015 Genentech exercised
a purchase option contained in the MLA to acquire the eight buildings and land. At 31 December 2015 the Group recorded an addition
to ‘land’ and ‘buildings and land improvements’ and corresponding liabilities for the cash outflows in 2016 and 2018. The Group also
reclassified the finance lease accounting balances that previously applied to these buildings. In November 2016 the first closing payment
of USD 311 million was made. The final closing payment of USD 269 million was made in June 2018 (see Note 19).
Leasing arrangements where the Group is the lessee
Finance leases. At 31 December 2018 the capitalised cost of property, plant and equipment under finance leases was CHF 12 million
(2017: CHF 11 million) and the net book value of these assets was CHF 5 million (2017: CHF 5 million). The carrying value of the leasing
obligation was CHF 4 million (2017: CHF 5 million), which is reported as part of Debt (see Note 21).

Cash-generating units used for allocating goodwill
Pharmaceuticals Division. During 2018 the Group made a comprehensive reassessment of the cash-generating units used for allocating
goodwill in the Pharmaceuticals Division. This reassessment was made in light of the following factors:
• Ongoing business transformations within the Pharmaceuticals Division during 2018.
• The acquisition of Flatiron Health effective April 2018 and the transaction to fully acquire Foundation Medicine effective July 2018.
• The early adoption of the amendments to IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ that were issued in October 2018. These amendments further
clarify the definition of a business and whether a transaction represents in substance the purchase of a business or a single asset
or group of similar assets.
68 | Roche Finance Report 2018Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
The conclusions of this reassessment were as follows:
• Within the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment, goodwill arises from three broad types of transactions:
ɶ – Strategic transactions that have a transformative effect across the whole division.
ɶ – Technology transactions, where the acquired technologies can have a range of areas of applications.
ɶ – Product transactions, where the acquired products typically have more limited synergistic benefits outside of the immediate product
therapeutic area.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from strategic transactions will be the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from technology transactions will also be the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating
segment. However, if the acquired technologies permanently cease to operate then this will be treated as a disposal of the business;
in such cases the goodwill will be deemed to have been disposed of and will be fully impaired.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from product transactions will be the smallest identifiable group of assets related
to the revenues and related costs that arise from the development and commercialisation of the product(s) in question. Where there
are synergistic benefits to other products in the same therapeutic area, then the revenues, costs and corresponding assets of these
other products will also be taken into account. If the acquired products permanently cease to generate economic benefits then this will
be treated as a disposal of the business; in such cases the goodwill will be deemed to have been disposed of and will be fully impaired.
• Chugai remains as a separate operating segment in the Group’s financial reporting and remains a separate cash-generating unit to
which goodwill is allocated.
Based on the above reassessment the Group allocated the remaining goodwill in the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment as listed
below. The basis for the reallocation were the historical amounts of goodwill that arose from the individual transactions.
• Strategic transactions consist of Genentech (1990/1999), Foundation Medicine (2015) and Flatiron Health (2018).
• Technology transactions consist of Therapeutic Human Polyclonals (2007), Dutalys (2014) and Santaris (2014).
• Product transactions consist of GlycArt (2005), Tanox (2007), InterMune (2014) and Trophos (2015).
Diagnostics Division. The division’s business areas and the sequencing business are the cash-generating units used for the testing of
goodwill. The goodwill arising from the Corange/Boehringer Mannheim acquisition and part of the goodwill from the Ventana acquisition
is recorded and monitored at a divisional level as it relates to the strategic development of the whole division and cannot be meaningfully
allocated to the division’s business areas. Therefore the cash-generating unit for this goodwill is the entire division. The goodwill arising
from the Viewics acquisition is monitored at the divisional level. The recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is based on value
in use.
Impairment charge – 2018
Pharmaceuticals Division. The assessment for the potential impairment of goodwill in the Pharmaceuticals Division was carried
out using the cash generating units as set out above. During 2018 impairment charges totalling CHF 2,147 million were recorded in
the Pharmaceuticals Division.
InterMune acquisition. A charge of CHF 2,040 million was recorded for the full write-off of goodwill from the InterMune acquisition
made in 2014. The main product acquired in the original transaction was InterMune’s medicine for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Esbriet.
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive disease, which causes scarring of the lungs and has a survival rate of two to three years
from diagnosis.
During 2017 the Group recorded an impairment charge of CHF 1,664 million for the partial impairment of the Esbriet product intangible
in use. The main factor leading to this was a decrease in forecasted cash flows relative to the previous year’s long-term forecast due
to a reduction in sales expectations. During 2018 the Group reviewed the assets and liabilities that were acquired in 2014 from the
InterMune transaction in detail including the initial valuations, the reports made for the purposes of the acquisition accounting and
subsequent integration process. The conclusion of this review was that, apart from the intangible asset representing the acquired rights
to Esbriet and the related deferred taxation liabilities, there were no other assets or liabilities recorded on the Group’s balance sheet,
no other revenue streams and no other parts of the acquired company that had any synergistic benefits for the continued operations
of the Roche Group.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 69Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
During 2018 the Group made the required assessment for the potential impairment of goodwill that arose from the InterMune acquisition
using as the cash-generating unit the identifiable group of assets related to the revenues and related costs that arose from the development
and commercialisation of Esbriet. As part of the Group’s regular process the value in use of the intangible asset representing the acquired
rights to Esbriet was first tested for impairment (see Note 10). As a second step the goodwill from the InterMune acquisition was then
tested for impairment. The conclusion of these impairment tests were:
• In substance the remaining value to the Group from the InterMune acquisition is estimated at CHF 2,413 million. This solely relates
to the acquired rights to Esbriet and should be reported in the Group’s balance sheet as a product intangible asset in use.
• The previously recorded impairment on the Esbriet product intangible asset in use was therefore partially reversed and an income
of CHF 274 million was recorded for this. The asset concerned was written up to its estimated recoverable value of CHF 2,413 million.
The main factor leading to this was an increase in forecasted cash flows relative to the previous year’s long-term forecast due to an
improvement in sales expectations. The intangible asset continues to be amortised over its remaining estimated useful life of three years
(see also Note 10).
• A full impairment of CHF 2,040 million was recorded for the goodwill from the InterMune acquisition. The revenues and related costs
arising from the development and commercialisation of Esbriet are fully utilised in the impairment testing process to support the
value in use of the Esbriet product intangible asset in use. There is no surplus from Esbriet revenues to support the carrying value
of the goodwill, neither are there any synergistic benefits to other products in the same therapeutic area. Accordingly the separable
recoverable value of this goodwill is estimated to be zero and it has been fully impaired.
Trophos acquisition. A charge of CHF 107 million was recorded for the full write-off of goodwill from the Trophos acquisition made
in 2015. The main product acquired in the original transaction was Trophos’ proprietary screening platform-generated olesoxime
(TRO19622), which was being developed for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare and debilitating genetic neuromuscular disease that
is most commonly diagnosed in children. During 2018 the Group decided to stop development of this compound. Therefore there are
no potential future revenues to support the carrying value of the goodwill, neither are there any synergistic benefits to other products
in the same franchise. Accordingly the intangible assets relating to this product were fully impaired (see Note 10) and the goodwill is
deemed to have been disposed of and has also been fully impaired.
Diagnostics Division. A charge of CHF 107 million was recorded in the Centralised and Point of Care business area for the full write-
off of goodwill from the CMI acquisition made in 2013. During 2018 the Group decided to change the commercialisation strategy
for diagnostic instruments used in haematology testing. This led to a full impairment of the product intangibles in use acquired as part
of the CMI acquisition (see Note 10). Therefore the goodwill is deemed to have been disposed of and has also been fully impaired.
Impairment charge – 2017
During 2017 impairment charges totalling CHF 1,058 million were recorded which related to:
• A charge of CHF 674 million in the Diagnostics Division for the full write-off of the sequencing business goodwill. The factors leading
to this impairment were: (i) a decrease in forecasted cash flows relative to the previous year’s long-term forecast due to changed
assumptions around market penetration, pricing and reimbursement; and (ii) a revised time to market of the single molecule sequencing
technology. In addition impairment charges of CHF 120 million were recorded for sequencing business product intangibles in use
acquired as part of the Ariosa acquisition (see Note 10).
• A charge of CHF 384 million in the Pharmaceuticals Division for the full write-off of the goodwill relating to the Seragon acquisition due
to the decision to stop development of the back-up compound acquired.
70 | Roche Finance Report 2018Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Value in use
Value in use is calculated using a discounted expected cash flow approach, with a post-tax discount rate applied to the projected risk-
adjusted post-tax cash flows and terminal value. The discount rate is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital as the cash-generating
units have integrated operations across large parts of the Group. It is derived from a capital asset pricing model using data from capital
markets, including government twenty-year bonds. For assessing value in use, the cash flow projections are based on the most recent
long-term forecasts approved by management. The long-term forecasts include management’s latest estimates on sales volume and
pricing, as well as production and other operating costs and assume no significant changes in the organisation. Other key assumptions
used in the calculations are the period of cash flow projections included in the long-term forecasts, the terminal value growth rate and
the discount rate.
Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations
2018 2017
Period of Terminal Period of Terminal

Pharmaceuticals Division 5 years n/a 7.5% 5 years n/a 6.8%
Diagnostics Division 5 years 1.5% 7.5% 5 years 1.5% 6.8%
For cash-generating units with a terminal value growth, the respective rate does not exceed the long-term projected growth rate for
the relevant market.
Fair value less costs of disposal
For goodwill arising from the Chugai acquisition, the fair value less costs of disposal is determined with reference to the publicly quoted
price of Chugai shares.
Sensitivity analysis
Management has performed sensitivity analyses for Roche Pharmaceuticals and the Diagnostics Division, which increased the discount
rate by 1% combined with decreasing the forecast cash flows by 5%, and for Chugai, which decreased the publicly quoted share prices
by 5%. The results of the sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the above changes in the key assumptions would not cause the carrying
values of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amounts at 31 December 2018.

Internally generated intangible assets
The Group currently has no internally generated intangible assets from development as the criteria for the recognition as an asset are
not met.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
The Group currently has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Intangible assets not available for use
These mostly represent in-process research and development assets acquired either through in-licensing arrangements, business
combinations, asset acquisitions or separate purchases. At 31 December 2018 approximately 71% (2017: 68%) of the projects in the
Pharmaceuticals Division have known decision points within the next twelve months which in certain circumstances could lead to
impairment. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the research and development processes, intangible assets not available for use are
particularly at risk of impairment if the project is not expected to result in a commercialised product.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 73Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Intangible asset impairment
Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
eventual disposal. Factors such as the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence or lower-than-anticipated sales for
products with capitalised rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
Impairment charges – 2018
Pharmaceuticals Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 233 million, net of impairment reversals, were recorded which related to:
• A charge of CHF 197 million due to the decision to stop the development of five different compounds with five different alliance
partners. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 122 million due to the decision to stop the development of a compound purchased separately. The asset concerned,
which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 100 million due to the decision to stop the development of the compound acquired as part of the Trophos acquisition.
The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 66 million for the partial impairment of a compound purchased separately due to a delayed timeline. The asset
concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was partially written down.
• A charge of CHF 13 million following a clinical data assessment. The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully
written down.
• A charge of CHF 9 million for other impairments. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully written down.
• The previously recorded impairment on the Esbriet product intangible asset in use was partially reversed and an income of CHF 274 million
was recorded for this. The asset concerned was written up to its estimated recoverable value of CHF 2,413 million. The main factor
leading to this was an increase in forecasted cash flows relative to the previous year’s long-term forecast due to an improvement in
sales expectations. The intangible asset continues to be amortised over its remaining estimated useful life of three years. Goodwill
impairment charges related to the InterMune acquisition are discussed in Note 9.
Diagnostics Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 849 million were recorded which related to:
• A charge of CHF 400 million for the full impairment of intangibles both in use and not available for use related to the sequencing
business mainly acquired as part of the Genia, CAPP and Signature acquisitions. The factors leading to this impairment were a change
in the commercialisation strategy for related products and a change in timelines for future product development. The assets concerned,
which were partly being amortised and partly not yet being amortised, were fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 206 million for the partial impairment of sequencing business product intangibles in use acquired as part of the
Ariosa acquisition. The factor leading to this impairment was a decrease in forecasted cash flows following revised sales assumptions.
The asset concerned, which was being amortised, was written down to its estimated recoverable value of CHF 89 million.
• A charge of CHF 243 million for the full impairment of Centralised and Point of Care Solutions’ product intangibles in use acquired
as part of the CMI acquisition as a result of a decision to change the commercialisation strategy for diagnostic instruments used
in haematology testing. The asset concerned, which was being amortised, was fully written down.
Impairment charges – 2017
Pharmaceuticals Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 2,188 million were recorded which related to:
• A charge of CHF 1,664 million for the partial impairment of the Esbriet product intangible in use acquired as part of the InterMune
acquisition. The asset concerned was written down to its estimated recoverable value of CHF 2,878 million. The main factor leading to
this was a decrease in forecasted cash flows relative to the previous year’s long-term forecast due to a reduction in sales expectations.
The intangible asset continues to be amortised over its remaining estimated useful life of four years.
• A charge of CHF 195 million due to the launch of a competitor product for the compound acquired as part of the Trophos acquisition.
The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was written down to its estimated recoverable value of CHF 101 million.
• A charge of CHF 149 million due to the decision to stop development of one compound with an alliance partner following an
assessment of clinical and non-clinical data. The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 74 million due to the decision to stop development of one compound acquired as part of the Dutalys acquisition.
The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 47 million due to the decision to stop development of one compound acquired as part of the Santaris acquisition
following a clinical data assessment. The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 39 million due to the decision to stop development of two compounds with two different alliance partners. The assets
concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 20 million following clinical data assessments. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully
written down.
74 | Roche Finance Report 2018Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Diagnostics Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 272 million were recorded which related to:
• A charge of CHF 152 million for the partial impairment of Molecular Diagnostics product intangibles not available for use acquired
as part of the GeneWeave acquisition. The factor leading to this partial impairment was a decrease in forecasted cash flows following
a change in the timelines for future product development, pricing and penetration rate due to updated market size assumptions.
The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was written down to its estimated recoverable value of CHF 268 million.
• A charge of CHF 120 million for the partial impairment of sequencing business product intangibles in use acquired as part of the Ariosa
acquisition. The factor leading to this impairment was a decrease in forecasted cash flows following revised assumptions on pricing
and penetration rate due to market dynamics. The asset concerned, which was being amortised, was written down to its estimated
recoverable value of CHF 312 million.
Potential commitments from alliance collaborations and purchase agreements within the next three years
The Group is party to in-licensing and similar arrangements with its alliance partners and intangible asset purchase agreements with
third parties. These arrangements and purchase agreements may require the Group to make certain milestone or other similar payments
dependent upon the achievement of agreed objectives or performance targets as defined in the collaboration and purchase agreements.
The Group’s current estimate of future third-party commitments for such payments within the next three years is set out in the table below.
These figures are undiscounted and are not risk-adjusted, meaning that they include all such potential payments that can arise assuming
all projects currently in development are successful. The timing is based on the Group’s current best estimate. These figures do not
include any potential commitments within the Group, such as may arise between the Roche and Chugai businesses.

80 | Roche Finance Report 2018Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Legal provisions
Legal provisions consist of a number of separate legal matters, including claims arising from trade, in various Group companies.
By their nature the amounts and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict.
As part of the regular review of litigation matters, management has reassessed the provisions recorded for certain litigation matters.
Based on the development of the various litigations, there was a net increase in provisions of CHF 118 million which was a major element
in the 2018 legal expenses of CHF 128 million (2017: net income of CHF 142 million). Details of the major legal cases outstanding are
disclosed below.
Environmental provisions
Provisions for environmental matters include various separate environmental issues in a number of countries. By their nature the amounts
and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict. Significant provisions are discounted by between 2% and 4% where the time value
of money is material. The significant provisions relate to the US site in Nutley, New Jersey, which was divested in September 2016,
the estimated remediation costs for a landfill site near Grenzach, Germany, that was used by manufacturing operations that were closed
some years ago and the estimated remediation costs for the manufacturing site at Clarecastle, Ireland. In 2018 the expected costs
of environmental remediation at the Clarecastle site and other matters were reassessed. Accordingly in 2018 environmental provisions
increased by CHF 30 million, net. The net environmental expenses were CHF 31 million (2017: net expense of CHF 62 million).
The Group’s procedures on environmental protection are included in the Annual Report on pages 78 to 87. These include the actions
taken by the Group with regard to climate change, notably the Group’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Restructuring provisions
These arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of business undertaken by the Group or the manner in which
business is conducted. Such provisions include only the costs necessarily entailed by the restructuring which are not associated with
the recurring activities of the Group. The timings of these cash outflows are reasonably certain. These provisions are not discounted
as the time value of money is not material in these matters.
In the Pharmaceuticals Division the significant provisions relate to the strategic realignment of the manufacturing network, the resourcing
flexibility plans to address various future challenges including biosimilar competition, the research and development strategic alignment
and the outsourcing of IT functions to shared service centres and external providers. In the Diagnostics Division the significant provisions
are associated with programmes to address long-term strategy. Further details are given in Note 7.
Contingent consideration provisions
The Group is party to certain contingent consideration arrangements arising from business combinations. Significant provisions
are discounted using an average discount rate of 3.6% (2017: 3.1%) where the time value of money is material. Additional details on
measurement, on main movements of the provisions and on the total potential payments under these arrangements are provided
in Note 30.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 81Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Other provisions
Other provisions relate to the items shown in the table below. With the exception of employee provisions, the timing of cash outflows is
by its nature uncertain.

Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees, to be affected by political, legislative, fiscal
and regulatory developments, including those relating to environmental protection, in the countries in which it operates. The industries
in which the Group operates are also subject to other risks of various kinds. The nature and frequency of these developments and events,
not all of which are covered by insurance, as well as their effect on future operations and earnings, are not predictable.
The Group has entered into strategic alliances with various companies in order to gain access to potential new products or to utilise other
companies to help develop the Group’s own potential new products. Potential future payments may become due to certain collaboration
partners achieving certain milestones as defined in the collaboration agreements. The Group’s best estimates of future commitments for
such payments are given in Note 10.
Pharmaceuticals legal cases
At 31 December 2018 provisions for legal cases in the Pharmaceuticals Division were CHF 371 million (2017: CHF 369 million). Provisions
have been recorded, and in some cases settled, mainly relating to the matters listed below.
Accutane. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (‘HLR’) and various other Roche affiliates have been named as defendants in numerous legal
actions in the US and elsewhere relating to the acne medication Accutane. The litigation alleges that Accutane caused certain serious
conditions, including, but not limited to, inflammatory bowel disease (‘IBD’), birth defects and psychiatric disorders. In 2009 HLR
announced that, following a re-evaluation of the portfolio of medicines that are now available from generic manufacturers, rapidly
declining brand sales in the US and high costs from personal-injury lawsuits that it continues to defend vigorously, it had decided
to immediately discontinue the manufacture and distribution of the product in the US.
All of the actions pending in federal court alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation (‘MDL’)
in the US District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division. In August 2015 the MDL was closed. During the pendency of
the MDL the District Court granted summary judgment in favour of HLR for all of the federal IBD cases that had proceeded and all were
affirmed by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. All of the actions pending in state court in New Jersey alleging IBD were
consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County.
In February 2015 the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County, held an eight-day evidentiary hearing on whether
plaintiffs’ experts can testify that Accutane causes Crohn’s disease. On 20 February 2015 the Superior Court barred plaintiffs’ experts
because their methods did not meet the requirements for scientific reliability. On 8 May 2015 the Superior Court entered an order
dismissing with prejudice an agreed-upon list of 2,076 Crohn’s disease cases that were subject to the Superior Court’s February 2015
order. On 28 July 2017 the New Jersey Appellate Division reversed the order excluding plaintiffs’ experts from testifying that Accutane
causes Crohn’s disease and reinstated the dismissed cases finding that the trial court wrongfully barred plaintiffs’ expert witnesses. HLR
filed a petition for review to the New Jersey Supreme Court, which was granted on 8 December 2017. On 1 August 2018 the Supreme
Court issued its decision on whether plaintiffs’ experts can testify that Accutane causes Crohn’s disease. The Supreme Court reversed
the judgment of the New Jersey Appellate Division and concluded that the trial court properly had excluded the experts thereby
dismissing 2,174 cases alleging that Accutane caused plaintiffs’ Crohn’s disease. Plaintiffs cannot further appeal. All 2,174 Crohn’s disease
cases were permanently dismissed.

On 12 May 2015 the Superior Court entered an order granting summary judgment and dismissing 18 cases filed by New Jersey residents
on the basis that the drug label was adequate as a matter of law since 2002. In July 2015 the Superior Court granted HLR’s motion for
summary judgment as to the adequacy of the label for post-2002 ingestion cases in 44 other jurisdictions. The Superior Court applied
New Jersey law to all of the jurisdictions and granted HLR’s motion dismissing approximately 511 cases. In the alternative, the Superior
Court applied the home state law and granted summary judgment in 24 jurisdictions and denied it in 20 jurisdictions; this would have
resulted in 389 cases being dismissed. On 25 July 2017 the New Jersey Appellate Division affirmed the dismissal of 197 cases and
reinstated judgments in 335 cases based on the strength of HLR’s warnings after 2002. HLR and the dismissed plaintiffs filed petitions
for review to the New Jersey Supreme Court, which was granted on 8 December 2017. On 3 October 2018 the Supreme Court issued
its decision on those cases and reversed the judgment of the New Jersey Appellate Division that had reinstated 335 cases on the basis
that the drug label was adequate as a matter of law since 2002. Plaintiffs cannot further appeal. 532 cases were permanently dismissed.
In January and October 2016 the Superior Court entered orders granting summary judgment and dismissing 191 cases for failure to prove
Accutane proximately caused their ulcerative colitis. The plaintiffs have appealed all of these decisions. During February and March 2017
the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County, held an evidentiary hearing on whether plaintiffs’ experts can testify
that Accutane causes ulcerative colitis. In April 2017 the Superior Court barred plaintiffs’ experts because their methods did not meet
the requirements for scientific reliability. In May 2017 the Superior Court entered an order dismissing 3,231 ulcerative colitis cases that
were subject to the Superior Court’s April 2017 order. The plaintiffs appealed these decisions. Oral argument is expected in 2019.
At 31 December 2018 HLR was defending no pending actions and there are approximately 3,422 cases on appeal. If any cases survive
the appeals, additional trials may be scheduled. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including many that are unique
to the particular case and therefore the trial results to date may not be predictive of future trial results. The Group continues to defend
vigorously the remaining personal injury cases and claims.
Avastin/Lucentis investigations. On 14 February 2013 the Italian Antitrust Authority (‘AGCM’) announced an investigation to determine
whether Roche, Genentech and Novartis had entered into an agreement to restrict competition in the Italian market for drugs, with
reference in particular to Avastin (marketed by Roche) and Lucentis (marketed by Novartis). Avastin and Lucentis are two different
drugs that were developed and approved for different therapeutic purposes and contain different active pharmaceutical ingredients.
On 5 March 2014 the AGCM issued a verdict that alleges that Roche and Novartis colluded to artificially differentiate Avastin and
Lucentis in order to foster the sales of Lucentis in Italy. The AGCM fined Roche EUR 90.5 million and Novartis EUR 92 million. Roche
appealed the AGCM verdict to the Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale del Lazio (‘TAR’). On 2 December 2014 the TAR upheld the
decision by the AGCM. Roche strongly disagrees with the verdict of the TAR and has appealed to the Consiglio di Stato. On 30 May 2014
the Italian Ministry of Health notified Roche S.p.A. of its intention to seek damages related to this matter. In July 2014 Roche paid the
EUR 90.5 million fine under protest to avoid additional penalty fees and recorded an expense within general and administration. The fine
and related interest will be reimbursed if Roche wins the case. On 23 January 2018 the European Court of Justice rendered its decision
on five questions which were referred to the European Court of Justice by the Consiglio di Stato. The principles defined in this decision
will be used by the Consiglio di Stato to render their final verdict on the case. The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at
this time.
PDL-1 inhibitor litigation. On 26 July 2017 Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (‘BMS’) filed a lawsuit against Genentech, Inc. (‘Genentech’) in
Delaware. BMS alleges that Genentech’s sale of Tecentriq infringes their US Patent No. 9,402,899. BMS is seeking judgment in its favour,
a finding of wilfulness and monetary damages. On 4 October 2017 Genentech filed its answer and counterclaims, seeking a declaratory
judgment of invalidity of the 9,402,899 patent. The trial date is scheduled for May 2020. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined
at this time.
Average Wholesale Prices litigation. HLR and Roche Laboratories Inc. (‘RLI’), along with approximately 50 other brand and generic
pharmaceutical companies, have been named as defendants in several legal actions in the US relating to the pricing of pharmaceutical
drugs and State Medicaid reimbursement. The primary allegation in these litigations is that the pharmaceutical companies misrepresented
or otherwise reported inaccurate Average Wholesale Prices (‘AWP’) and/or Wholesale Acquisition Costs (‘WAC’) for their drugs, which
prices were allegedly relied upon by the states in calculating Medicaid reimbursements to entities such as retail pharmacies. The states,
through their respective Attorney General, are seeking repayment of the amounts they claim were over-reimbursed. The time period
associated with these cases is 1991 through 2005. At 31 December 2018 HLR and RLI are defending one AWP action filed in the state
of New Jersey. HLR and RLI are vigorously defending themselves and no trial date has been set. The outcome of this matter cannot be
determined at this time.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 83Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Boniva litigation. HLR, Genentech and various other Roche affiliates (collectively ‘Roche’) have been named as defendants in numerous
legal actions in the US and one now dismissed case in Canada relating to the post-menopausal osteoporosis medication Boniva. In these
litigations, the plaintiffs allege that Boniva caused either osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypical femoral fractures. At 31 December 2018
Roche is defending approximately 259 actions involving approximately 300 plaintiffs brought in federal and state courts throughout the
US for personal injuries allegedly resulting from the use of Boniva. All of these cases are in the early discovery stages of litigation.
Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including many that are unique to the particular case. Roche is vigorously defending
itself in these matters. The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
In addition, the matters listed below do not currently have provisions recorded, but there are potential future obligations which will
be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events or where the obligation cannot be measured with
sufficient reliability.
Hemlibra (emicizumab) litigation. On 4 May 2017 Baxalta Inc. and Baxalta GmbH (both together ‘Baxalta’), subsidiaries of Shire plc.,
filed a patent infringement and declaratory judgment of patent infringement suit in the US District Court for the District of Delaware,
alleging that Genentech and Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (‘Chugai’) currently or imminently would manufacture, use, sell, offer for
sale, or import into the US Hemlibra (emicizumab), which would infringe Baxalta’s US Patent No. 7,033,590. Baxalta is seeking a judgment
of infringement, injunctive and monetary relief, attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses. On 11 May 2017 Genentech was served with the
complaint. Genentech’s response and counterclaims to the complaint were filed on 30 June 2017. On 19 June 2017 Chugai waived
service. On 13 September 2017 Chugai filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. On 14 December 2017
Baxalta filed a request for a preliminary injunction against Genentech only, in which some inhibitor patients would not be subject to any
injunction. A hearing was held in the US District Court for the District of Delaware on 13 and 14 June 2018 and during that hearing
Baxalta withdrew its request for a preliminary injunction as to the inhibitor patients. On 25 June 2018 Baxalta submitted a new proposed
preliminary injunction order, in which Genentech would be permitted to sell Hemlibra to all inhibitor patients, all non-inhibitor patients
currently on Hemlibra whether through clinical trials or not, and selected non-inhibitor patients who have an additional ‘medically
diagnosed condition’ which rendered factor VIII therapies impracticable. On 7 August 2018 the US District Court ruled against Baxalta,
denying their request for an injunction. On 19 September 2018 Chugai was dismissed from this case. A trial is scheduled for
September 2019.
On 28 March 2018, in the case brought by Baxalta against Chugai in Japan, the Tokyo District Court ruled in favour of Chugai, notably
that Hemlibra does not infringe Baxalta’s patent. On 10 May 2018 Baxalta appealed this decision.
On 16 November 2017 the Food and Drug Administration (‘FDA’) approved Hemlibra for haemophilia A with inhibitors for use in the US.
On 4 October 2018 the FDA approved the use of Hemlibra in the US for treatment in the non-inhibitor patient population. The outcome
of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Securities litigation. On 6 June 2017 a class action was filed in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey against Roche
Holding Ltd and two of its current officers. The lawsuit brings claims under the federal securities laws in connection with the Group’s
public disclosures, in particular with respect to matters relating to two of Roche’s drugs, Herceptin and Perjeta. On 24 September 2018
the District Court dismissed the case concluding that there was nothing misleading in those public disclosures. Subsequently plaintiffs
filed a second amended complaint. The Group will vigorously defend itself in this matter. The outcome of this matter cannot be
determined at this time.
Iraqi Ministry of Health. In October 2017 F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (‘FHLR’), Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (‘HLR’) and Genentech and
certain other pharmaceutical and/or medical device companies were named as defendants in a complaint filed in the Federal District
Court for the District of Columbia, US, on behalf of US service-members and their relatives who allege that they were killed or injured
in Iraq between 2005 and 2009 (the ‘Iraq lawsuit’). The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the US Anti-Terrorism Act and
various state laws by providing funding for terrorist organisations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and/or
medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health. In addition FHLR received an inquiry in July 2018 from the US Department
of Justice in connection with an anti-corruption investigation relating to activities in Iraq, including interactions with the Iraqi government
and certain of the same matters alleged in the Iraq lawsuit. The Group will vigorously defend itself in this matter. The outcome of this
matter cannot be determined at this time.
Arbitration against Chugai. In May 2017 Medical Research Council and LifeArc (formerly Medical Research Council Technology)
requested arbitration against Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. with an arbitrator being appointed on 9 August 2017. In April 2018
United Kingdom Research and Innovation (‘UKRI’) was established and became the successor in title to the Medical Research Council,
and the current claimants in the arbitration are LifeArc and UKRI. Sums are sought from Chugai for alleged breach of obligations
under a collaboration agreement dated 15 August 1990 in connection with the development of the humanised anti-human IL-6 receptor
monoclonal antibody, Actemra/RoActemra. It is claimed that Chugai is obliged to pay royalties to the claimants pursuant to the
collaboration agreement. Chugai considers that the claims are without merit and Chugai will vigorously defend itself in the arbitration.
The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Genentech transaction
The Group completed the purchase of the non-controlling interests in Genentech effective 26 March 2009. Based on the International
Accounting Standard 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ (IAS 27) and consistent with the International Financial Reporting Standard
10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ (IFRS 10), which was adopted by the Group in 2013, this transaction was accounted for
in full as an equity transaction. As a consequence, the carrying amount of the consolidated equity of the Group at that time was
reduced by CHF 52.2 billion, of which CHF 8.5 billion was allocated to eliminate the book value of Genentech non-controlling interests.
This accounting effect significantly impacted the Group’s net equity, but has no effect on the Group’s business or its dividend policy.
Share capital
At 31 December 2018 the authorised and issued share capital of Roche Holding Ltd, which is the Group’s parent company, consisted
of 160 million shares with a nominal value of CHF 1.00 each, as in the preceding year. The shares are bearer shares and the Group
does not maintain a register of shareholders. Based on information supplied to the Group, a shareholder group with pooled voting rights
owns 45.01% (2017: 45.01%) of the issued shares. On 24 March 2011 the shareholder group announced that it would continue the
shareholder pooling agreement existing since 1948 with a modified shareholder composition. The shareholder group with pooled voting
rights now holds 72,018,000 shares, corresponding to 45.01% of the shares issued. This figure does not include any shares without
pooled voting rights that are held outside this group by individual members of the group. Ms Maja Oeri, formerly a member of the pool,
now holds 8,091,900 shares representing 5.057% of the voting rights independently of the pool. This is further described in Note 31.
Based on information supplied to the Group, Novartis Holding AG, Basel, owns 33.333% (participation below 331⁄3%) of the issued shares
(2017: 33.333%).
Non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
At 31 December 2018 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities have been authorised and were in issue as in the preceding year.
Under Swiss company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value, are not part of the share capital and cannot be
issued against a contribution which would be shown as an asset in the balance sheet of Roche Holding Ltd. Each non-voting equity
security confers the same rights as any of the shares to participate in the net profit and any remaining proceeds from liquidation
following repayment of the nominal value of the shares and, if any, participation certificates. In accordance with the law and the Articles
of Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd, the Company is entitled at all times to exchange all or some of the non-voting equity securities
into shares or participation certificates.
Dividends
On 13 March 2018 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of CHF 8.30 per share and non-voting equity security
(2017: CHF 8.20) in respect of the 2017 business year. The distribution to holders of outstanding shares and non-voting equity securities
totalled CHF 7,094 million (2017: CHF 6,998 million) and has been recorded against retained earnings in 2018. The Board of Directors
has proposed dividends for the 2018 business year of CHF 8.70 per share and non-voting equity security which, if approved, would result
in a total distribution to shareholders of CHF 7,504 million. This is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 5 March 2019.

23. Subsidiaries and associates
Chugai
Effective 1 October 2002 the Roche Group and Chugai completed an alliance to create a leading research-driven Japanese
pharmaceutical company, which was formed by the merger of Chugai and Roche’s Japanese pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Nippon Roche.
The merged company is known as Chugai.
Consolidated subsidiary. Chugai is a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group. This is based on the Group’s interest in Chugai
at 31 December 2018 of 61.3% (2017: 61.3%) and the Roche relationship with Chugai that is founded on the Basic Alliance, Licensing
and Research Collaboration Agreements.
The common stock of Chugai is publicly traded and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the stock code ‘TSE:4519’. Chugai
prepares financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that are filed on a quarterly basis
with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to certain consolidation entries there are minor differences between Chugai’s stand-alone IFRS
results and the results of Chugai as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS.

and have been recorded against non-controlling interests (see Note 24). Dividends paid by Chugai to Roche are eliminated on
consolidation as intercompany items.
92 | Roche Finance Report 2018Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Roche’s relationship with Chugai. Chugai has entered into certain agreements with Roche, which are discussed below:
(1) Basic Alliance Agreement – As part of the Basic Alliance Agreement signed in December 2001, Roche and Chugai entered into
certain arrangements covering the future operation and governance of Chugai. Amongst other matters these cover the following areas:
• The structuring of the alliance.
• Roche’s rights as a shareholder.
• Roche’s rights to nominate members of Chugai’s Board of Directors.
• Certain limitations to Roche’s ability to buy or sell Chugai’s common stock.
Chugai issues additional shares of common stock in connection with its convertible debt and equity compensation plans, and may issue
additional shares for other purposes, which affects Roche’s percentage ownership interest. The Basic Alliance Agreement provides,
amongst other matters, that Chugai will guarantee Roche’s right to maintain its shareholding percentage in Chugai at not less than 50.1%.
(2) Licensing Agreements – Under the Japan Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in December 2001, Chugai has exclusive rights
to market Roche’s pharmaceutical products in Japan. Chugai also has the right of first refusal on the development and marketing in
Japan of all development compounds advanced by Roche.
The Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement (excluding Japan and South Korea) signed in May 2002 was revised and the Amended
and Restated Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement (excluding Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) was signed in August 2014.
Under this Agreement Roche has the right of first refusal on the development and marketing of Chugai’s development compounds in
markets outside Japan, excluding South Korea and Taiwan.
Further to these agreements, Roche and Chugai have signed a series of separate agreements for certain specific products. Depending
on the specific circumstances and the terms of the agreement, this may result in payments on an arm’s length basis between Roche
and Chugai, for any or all of the following matters:
• Upfront payments, if a right of first refusal to license a product is exercised.
• Milestone payments, dependent upon the achievement of agreed performance targets.
• Royalties on future product sales.
These specific product agreements may also cover the manufacture and supply of the respective products to meet the other party’s
clinical and/or commercial requirements on an arm’s length basis.
(3) Research Collaboration Agreements – Roche and Chugai have entered into research collaboration agreements in the areas of small-
molecule synthetic drug research and biotechnology-based drug discovery.
Foundation Medicine
On 7 April 2015 the Group acquired a 61.3% controlling interest in Foundation Medicine, Inc. (‘FMI’), a publicly owned US company
based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and entered into an Investor Rights Agreement, a Research and Development Collaboration
Agreement and several Commercial Collaboration Agreements. FMI has been treated as a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group
since that date. At 31 December 2017 the Group’s interest in FMI was 57.5%. The common stock of FMI was publicly traded and was
listed on the Nasdaq under the stock code ‘FMI’. FMI prepared financial statements in accordance with US GAAP that were filed on
a quarterly basis with the SEC. Due to certain consolidation entries there have been differences between FMI’s stand-alone US GAAP
results and the results of FMI as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS.
On 18 June 2018 the Group entered into a merger agreement with FMI to acquire the outstanding shares of FMI’s common stock not
already owned by the Group at a price of USD 137.00 per share in cash. A tender offer was launched on 2 July 2018. On 31 July 2018
the transaction closed and FMI became a 100% owned subsidiary of the Group. It has been accounted for in full as an equity transaction
(see Note 6).
Dividends. There were no dividends distributed to third parties holding FMI shares during 2018 and 2017.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 93Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Associates
Senseonics Holding, Inc. (‘Senseonics’) has been treated as an associate of the Group and at 31 December 2018 the Group’s interest in
Senseonics was 16.0% (31 December 2017: 20.7%). The Group is the exclusive distributor for Senseonics’ Eversense product solution in
major markets outside the US. In the opinion of management this gives the Group the potential to exercise significant influence over the
operations of the Senseonics business. The common stock of Senseonics is publicly traded and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE-MKT) under the stock code ‘SENS’. Senseonics prepares financial statements in accordance with US GAAP that are filed on a
quarterly basis with the SEC. The Group accounts for Senseonics using the equity method based on Senseonics’ financial statements that
are publicly available. The Group’s share of Senseonics’ results, a profit of CHF 6 million, is included in other financial income (expense)
(see Note 4) and the carrying value of the Group’s share of Senseonics’ net assets at 31 December 2018, an asset of CHF 42 million,
is included in other non-current assets (see Note 15).
Divestment of subsidiaries
Divestment of subsidiaries – 2018. On 30 November 2018 the Group sold its wholly owned subsidiary Roche Diagnostics IT Solutions
GmbH in Berlin, Germany, to a third party. The total consideration was EUR 2 million, all of which was deferred consideration that will
become due on 30 November 2021. A total loss on divestment of CHF 24 million was reported as global restructuring costs in
the Diagnostics operating segment and included in general and administration.
During 2018 the Group received deferred consideration of EUR 4 million from the sale of the former subsidiary at the Segrate site, Italy,
to a third party.
Divestment of subsidiaries – 2017. On 1 February 2017 the Group sold its wholly owned subsidiary Roche Carolina Inc. in Florence,
US, to a third party as part of the previously announced Pharmaceuticals Division’s strategic realignment of its manufacturing network.
On 1 September 2017 the Group sold its wholly owned subsidiary at the Segrate site, Italy, to a third party as part of the previously
announced Pharmaceuticals Division’s strategic realignment of its manufacturing network.

26. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group’s objective is to provide attractive and competitive post-employment benefits to employees, while at the same time ensuring
that the various plans are appropriately financed and managing any potential impacts on the Group’s long-term financial position. Most
employees are covered by pension plans sponsored by Group companies. The nature of such plans varies according to legal regulations,
fiscal requirements and market practice in the countries in which the employees are employed. Post-employment benefit plans are
classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund or to a third-party financial
institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. All other plans are classified as ‘defined
benefit plans’.
Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans are funded through payments by employees and by the Group to funds administered by third parties.
The Group’s expenses for these plans were CHF 419 million (2017: CHF 482 million). No assets or liabilities are recognised in the Group’s
balance sheet in respect of such plans, apart from regular prepayments and accruals of the contributions withheld from employees’
wages and salaries and of the Group’s contributions. The Group’s major defined contribution plan is the US Roche 401(k) Savings Plan.
Defined benefit plans
Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by payments from Group companies and by employees.
In some cases, notably for the major defined benefit plans in Germany, the plans are unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired
employees directly from its own financial resources. Plans are usually governed by a senior governing body, such as a Board of Trustees,
which is typically composed of both employee and employer representatives. Funding of these plans is determined by local regulations
using independent actuarial valuations. Separate independent actuarial valuations are prepared in accordance with the requirements
of IAS 19 for use in the Group’s financial statements. The Group’s major pension plans are located in Switzerland, the US and Germany,
which in total account for 84% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation (2017: 82%).
96 | Roche Finance Report 2018Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Pension plans in Switzerland. Current pension arrangements for employees in Switzerland are made through plans governed by the
Swiss Federal Occupational Old Age, Survivors and Disability Pension Act (‘BVG’). The Group’s pension plans are administered by
separate legal foundations, which are funded by regular employee and company contributions. The final benefit is contribution-based
with certain minimum guarantees. Due to these minimum guarantees, the Swiss plans are treated as defined benefit plans for the
purposes of these IFRS financial statements, although they have many of the characteristics of defined contribution plans. Where there
is an under-funding, this may be remedied by various measures such as increasing employee and company contributions, lowering
the interest rate on retirement account balances, reducing prospective benefits and a suspension of the early withdrawal facility.
Following a plan change in 2018 the Employee Profit-Sharing Plan (‘Mitarbeiter-Gewinnbeteiligung’) no longer qualifies as a defined
contribution plan but as a defined benefit plan. This resulted in additions to plan assets and defined benefit obligation of approximately
CHF 1.1 billion. In 2018 operating income of CHF 43 million was recorded for past service cost from this plan change in Switzerland.
Of this amount, CHF 31 million was recorded in the Pharmaceuticals Division, CHF 7 million in the Diagnostics Division and CHF 5 million
in Corporate. The past service income was recorded within general and administration.
Pension plans in the US. The Group’s major defined benefit plans in the US have been closed to new members since 2007. New
employees in the US now join the defined contribution plan. The largest of the remaining defined benefit plans are funded pension
plans together with smaller unfunded supplementary retirement plans. The benefits are based on the highest average annual rate of
earnings during a specified period and length of employment. The plans are non-contributory for employees, with the Group making
periodic payments to the plans. Where there is an under-funding, this would normally be remedied by additional company contributions.
In 2018 payments made by the Group were USD 186 million (2017: USD 80 million). The increase in payments compared to 2017 is due
to accelerated contributions to benefit from a higher tax deduction. In 2017 the Group entered into an annuity buyout agreement with
an insurance company and paid USD 330 million from plan assets to settle the defined benefit obligation for some retired employees.
This led to a settlement loss of USD 10 million in 2017.
Pension plans in Germany. The Group’s major pension arrangements in Germany are governed by the Occupational Pensions Act
(‘BetrAVG’). These plans are unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources.
These plans are non-contributory for employees. The benefits are based on final salary and length of employment. These plans have
been closed to new members since 2007. They have been replaced by a new plan which is funded by regular employee and company
contributions and administered through a contractual trust agreement. The final benefit is contribution-based with a minimum guarantee.
Due to this minimum guarantee, this plan is treated as a defined benefit plan for the purposes of these IFRS financial statements,
although it has many of the characteristics of a defined contribution plan.
Pension plans in the Rest of the World. These represent approximately 11% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation (2017: 12%) and
consist of a number of smaller plans in various countries. Of these the largest are the pension plans at Chugai, which are independently
managed by Chugai, and the main pension plan in the United Kingdom. The Chugai plans are fully described in Chugai’s own IFRS
financial statements. The UK pension plan is funded by regular employee and company contributions, with benefits based on final salary
and length of employment. This plan has been closed to new members since 2003 and has been replaced with a defined contribution
plan. In relation to the restructuring of the manufacturing site at Clarecastle, Ireland, the Group entered into an annuity buyout agreement
with an insurance company in 2017 and paid EUR 97 million from plan assets to settle the defined benefit obligation for all retired
employees. In addition transfer value payments of EUR 14 million from plan assets were made to deferred employees to settle the defined
benefit obligation. The Group recorded a settlement loss of EUR 11 million from these transactions in 2017.
Other post-employment benefit (‘OPEB’) plans. These represent approximately 5% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation (2017: 6%)
and consist of post-employment healthcare and life insurance schemes, mainly in the US. These plans are mainly unfunded and/or are
contributory for employees, with the Group reimbursing retired employees directly from its own financial resources. The Group’s major
OPEB plans in the US have been closed to new members since 2011. Part of the costs of these plans is reimbursable under the Medicare
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. There is no statutory funding requirement for these plans. The Group
is funding these plans to the extent that it is tax efficient. In 2018 payments made by the Group to these plans were USD 40 million
(2017: none). At 31 December 2018 the IFRS funding status was 47% (2017: 43%), including reimbursement rights, for the funded OPEB
plans in the US.

of the respective jurisdiction in which the plan is established. Qualified independent actuaries carry out statutory actuarial valuations on
a regular basis. The actuarial assumptions determining the funding status on the statutory basis are regularly assessed by the local senior
governing body. The funding status is closely monitored at a corporate level. The unfunded plans are mainly those in the Group’s German
affiliates, where the fully reserved pension obligations are used for self-financing of the local affiliate’s operations.
In 2018 the IFRS funding status of the funded defined benefit plans improved to 93% (2017: 91%).
Reimbursement rights are linked to the post-employment medical plans in the US and represent the expected reimbursement of the
medical expenditure provided under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003.

Plan assets
The responsibility for the investment strategies of funded plans is with the respective senior governance body, such as the Board of
Trustees. Asset-liability studies are performed regularly for all major pension plans. These studies examine the obligations from post-
employment benefit plans, and evaluate various investment strategies with respect to key financial measures such as expected returns,
expected risks, expected contributions, and expected funded status of the plan in an interdependent way. The goal of an asset-liability
study is to select an appropriate asset allocation for the funds held within the plan. The investment strategy is developed to optimise
expected returns, to manage risks and to contain fluctuations in the statutory funded status. Asset-liability studies include strategies to
match the cash flows of the assets with the plan obligations. The Group currently does not use longevity swaps to manage longevity risk.
Plan assets are managed using internal and external asset managers. The actual performance is continually monitored by the pension
fund governance bodies as well as being closely monitored at a corporate level. In these financial statements the difference between
the interest income and actual return on plan assets is a remeasurement that is recorded directly to other comprehensive income.
During 2018 the actual return on plan assets was a loss of CHF 413 million (2017: gain of CHF 1,381 million).
The recognition of plan assets is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available from refunds from the plans or reductions
in future contributions to the plans.

Assets are invested in a variety of different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return as follows:
• Equity and debt securities which mainly have quoted market prices (Level 1 fair value hierarchy).
• Property which is primarily in private and commercial property funds which mainly have other observable inputs (Level 2 fair value
hierarchy).
• Cash and money market instruments which are mainly invested with financial institutions with a credit rating no lower than A.
• Other investments which mainly consist of alternatives, mortgages, commodities and insurance contracts. These are used for risk
management purposes and mainly have other observable inputs (Level 2 fair value hierarchy) and unobservable inputs (Level 3
fair value hierarchy).
Included within the fair value of plan assets are the Group’s shares and non-voting securities with a fair value of CHF 136 million
(2017: CHF 121 million) and debt instruments issued by the Group with a fair value of CHF 5 million (2017: CHF 9 million).

Defined benefit obligation
The defined benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method. This reflects service rendered by employees to
the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the present value
of benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth and mortality rates. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined
by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds in countries
where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. The corporate or government bonds are denominated in the currency in which the
benefits will be paid, and have maturity terms approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
The Group’s final salary-based defined benefit pension plans in the US, Germany and the United Kingdom have been closed to new
participants. Active employees that had been members of these pension plans at the time these were closed to new participants continue
to accrue benefits in the final salary-based defined benefit pension plans. New employees in the US and UK now join the Group’s
defined contribution plans, while new employees in Germany join the contribution-based plan with a minimum guarantee. As a result,
the proportion of the defined benefit obligation which relates to these closed plans is expected to decrease in the future. The defined
benefit pension plans in Switzerland, where the final benefit is contribution-based with a minimum guarantee, remain open to new
employees.

Actuarial assumptions
The actuarial assumptions used in these financial statements are based on the requirements set out in IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’.
They are unbiased and mutually compatible estimates of variables that determine the ultimate cost of providing post-employment
benefits. They are set on an annual basis by local management, based on advice from actuaries, and are subject to approval by corporate
management and the Group’s actuaries. Actuarial assumptions consist of demographic assumptions on matters such as mortality and
employee turnover, and financial assumptions on matters such as interest rates, salary and benefit levels, inflation rates and costs
of medical benefits. The actuarial assumptions vary based upon local economic and social conditions. The actuarial assumptions used
in the various statutory valuations may differ from these based on local legal and regulatory requirements.
Demographic assumptions. The most significant demographic assumptions relate to mortality rates. The Group’s actuaries use mortality
tables which take into account historic patterns and expected changes, such as further increases in longevity. Rates of employee
turnover, disability and early retirement are based on historical behaviour. The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual
at the age of 65 is as follows:
Defined benefit plans: average life expectancy at the age of 65 for major schemes in years

1) For 2017 RP-2014 tables projected with MP-2014 data were used.
2) For 2017 Heubeck tables 2005G were used.
The mortality assumptions used for the pension plans in Switzerland were based on BVG 2015 applying the Continuous Mortality
Investigation (‘CMI’) model. A long-term rate of 1.25% (2017: 1.25%) was used for longevity improvements.
At 31 December 2018 the Group used as mortality assumptions for the pension plans in Germany Heubeck tables 2018G applying
the CMI model with a long-term rate of 1.25% for longevity improvements.
Financial assumptions. These are based on market expectations for the period over which the obligations are to be settled.
The assumptions used in the actuarial valuations are shown below.

Weighted Weighted

Ultimate medical cost trend rate (in 2038) 4.37% 4.00%–4.50% 4.50% 4.50%
Discount rates are determined with reference to interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds in countries where
there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. Expected rates of salary increases are based on expected inflation rates with an adjustment
to reflect the Group’s latest expectation of long-term real salary increases. Expected rates of pension increases are generally linked to
the expected inflation rate or the funding status of the plan. Expected inflation rates are derived by looking at the level of inflation implied
by the financial markets in conjunction with the economists’ price inflation forecasts, historic price inflation as well as other economic
variables and circumstances. Medical cost trend rates take into account the benefits set out in the plan terms and expected future
changes in medical costs. Since the Group’s major post-employment medical plans are for US employees, these rates are driven by
developments in the US.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 101Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Sensitivity analysis. The measurement of the net defined benefit obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate,
inflation rate, expected mortality and medical cost trend rate assumptions. The following table summarises the impact of a change in
those assumptions on the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
Defined benefit plans: sensitivity of defined benefit obligation to actuarial assumptions in millions of CHF
2018 2017
Increase (decrease) in defined benefit obligation
Life expectancy
– 1 year increase 735 635

– 0.25% decrease (209) (242)
Immediate medical cost trend rate
– 1.00% increase 139 156
– 1.00% decrease (97) (129)
Each sensitivity analysis considers the change in one assumption at a time leaving the other assumptions unchanged. This approach
shows the isolated effect of changing one individual assumption but does not take into account that some assumptions are related.
The method used to carry out the sensitivity analysis is the same as in the prior year.
Cash flows
The Group incurred cash flows from its defined benefit plans as shown in the table below.
Defined benefit plans: cash flows in millions of CHF

Employer contributions, net of reimbursements – funded plans (613) (392)
Benefits paid – unfunded plans (172) (146)
Total cash inflow (outflow) (785) (538)
Based on the most recent actuarial valuations, the Group expects that employer contributions for funded plans in 2019 will be approximately
CHF 401 million, which includes an estimated CHF 25 million of additional contributions related to the UK defined benefit plans. Benefits
paid for unfunded plans in 2019 are estimated to be approximately CHF 182 million, which mostly relate to the German defined benefit plans.

27. Equity compensation plans
The Group operates several equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Chugai and Foundation Medicine. IFRS 2
‘Share-based Payment’ requires that the fair value of all equity compensation plan awards granted to employees be estimated at grant
date and recorded as an expense over the vesting period.

Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights. The Group issues Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) to certain
directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The S-SARs give employees the right to receive non-
voting equity securities reflecting the value of any appreciation in the market price of the non-voting equity securities between the
grant date and the exercise date. Under the Roche S-SAR Plan 180 million S-SARs will be available for issuance over a ten-year period.
The rights, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years.

Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan. The Group issues Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) awards to certain directors, management and
employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The RSUs, which are non-tradable, represent the right to receive non-voting equity
securities which vest only after a three-year period, subject to performance conditions, if any. There are currently no performance
conditions on outstanding RSUs at 31 December 2018. Under the Roche RSU Plan 20 million non-voting equity securities will be available
for issuance over a ten-year period. The Roche RSU Plan also includes a value adjustment which will be an amount equivalent to the
sum of shareholder distributions made by the Group during the vesting period attributable to the number of non-voting equity securities
for which an individual award has been granted.

Roche Performance Share Plan. The Group offers future share and non-voting equity security awards (or, at the discretion of the
Board of Directors, their cash equivalent) to certain directors and key senior managers. These are non-tradable equity-settled awards.
The programme currently operates in annual three-year cycles. The Roche Performance Share Plan (PSP) includes a value adjustment
which will be an amount equivalent to the sum of shareholder distributions made by the Group during the vesting period attributable to
the number of shares or non-voting equity securities for which an individual award has been granted. The amount of shares or non-voting
equity securities allocated will depend upon the individual’s salary level, the achievement of performance targets linked to the Group’s
Total Shareholder Return (shares and non-voting equity securities combined) relative to the Group’s peers during the three-year period
from the date of the grant, and the discretion of the Board of Directors. Each award will result in between zero and two shares or non-
voting equity securities (before value adjustment), depending upon the achievement of the performance targets.

Roche Connect. This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the US and certain other countries, to make
regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting equity securities. It is administered by independent third parties. The Group
contributes to the programme, which allows the employees to purchase non-voting equity securities at a discount (usually 20%).
The administrator purchases the necessary non-voting equity securities directly from the market. At 31 December 2018 the administrator
held 3.1 million non-voting equity securities (2017: 2.8 million). In 2018 the cost of the plan was CHF 24 million (2017: CHF 23 million).
Roche Option Plan. This programme is used in countries where S-SARs are not used. Awards under this plan give employees the right
to purchase non-voting equity securities at an exercise price specified at the grant date. The options, which are non-tradable equity-
settled awards, have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years.

d) The early exercise factor describes the ratio between the expected market price at the exercise date and the exercise price at which early exercises can be expected,
based on historically observed behaviour.

29. Statement of cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities arise from the Group’s primary activities in the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics Divisions.
These are calculated using the indirect method by adjusting the Group’s operating profit for any operating income and expenses that
are not cash flows (for example depreciation, amortisation and impairment) in order to derive the cash generated from operations.
This and other operating cash flows are shown in the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flows also include income taxes paid on
all activities.

Cash flows from investing activities
Cash flows from investing activities are principally those arising from the Group’s investments in property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets, and from the acquisition and divestment of subsidiaries, associates and businesses. Cash flows connected with
the Group’s portfolio of marketable securities and other investments are also included, as are any interest and dividend payments
received in respect of these securities and investments. These cash flows indicate the Group’s net reinvestment in its operating assets
and the cash flow effects of business combinations and divestments, as well as the cash generated by the Group’s other investments.

30. Risk management
Group risk management
Risk management is a fundamental element of the Group’s business practice on all levels and encompasses different types of risks.
At Group level, risk management is an integral part of the long-term forecasting and controlling processes. Material risks are monitored
and regularly discussed with the Corporate Executive Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising from its underlying operations and corporate finance activities. The Group’s
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices as well as
the creditworthiness and the solvency of the Group’s counterparties.
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies reviewed by the boards of directors of Roche and Chugai as
appropriate to their areas of statutory responsibility. These policies cover credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. The policies provide
guidance on risk limits, types of authorised financial instruments and monitoring procedures. As a general principle, the policies prohibit
the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Policy implementation and day-to-day risk management
are carried out by the relevant treasury functions and regular reporting on these risks is performed by the relevant accounting and
controlling functions within Roche and Chugai.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations, causing financial losses for
the Group. The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses of liquid funds deposited with or invested in such
counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering netting agreements and
without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements, is equal to the carrying value of the Group’s financial assets.
The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the counterparty is unlikely to pay its obligations to the Group in full.
In assessing whether a counterparty is in default, the Group considers both qualitative and quantitative indicators (e.g. overdue status)
that are based on data developed internally and for certain financial assets are also obtained from external sources. A major part
of the Group’s receivables which are past due more than 90 days relate to public customers. Risk of default of public customers is
considered low. The Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is
more appropriate for this particular customer segment.
Accounts receivable. At 31 December 2018 the Group has trade receivables of CHF 10.7 billion (2017: CHF 10.4 billion). These are
subject to a policy of active credit risk management which focuses on the assessment of country risk, credit availability, ongoing
credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures. The objective of trade receivables management is to maximise the collection
of unpaid amounts.
The Group uses an allowance matrix to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for all trade receivables. The expected credit loss
(‘ECL’) rate is based on the Group’s historical experience and the Group’s expectation of economic conditions over the period until
receivables are expected to be paid.

At 31 December 2018 the Group’s combined trade receivables balance with three US national wholesale distributors, McKesson Corp.,
AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Cardinal Health, Inc., was equivalent to CHF 2.7 billion representing 25% of the Group’s consolidated trade
receivables (2017: CHF 2.4 billion representing 23%). There is no other significant concentration of counterparty credit risk due to the
Group’s large number of customers and their wide geographical spread. Risk limits and exposures are continuously monitored by country
and by the nature of counterparties. The Group obtains credit insurance and similar enhancements when appropriate to protect the
collection of trade receivables. At 31 December 2018 no collateral was held for trade receivables (2017: none).
Since 2010 there have been financial difficulties in Southern European countries, notably Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. The Group
is a leading supplier to the healthcare sectors in these countries and has trade receivables of CHF 0.8 billion (2017: CHF 0.9 billion)
with the public and private customers in these countries. The Group uses different measures to improve collections in these countries,
including intense communication with customers, factoring, negotiations of payment plans, charging of interest for late payments,
and legal actions.
The nature and geographic location of counterparties to accounts receivable that are not overdue or impaired are shown in the table
below. These include the balances with US national wholesalers and Southern Europe public customers described above.

Cash and marketable securities (excluding equity securities). At 31 December 2018 the Group has cash and marketable securities
(excluding equity securities) of CHF 13.1 billion (2017: CHF 12.0 billion). These are subject to a policy of restricting exposures to high-
quality counterparties and setting defined limits for individual counterparties. These limits and counterparty credit ratings are reviewed
regularly.
110 | Roche Finance Report 2018Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Cash and cash equivalents are held with banks and financial institutions, which are predominantly rated as investment grade (97% and
96% in 2018 and 2017, respectively), based on Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s ratings. Cash and short-term time deposits are subject
to rules which limit the Group’s exposure to individual financial institutions.
Impairment on cash and cash equivalents is measured on a 12-month expected credit losses (‘ECL’) basis with a reference to external
credit ratings of the counterparties, and reflect the short maturities of the exposures. The Group considers that its cash and cash
equivalents have low credit risk based on these external credit ratings.
Investments in marketable securities (excluding equity securities) are entered into on the basis of guidelines with regard to liquidity,
quality and maximum amount. As a general rule, the Group invests only in high-quality securities with adequate liquidity and with
counterparties that have a credit rating of at least Baa3 from Moody’s and BBB- from Standard & Poor’s.
The credit risk of the counterparties with external ratings below investment grade or non-rated is closely monitored and reviewed on
an individual basis.

1) The loss allowance related to fair value through OCI does not affect the carrying amount of marketable securities (excluding equity securities) but is booked against
corresponding OCI reserve instead.
Debt securities at amortised cost and those at fair value through OCI are investment grade and therefore considered to be low risk,
and thus the impairment allowance is determined at 12-month expected credit losses (‘ECL’) with a reference to external credit ratings
of the counterparties. There were no debt securities for which the Group observed a significant increase in the credit risk which would
require the application of the lifetime expected credit losses impairment model. There was no material impact resulting from the revised
impairment approach under IFRS 9. In addition, there were no material movements in the loss allowance in 2018.
Master netting agreements. The Group enters into derivative transactions and collateral agreements under International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements with the respective counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty risk.
Under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same
currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria
for offsetting in the balance sheet as the Group does not have a currently enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, because the
right to offset is only enforceable on the occurrence of future events, such as a default or other credit events.
Contract terms. At 31 December 2018 there are no significant financial assets whose terms have been renegotiated (2017: none).
Impairment losses. During 2018 total impairment losses for all financial assets excluding equity investments/securities (IFRS 9)
amounted to CHF 1 million. During 2017 total impairment losses for available-for-sale assets (IAS 39) amounted to CHF 17 million.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time. The Group’s
approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements at any point in time.
Roche and Chugai enjoy strong credit quality and are rated by at least one major credit rating agency. The ratings will permit efficient
access to the international capital markets in the event of major financing requirements. At 31 December 2018 the Group has unused
committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling CHF 7.7 billion (2017: CHF 7.6 billion), of which CHF 7.4 billion serve
as a back-stop line for the commercial paper program.

Take-or-pay commitments. The Group has entered into contract manufacturing agreements with various companies to further
develop manufacturing capacity and flexibility, mainly in the Pharmaceuticals Division. There are future minimum take-or-pay
commitments within some of these agreements with a total potential commitment from the Group of CHF 1.4 billion at 31 December 2018
(2017: CHF 1.9 billion).
Market risk
Market risk arises from changing market prices, mainly foreign exchange rates and interest rates, of the Group’s financial assets or
financial liabilities which affect the Group’s financial result and equity.
Value-at-Risk. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to measure the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. VaR indicates
the value range within which a given financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market
prices. VaR is calculated using a historical simulation approach and for each scenario, all financial instruments are fully valued and
the total change in value and earnings is determined. VaR calculations are based on a 95% confidence level and a holding period of
20 trading days over the past ten years. This holding period reflects the time required to change the corresponding risk exposure,
should this be deemed appropriate.
Actual future gains and losses associated with our treasury activities may differ materially from the VaR analyses due to the inherent
limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes to interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity investment
prices, particularly in periods of high market volatilities. Furthermore, VaR does not include the effect of changes in credit spreads.

VaR – Other price component 32 38
Diversification (40) (43)
VaR – Total market risk 321 325
The interest rate component remained largely stable. The foreign exchange component decreased due to a favourable exposure mix.
The other price component arises mainly from movements in equity security prices and decreased due to lower volatility in held assets.
112 | Roche Finance Report 2018Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Foreign exchange risk
The Group uses the Swiss franc as its reporting currency and as a result is exposed to movements in foreign currencies, mainly the
US dollar, Japanese yen and euro. The Group’s foreign exchange risk management strategy is to preserve the economic value of its
current and future assets and to minimise the volatility of the Group’s financial result. The primary focus of the Group’s foreign exchange
risk management activities is on hedging transaction exposures arising through foreign currency flows or monetary positions held
in foreign currencies. The Group uses forward contracts, foreign exchange options and cross-currency swaps to hedge transaction
exposures. Application of these instruments intends to continuously immunise against unfavourable developments of foreign exchange
rates.
Interest rate risk
The Group mainly raises debt on a fixed rate basis for bonds and notes. The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates, mainly for
its US dollar, Swiss franc and euro floating rate financial instruments and short-term debt. The Group’s interest rate risk management
strategy is to optimise the net interest result. The Group may use forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps to hedge its interest
rate exposures. Depending on the interest rate environment of major currencies, the Group will use these instruments to generate an
appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposures.
Other price risk
Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities. The Group manages the price risk through placing
limits on individual and total equity investments. These limits are defined both as a percentage of total liquid funds and as an absolute
number for individual equity investments.
Capital management
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total capitalisation, being the sum of debt plus equity, including non-controlling
interests. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide benefits for patients and returns
to investors.
• To provide an adequate return to investors based on the level of risk undertaken.
• To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver future benefits for patients
and returns to investors.
• To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The capitalisation is reported to senior management as part of the Group’s regular internal management reporting and is shown in
the table below.

The Group is not subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements as known in the financial services industry. The Group has
a majority shareholding in Chugai (see Note 23). Chugai is a public company and its objectives, policies and processes for managing
its own capital are determined by Chugai management.

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
• Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
• Level 2 – observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
• Level 3 – unobservable inputs.

The fair value hierarchy has been adjusted to reflect the presentational changes required as a result from implementing IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ as described in Note 33.
Level 1 financial assets consist of treasury bills, bonds and quoted shares. Level 2 financial assets consist primarily of commercial paper,
certificates of deposit and derivative financial instruments.
The Group determines Level 2 fair values using the following valuation techniques:
• Marketable securities and derivative financial instruments are based on valuation models that use observable market data for interest
rates, yield curves, foreign exchange rates and implied volatilities for similar instruments at the measurement date.
• Equity investments at fair value through OCI and at fair value through profit or loss (previously available-for-sale investments) are based
on a valuation model that uses the most recently published observable market data.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period during which the transfer
has occurred. There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and vice versa during the year (2017: none).
Time accounts over three months are accounted for at amortised cost under IFRS 9 and as a result are no longer included in the fair
value hierarchy analysis for 2018 (they were accounted for as available-for-sale under IAS 39 and therefore were included in the fair value
hierarchy in 2017).

During 2018 contingent consideration provisions decreased mainly due to the reversal of some of the provisions and to the payment
of milestones. There was CHF 79 million of income, net, mainly from the reversal of the remaining provision related to the Trophos
acquisition in 2015. Payments of CHF 14 million were made during 2018 for milestones related to the Dutalys and other acquisitions.
Contingent consideration arrangements
The Group is party to certain contingent consideration arrangements arising from business combinations. The fair values are determined
considering the expected payments, discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted average discount rate of 3.6% (2017: 3.1%).
The expected payments are determined by considering the possible scenarios of forecast sales and other performance criteria, the
amount to be paid under each scenario, and the probability of each scenario. The significant unobservable inputs are the forecast sales,
other performance criteria and the risk-adjusted discount rate. The estimated fair value would increase if the forecast sales or other
performance criteria rates were higher or the risk-adjusted discount rate was lower. At 31 December 2018 the total potential payments
under contingent consideration arrangements could be up to CHF 1.0 billion (2017: CHF 1.4 billion) as follows:

Derivative financial instruments
The Group has entered into various currency swaps for certain non-US dollar debt instruments. Cash collateral agreements were entered
into with the counterparties to the currency swaps to mitigate counterparty risk. The following table sets out the carrying value of
derivative financial instruments and the amounts that are subject to master netting agreements.

Hedge accounting
Upon transition to IFRS 9 (see Note 33) the Group elected not to restate comparative information. As a result certain information
required by IFRS 9 is provided for 2018 only.
As described above the Group’s risk management strategy is to hedge the transaction exposures arising through foreign currency flows
or monetary positions held in foreign currencies as well as to generate an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposures. The level
of hedging depends on market conditions and business requirements of the Group. The Group designates annually a specific interest
rate risk management objective to ensure that a predetermined range of its interest rate risk exposure is at a floating rate.
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness
assessments at each reporting date to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.
The Group performs a qualitative assessment of the hedge effectiveness using a critical terms match method. As the critical terms
of the hedged items and the hedging instruments match, the Group concludes that risks being hedged for the hedged items and the
hedging instruments are sufficiently aligned, that there is no inherent mismatch in the hedging relationship and that a 100% hedge
ratio applies both for the actual quantities hedged and for the hedge accounting.

The ineffective portion of the hedge accounting is recognised in the income statement and included in other financial income (expense).
It is measured using the hypothetical derivative method for cash flow hedges and the cumulative dollar offset method for fair value
hedges. At 31 December 2018 none of the above potential sources of ineffectiveness, individually or collectively, resulted in material
amounts of actual ineffectiveness being reported for any hedge accounting relationships.
The table below shows fair values and nominal amounts of derivative financial instruments, including a range of the timing of the
nominal amount of the hedging instruments, which are designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge and a fair value hedge.
At 31 December 2018 the Group has the following cash flow hedges and fair value hedges which are designated in a qualifying hedge
relationship:

The fair values of derivative financial instruments used for hedge accounting are included in other current assets (see Note 16) or other
current liabilities (see Note 19). The Group’s approach to managing market risk, including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk,
is discussed in the ‘Market risk’ section in this Note.
Cash flow hedges. The Group has entered into cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk on some of
the bonds and notes issued by the Group which are denominated in euro. At 31 December 2018 such instruments are recorded as
a net fair value liability of CHF 67 million (2017: CHF 9 million). There was no ineffective portion.
Chugai has entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge a part of its foreign translation exposure to Swiss franc and US dollar.
At 31 December 2018 such instruments are recorded as fair value assets of CHF 13 million and as fair value liabilities of CHF 12 million
(2017: fair value assets of CHF 4 million). There was no ineffective portion.

Fair value hedges. The Group has entered into some interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in the fair value of some
of its fixed-term debt instruments in respect of a benchmark interest rate. At 31 December 2018 such instruments are recorded as
fair value liabilities of CHF 22 million (2017: CHF 18 million) and fair value assets of CHF 7 million (2017: CHF 5 million). During 2018
fair value adjustments of CHF 2 million were recorded on these interest rate swaps (2017: CHF 28 million). As the fair value hedge had
been highly effective since inception, the result of the interest rate swaps was largely offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged
debt instruments. The Group’s approach to managing market risk, including interest rate risk, is discussed in the ‘Market risk’ section
in this Note.

33. Significant accounting policies
Consolidation policy
Subsidiaries are all companies over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Companies acquired during the year are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group, and subsidiaries to
be divested are included up to the date on which control passes from the Group. Intercompany balances, transactions and resulting
unrealised income are eliminated in full. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if
they occur after control has already been obtained and if they do not result in a loss of control. Associates are companies over which
the Group exercises, or has the power to exercise, significant influence, but which it does not control and they are accounted for
using the equity method.
Segment reporting
For the purpose of segment reporting the Group’s Corporate Executive Committee (CEC) is considered to be the Group’s Chief Operating
Decision Maker. The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the organisation units for which information is reported
to the CEC on a regular basis. The information provided is used as the basis of the segment revenue and profit disclosures reported in
Note 2, with the geographic analysis based on the location of customers. Selected segment balance sheet information is also routinely
provided to the CEC.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis. Operating assets and liabilities consist of property, plant
and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade receivables/payables, inventories and other assets and liabilities, such as provisions,
which can be reasonably attributed to the reported operating segments. Non-operating assets and liabilities mainly include current
and deferred income tax balances, post-employment benefit assets/liabilities and financial assets/liabilities such as cash, marketable
securities, investments and debt.
Foreign currency translation
The Annual Financial Statements are presented in Swiss francs. Most Group companies use their local currency as their functional
currency. Certain Group companies use other currencies (such as US dollar, Swiss franc or euro) as their functional currency where
this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Local transactions in other currencies are initially
reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses from the settlement of such transactions and gains
and losses on translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are included in income, except when they
are qualifying cash flow hedges or arise on monetary items that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign entity.
In such cases the gains and losses are deferred into other comprehensive income.
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using functional currencies other than Swiss francs are translated into
Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange. The income statement and statement of cash flows are translated at the average rates
of exchange for the year. Translation differences due to the changes in exchange rates between the beginning and the end of the year
and the difference between net income translated at the average and year-end exchange rates are taken directly to other comprehensive
income.
Revenue
Sales. Revenue from the sale of goods supplied (product sales) and services rendered are recoded as ‘Sales’.
Sales are recognised when a promise in a customer contract (performance obligation) has been satisfied by transferring control over
the promised goods and services to the customer. Control over a promised good or service refers to the ability to direct the use of, and
obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, those goods or services. Control is usually transferred upon shipment, delivery
to, upon receipt of goods by the customer, or as services are rendered, in accordance with the delivery and acceptance terms agreed
with the customers. For goods subject to installation, such as instruments sold in the Diagnostics Division, sales are generally recognised
upon completion of the installation at the customer’s site and customer acceptance. The amount of sales to be recognised (transaction
price) is based on the consideration the Group expects to receive in exchange for its goods and services, excluding amounts collected on
behalf of third parties such as value added taxes or other taxes directly linked to sales. If a contract contains more than one performance
obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on their relative stand-alone selling prices.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 127Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Instruments in the Diagnostics Division may be sold together with other goods such as reagents and other consumables as well as
services under a single contract or under several contracts that are combined for revenue recognition purposes. Sales are recognised
upon satisfaction of each of the performance obligations in the contract. Instruments are either sold in cash and instalment sales
transactions or otherwise made available to customers under finance lease and operating lease transactions.
• Finance leases: Arrangements in which the Group transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the customer
are treated as finance lease arrangements. Sales from finance leases are recognised at amounts that represent the fair value of the
instrument, which approximates the present value of the minimum lease payments under the arrangement. As interest rates embedded
in finance lease arrangements are approximately market rates, sales from finance leases are comparable to revenue for outright sales.
Finance income for finance lease arrangements longer than twelve months is deferred and subsequently recognised based on a pattern
that approximates the use of the effective interest rate method and recorded in royalty and other operating income.
• Operating leases: Sales from operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term or, when lease revenue is
entirely variable and subject to subsequent reagent sales, as the performance obligation to deliver reagents is satisfied.
Sales, net of discounts, are based on estimates regarding the related obligations, including their stand-alone selling prices or fair values.
It requires judgement to determine when different obligations are satisfied, including whether enforceable purchase commitments
for further obligations exist and when they arise.
For contracts with distributors, no sales are recognised when goods are physically transferred to the distributor under a consignment
arrangement, or if the distributor acts as an agent. In such cases, sales are recognised when control over the goods transfers to
the end-customer, and distributor’s commissions are presented within marketing and distribution. Commissions and similar payments
to distributors acting as principals are deducted from sales unless such payments are in exchange for a distinct service.
The consideration received by the Group in exchange for its goods and services may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration is only
recognised when it is considered highly probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur once the underlying uncertainty
related to variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The most common elements of variable consideration in the Pharmaceuticals
Division are listed below:
• Government and regulatory mandatory price reductions. These consist of mandatory price reductions. The major elements are 340B
Drug Discount Program, Medicaid and other plans in the US.
• Contractual price reductions. These include rebates and chargebacks that are the result of contractual agreements that are primarily
volume-based and performance-based.
• Cash discounts. These include credits offered to wholesalers for remitting payment on their purchases within contractually defined
incentive periods.
• Customer returns reserves. These are allowances established for expected product returns.
Revenues from product sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts and estimates
of product returns, all of which are established at the time of sale. All product sales allowances are based on estimates of the amounts
earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration historical experience, current contractual and
statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends such as competitive pricing and new product introductions, estimated
inventory levels, and the shelf life of products. If actual future results vary, these estimates need to be adjusted, with an effect on sales
and earnings in the period of the adjustment. Sales reductions that are expected to be withheld by the customer upon settlement,
such as contractual price reductions and cash discounts, are recorded in the balance sheet as a deduction from trade receivables.
Sales reductions that are separately payable to customers, governmental health authorities or healthcare regulatory authorities are
recorded in the balance sheet as accrued liabilities. Provisions for sales returns are recorded in the balance sheet as other provisions.
The Group recognises a deferred income (contract liability) if consideration has been received (or has become receivable) before the
Group transfers the promised goods or services to the customer. Deferred income mainly relates to remaining performance obligations
for goods free of charge under certain patient access or similar programmes, reagents and other consumables and services.
Remaining performance obligations in (partially) unsatisfied long-term contracts are either included in deferred income or are related
to amounts the Group expects to receive for goods and services that have not yet been transferred to customers under existing, non-
cancellable or otherwise enforceable contracts. These are mainly associated with contracts with minimum purchase commitments related
to reagents and consumables for previously sold instruments as well as monitoring and maintenance services. For contracts that have
an original duration of one year or less, the Group has elected the practical expedient to not disclose the transaction price for remaining
performance obligations at the end of each reporting period and at which point in time the Group expects to recognise these sales.
128 | Roche Finance Report 2018Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Royalty and other operating income. Royalty and other operating income includes royalty income, income from out-licensing
agreements and income from disposal of products and other items.
Royalty income earned through a licence is recognised as the underlying sales are recorded by the licensee.
Income from out-licensing agreements typically arises from the receipt of upfront, milestone and other similar payments from third
parties for granting a licence to product- or technology-related intellectual property (IP). Out-licensing agreements may be entered into
with no further obligation or may include commitments to conduct research, late-stage development, regulatory approval, co-marketing
or manufacturing. Licences granted are usually rights to use IP and are generally unique. Therefore the basis of allocating revenue
to performance obligations makes use of the residual approach. Upfront payments and other licensing fees are usually recognised
upon granting the licence unless some of the income shall be deferred for other performance obligations using the residual approach.
Such deferred income is released and recognised as revenue when other performance obligations are satisfied. Milestone payments
are typically received upon reaching a specific scientific milestone (development milestone) or upon achieving a certain annual sales
milestone (commercial milestone). Development milestone income is recognised at the point in time when it is highly probable that
the respective milestone event criteria is achieved, and the risk of revenue reversal is considered remote. Commercial milestone income
is accrued and recognised as revenue when it is highly probable that the annual sales milestone is reached during the period.
Payments received for the disposal of product and similar rights are recognised as revenue upon transfer of control over such rights.
To the extent that some of these payments relate to other performance obligations, a portion is deferred using the residual approach
and recognised as revenue when or as activities such as manufacturing or other services are rendered. Income from profit-sharing
arrangements with collaboration partners is recognised as underlying sales and cost of sales are recorded by the collaboration partners.
Also included is income from other services rendered which are usually not part of the Group’s primary business activities, to the extent
that such revenue is not recorded under ‘Sales’, and is recognised when control transfers and performance obligations are satisfied.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and related production overheads of goods sold and services rendered.
Royalties, alliance and collaboration expenses, including all collaboration profit-sharing arrangements are also reported as part of cost
of sales. Start-up costs between validation and the achievement of normal production capacity are expensed as incurred.
Research and development
Internal research and development activities are expensed as incurred for the following:
• Internal research costs incurred for the purpose of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.
• Internal development costs incurred for the application of research findings or other knowledge to plan and develop new products
for commercial production. The development projects undertaken by the Group are subject to technical, regulatory and other
uncertainties, such that, in the opinion of management, the criteria for capitalisation as intangible assets are not met prior to obtaining
marketing approval by the regulatory authorities in major markets.
• Post-marketing studies after regulatory approval, such as phase IV costs in the pharmaceuticals business, generally involve
safety surveillance and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives marketing approval to be sold. They may be required
by regulatory authorities or may be undertaken for safety or commercial reasons. The costs of such post-marketing studies are
not capitalised as intangible assets as, in the opinion of management, they do not generate separately identifiable incremental
future economic benefits that can be reliably measured.
Acquired in-process research and development resources obtained through in-licensing arrangements, business combinations or
separate asset purchases are capitalised as intangible assets. The acquired asset must be controlled by the Group, be separately
identifiable and expected to generate future economic benefits, even if uncertainty exists as to whether the research and development
will ultimately result in a marketable product. Consequently, upfront and milestone payments to third parties for pharmaceutical products
or compounds before regulatory marketing approval are recognised as intangible assets. Assets acquired through such arrangements
are measured on the basis set out in the ‘Intangible assets’ policy. Subsequent internal research and development costs incurred post-
acquisition are treated in the same way as other internal research and development costs. If research and development are embedded
in contracts for strategic alliances, the Group carefully assesses whether upfront or milestone payments constitute funding of research
and development work or acquisition of an asset.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 129Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits include wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, profit sharing and
bonuses, and non-monetary benefits for current employees. The costs are recognised within the operating results when the employee
has rendered the associated service. The Group recognises a liability for profit sharing and bonuses where contractually obliged or
where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Long-term employee benefits include long-service or sabbatical leave, long-service benefits and long-term disability benefits.
The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment. Any changes in the carrying value of other long-term
employee benefit liabilities are recognised within the operating results.
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever
an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. Termination costs are recognised at the earlier of when
the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of the benefits or when the Group recognises any related restructuring costs.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
For defined contribution plans the Group contributions are recognised within the operating results when the employee has rendered
the associated service. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future
payments is available.
For defined benefit plans the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair
value of the plan assets. All changes in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as they occur as follows:
Recognised in the income statement:
• Current service cost is charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results.
• Past service cost, including curtailment gains or losses, is recognised immediately in general and administration within the operating
results.
• Settlement gains or losses are recognised in general and administration within the operating results.
• Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is recognised in financing costs.
Recognised in other comprehensive income:
• Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments (the difference between previous assumptions and what has actually
occurred) and changes in actuarial assumptions.
• The return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability.
• Any change in the limit on the recognition of plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is comprised of interest income on plan assets, interest cost on the defined benefit
obligation and interest on the effect of the limit on the recognition of pension assets. The net interest is calculated using the same
discount rate that is used in calculating the defined benefit obligation, applied to the net defined liability at the start of the period,
taking into account any changes from contribution or benefit payments.
Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to use
the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan.
Equity compensation plans
The fair value of all equity compensation awards granted to employees is estimated at the grant date and recorded as an expense over
the vesting period. The expense is charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results. For equity-settled
plans, an increase in equity is recorded for this expense and any subsequent cash flows from exercises of vested awards are recorded
as changes in equity.
130 | Roche Finance Report 2018Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction, and include all costs directly attributable
to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
These include items such as costs of site preparation, installation and assembly costs, and professional fees. The net costs of testing
whether the asset is functioning properly, including validation costs, are also included in the initially recorded cost of construction.
Interest and other borrowing costs incurred with respect to qualifying assets are capitalised and included in the carrying value
of the assets. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis, except for land, which is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives of major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
Land improvements 40 years
Buildings 10–50 years
Machinery and equipment 4–15 years
Diagnostic instruments 3–5 years
Office equipment 3–6 years
Motor vehicles 5–8 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate components.
The estimated useful lives of the assets are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation charges are accelerated.
Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Leases
Where the Group is the lessee. Finance leases exist when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to
the Group. Finance leases are capitalised at the start of the lease at fair value, or the present value of the minimum lease payments, if lower.
The rental obligation, net of finance charges, is reported within debt. Finance lease assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease
term and its useful life. The interest element of the lease payment is charged against income over the lease term based on the effective
interest rate method. Operating leases exist when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group.
Payments made under operating leases are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where the Group is the lessor. Certain assets, mainly Diagnostics instruments, are leased to third party customers through both finance
and operating lease arrangements. Such transactions may be entered into in separate contracts or in combined contracts including
reagents and other consumables and services.
• Finance leases: Finance lease assets are reported as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Sales from
finance leases are recognised at amounts that represent the fair value of the instrument, which approximates the present value
of the minimum lease payments under the arrangement. Finance income for finance lease arrangements longer than twelve months is
deferred and subsequently recognised based on a pattern that approximates the use of the effective interest method and recorded
in royalty and other operating income.
• Operating leases: Sales from operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term or, when lease revenue
is entirely variable and subject to subsequent reagent sales, as the performance obligation for reagents are satisfied.
Sales, net of discounts, are based on estimates regarding the related obligations, including their stand-alone selling prices or fair values.
It requires judgement to determine when different obligations are satisfied, including whether enforceable purchase commitments for
further obligations exist and when they arise.
Mergers and acquisitions
Business combinations. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. At the date of the
acquisition the Group initially recognises the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling
interest in the acquired business. The consideration transferred is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. Where the Group
does not acquire 100% ownership of the acquired business, non-controlling interests are recorded either at fair value or as the proportion
of the fair value of the acquired net assets attributable to the non-controlling interest. Directly attributable acquisition-related costs
are expensed as incurred within general and administration expenses.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 131Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Asset acquisitions. Asset acquisitions are acquisitions of legal entities that do not qualify as business combinations. At the date of
the acquisition the Group initially recognises the individual identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The cost representing
the cash consideration paid at the date of the acquisition is allocated to the individual identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of
the acquisition. Subsequent consideration for performance-related development milestones is recognised as intangible assets when
the specific milestones have been achieved. Such transactions do not give rise to goodwill. Directly attributable acquisition-related
costs are expensed as incurred within general and administration expenses.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises in a business combination and is the excess of the consideration transferred to acquire the business over the underlying
fair value of the net identified assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually and upon the
occurrence of an indication of impairment.
Intangible assets
Purchased patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Assets that have been acquired
through a business combination are initially recorded at fair value. Once available for use, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-
line basis over their useful lives. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date. The estimated useful life is the
lower of the legal duration and the economic useful life. The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are regularly reviewed. Estimated
useful lives of major classes of amortisable intangible assets are as follows:
Product intangibles in use up to 20 years
Marketing intangibles in use up to 10 years
Technology intangibles in use up to 14 years
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
An impairment assessment is carried out when there is evidence that an asset may be impaired. In addition, intangible assets that
are not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. When the recoverable amount of an asset, being the higher of its fair
value less costs of disposal and its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value is reduced to its recoverable
amount. This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. Value in use is calculated using estimated cash flows,
generally over a five-year period, with extrapolating projections for subsequent years. These are discounted using an appropriate long-
term interest rate. When an impairment loss arises, the useful life of the asset is reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation/
amortisation charge is accelerated. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively
to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through
the income statement as an impairment reversal.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is assessed for impairment at each reporting date and is additionally tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is allocated to
cash-generating units and when the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, being the higher of its fair value less costs of
disposal or its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value of the goodwill is reduced to its recoverable amount.
This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. When an acquired business that is included within a cash-
generating unit permanently ceases to operate then it is treated as a disposal of that business. For separately identifiable goodwill that
was generated on the initial acquisition of that business and where all of the factors that made up that goodwill are entirely unrelated
to the continuing operations of the cash-generating unit, then the goodwill is deemed to have been disposed of and is fully impaired.
The impairment testing methodology is further described in Note 9.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods, work in process and intermediates
includes raw materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs and overheads based upon the normal capacity of production
facilities. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to
completion and selling expenses.

Receivables, including accounts receivable
Policy applicable from 1 January 2018. Receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful
accounts, trade discounts, cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances. A receivable represents a right to consideration
that is unconditional and excludes contract assets. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for expected credit losses over the
term of the receivables. These estimates are based on specific indicators, such as the ageing of customer balances, specific credit
circumstances and the Group’s historical loss rates for each category of customers, and adjusted for forward-looking macroeconomic
data. Expenses for doubtful trade receivables are recognised within marketing and distribution expenses. Trade discounts, cash
discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of the related sales,
using estimates based on existing contractual obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience.
Receivables are written off (either partly or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Where receivables have been
written off, the Group continues to engage in enforcement activities to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries are
made, these are recognised in profit or loss.
For trade and lease receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach prescribed by IFRS 9, which requires/permits the use of
the lifetime expected loss provision from initial recognition of the receivables. The Group measures an allowance for doubtful accounts
equal to the credit losses expected over the lifetime of the trade and lease receivables.
Policy applicable before 1 January 2018. Receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful
accounts, trade discounts, cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded where
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. These estimates are based on specific indicators,
such as the ageing of customer balances, specific credit circumstances and the Group’s historical experience, taking also into account
economic conditions. Expenses for doubtful trade receivables are recognised within marketing and distribution expenses. Trade
discounts, cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of
the related sales, using estimates based on existing contractual obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and time, call and current balances with banks and similar institutions. Such balances
are only reported as cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes
in their fair value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to an outflow of resources
that can be reliably estimated. In particular, restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan that has
either commenced implementation or has been announced. Provisions are recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to
arise and are discounted when the time value of money is material. A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation
will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability. Contingent
assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Fair values
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices or by the use of established valuation
techniques such as option pricing models and the discounted cash flow method if quoted prices in an active market are not available.
Financial instruments
Policy applicable from 1 January 2018. From 1 January 2018 the Group classifies its financial instruments in the following measurement
categories which are disclosed in Note 30: amortised cost; fair value through OCI; fair value through OCI – equity investments; or fair
value through profit or loss (including hedging instruments).
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 133Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The classification depends on the Group’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.
The Group reclassifies debt securities and financial assets at amortised cost when and only when its business model for managing
those assets changes.
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through
profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets
carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.
Amortised cost. Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of
principal and interest are measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment. A gain or loss on a debt security that is subsequently
measured at amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or
impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other financial income using the effective interest rate method. Assets
at amortised cost are mainly comprised of accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and time accounts over three months.
Fair value through other comprehensive income (fair value through OCI). These are financial assets that are held for collection
of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and
interest. Those are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value are recorded in other comprehensive
income, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses which
are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI
is reclassified from equity to profit or loss. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other financial income using
the effective interest rate method. Fair value through other comprehensive income assets are mainly comprised of money market
instruments and debt securities.
Equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (fair value through OCI). These are equity investments
in private biotechnology companies, which are kept as part of the Group’s strategic alliance efforts. These assets are subsequently
measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as other financial income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents
a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and included in the fair value reserve.
When such an asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified within equity from
the fair value reserve to retained earnings and never to profit or loss.
Fair value through profit or loss. These are financial assets whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis. A gain or loss on
a financial asset that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised
in profit or loss and presented within other financial income (expense) in the period in which it arises. Fair value through profit or loss
assets are mainly comprised of equity investments/securities. Contingent consideration liabilities are initially recorded and subsequently
carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in general and administration within the operating results of the income
statement.
Fair value through profit or loss – hedging instruments. These are derivative financial instruments that are used to manage the
exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. These instruments are initially recorded and subsequently
carried at fair value. Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, all changes in fair value
are recorded as other financial income (expense).
Policy applicable before 1 January 2018. Financial instruments were classified into the following categories which are disclosed
in Note 30: available-for-sale; fair value – hedging instruments; fair value – designated; loans and receivables.
Available-for-sale. These are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated as such or are not classified in any other
financial asset category. Available-for-sale assets are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Changes in fair value are
recorded in other comprehensive income, except for impairments and interest and foreign exchange components. When an investment
is derecognised, the cumulative gains and losses in equity are reclassified to other financial income (expense). Available-for-sale assets
are mainly comprised of marketable securities.
Fair value – hedging instruments. These are derivative financial instruments that are used to manage the exposures to foreign currency,
interest rate, equity market and credit risks. Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value.
Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, all changes in fair value are recorded as other
financial income (expense).
134 | Roche Finance Report 2018Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Fair value – designated. These are non-derivative financial instruments that are designated as fair value through profit or loss on initial
recognition. Designated fair value instruments are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value with changes in fair value
recorded in the income statement. Designated fair value instruments are mainly comprised of contingent consideration liabilities with
changes in fair value recorded in general and administration within the operating results.
Loans and receivables. These are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. Loans and receivables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest
rate method, less any impairment losses. Loans and receivables are mainly comprised of accounts receivable and cash and cash
equivalents.
No change in policies on 1 January 2018 for the following items:
Other financial liabilities. These are non-derivative financial liabilities. Other financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value,
less transaction costs, and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Other financial liabilities are
mainly comprised of debt and trade payables.
Debt. Debt instruments are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Subsequently they
are reported at amortised cost. Any discount between the net proceeds received and the principal value due on redemption is amortised
over the duration of the debt instrument and is recognised as part of financing costs using the effective interest rate method.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual cash flows from the asset expire or when the Group transfers the rights to
receive the contractual cash flows from the financial assets in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
of the financial asset are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when the contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or
expire.
Impairment of financial assets
Policy applicable from 1 January 2018. The Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) for financial assets
measured at amortised cost and debt securities measured at fair value through OCI.
For trade and lease receivables the Group measures the allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.
For debt securities carried at fair value through OCI and debt securities and other financial assets at amortised cost, which are
determined to have low credit risk based on external credit ratings of the counterparties, the Group measures loss allowances at an
amount equal to 12-month ECL. The Group considers debt securities to have low credit risk when their credit risk rating is equivalent
to the globally understood definition of ‘investment grade’. The Group considers this to be at least Baa3 from Moody’s and BBB- from
Standard & Poor’s. When the credit risk of debt securities carried at fair value through OCI and debt securities and other financial assets
at amortised cost has increased significantly since their initial recognition, the Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal
to lifetime ECL. The Group assumes that the credit risk of such instruments have increased significantly if they are more than 30 days
past due.
Financial assets are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when
the Group determines that the customer does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay
the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off are still subject to enforcement activities in order to
comply with the Group’s policy for recovery of amounts due.
Policy applicable before 1 January 2018. Financial assets are individually assessed for possible impairment at each reporting date.
An impairment charge is recorded where there is objective evidence of impairment, such as where the issuer is in bankruptcy, default
or other significant financial difficulty. Available-for-sale equity securities that have a market value of more than 25% below their original
cost, or have a market value below their original cost for a sustained six-month period will be considered as impaired.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, any impairment charge is the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable
amount, calculated using estimated future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate. For available-for-sale financial
assets, any impairment charge is the amount currently carried in other comprehensive income for the difference between the original
cost and the fair value.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 135Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
For debt securities measured at amortised cost or available-for-sale, the reversal is recognised in income. For equity securities held
as available-for-sale, the reversal is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Hedge accounting
The Group uses derivatives to manage its exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. The instruments
used may include interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, forwards contracts and options. The Group generally limits the use of
hedge accounting to certain significant transactions. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet several strict
conditions on eligibility of hedging and hedged instruments, formal designation and documentation, as well as hedge effectiveness and
reliability of measurement. While many of these transactions can be considered as hedges in economic terms, if the required conditions
are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item
are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship, which means that any derivatives are reported at fair value, with
changes in fair value included in other financial income (expense).
Cash flow hedge. This is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a
recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss. The hedging instrument is recorded
at fair value. The effective portion of the hedge is included in other comprehensive income and any ineffective portion is reported in
other financial income (expense). If the hedging relationship is the hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment or highly
probable forecasted transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the
hedging instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying value of the non-financial
item at the date of recognition. For all other cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that
have been recorded in other comprehensive income are included in other financial income (expense) when the forecasted transaction
affects net income.
Fair value hedge. This is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or an unrecognised firm
commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect
profit or loss. The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item is recorded at its previous carrying value, adjusted
for any changes in fair value that are attributable to the hedged risk. Changes in the fair values are reported in other financial income
(expense).
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding taxes payable on the distribution
of retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based on income, such as property and capital taxes, are included within general
and administration expenses.
Liabilities for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally relating to
subsidiaries, are only recognised where it is probable that such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future. Where the amount
of tax liabilities is uncertain, accruals are recorded within income tax liabilities for management’s best estimate of the ultimate liability
that is expected to arise based on the specific circumstances and the Group’s historical experience.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
carrying values. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the same taxation authority and when
there is a legally enforceable right to offset them. Deferred taxes are determined based on the currently enacted tax rates applicable
in each tax jurisdiction where the Group operates.
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The original purchase cost, consideration
received for subsequent resale of these equity instruments and other movements are reported as changes in equity. These instruments
are held for the Group’s potential conversion obligations that may arise from the Group’s equity compensation plans.

Changes in accounting policies
In 2018 the Group implemented the following new standards, including any consequential amendments to other standards, with a date
of initial application of 1 January 2018.
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
• ‘Definition of a Business’ (Amendments to IFRS 3)
The Group has also implemented various other minor amendments to existing standards and interpretations, which have no material
impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position.
None of the new standards, revised standards, amended standards or interpretations have a material impact on the Group’s overall results
and financial position. The nature and the effects of the changes most relevant to the Group’s financial statements are given below.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
Effective 1 January 2018 the Group has implemented IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’. The new standard replaces IAS 39 ‘Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. The standard deals with the classification, recognition and measurement (including
impairment) of financial instruments and also introduces a new hedge accounting model. The new standard results in an increased
volume of disclosure information in the Annual Financial Statements.
Classification and measurement of financial instruments. Previously all marketable securities were classified as available-for-sale
under IAS 39. Under the new standard, equity securities are classified as fair value through profit or loss, debt securities and money
market instruments as fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) and time accounts over three months as amortised cost.
The Group elected to classify certain strategic equity investments as fair value through OCI. When such strategic equity investments
are sold, the cumulative amount included in the fair value reserve is transferred to retained earnings.
Impairment of financial assets. On 1 January 2018 the Group changed the methodology of assessing impairment of its financial assets
from the incurred loss model (used in IAS 39) to the expected credit loss model (used in IFRS 9). In accordance with the transitional
provisions of IFRS 9, the Group has not restated prior periods but it has reassessed the impairment allowances under the new approach
as of 1 January 2018.
Hedge accounting. The new standard also introduces a new hedge accounting model which requires hedge accounting relationships
to be based upon the Group’s own risk management strategy and objectives and to be discontinued only when the relationships no longer
qualify for hedge accounting. The Group has applied the revised hedge accounting guidance to its hedging relationships prospectively
with effect from 1 January 2018. All hedge accounting relationships designated under the previous IAS 39 guidance have continued to be
valid hedge accounting relationships in accordance with IFRS 9.
Transition approach. The Group has applied the exemption from full retrospective application for the classification and measurement
requirements, including impairment, meaning that the comparative 2017 results have not been restated. Differences in the carrying
amounts of financial assets and reclassification adjustments from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognised in retained earnings and reserves
as at 1 January 2018. Accordingly, the information presented for 2017 does not generally reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 but rather
those of IAS 39.
Presentational changes. As a result of implementing IFRS 9, the Group has made a number of presentational changes to the statement
of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and to Notes 4, 13, 15 and 30.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 137Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Impact from the initial application of IFRS 9. The impact from the initial application of IFRS 9 on the Group’s consolidated balance

Total equity 29,007 (5) 29,002
There was a reclassification within equity of CHF 110 million, net of tax, transferred from fair value reserves to retained earnings
on 1 January 2018 which related to unrealised gains for equity instruments/investments due to their reclassification as fair value through
profit or loss (previously classified as available-for-sale). In addition, there was a decrease of CHF 5 million, net of tax, in retained
earnings due to additional bad debt allowance on trade and lease receivables resulting from applying the expected credit loss model
(used in IFRS 9).
The following table reconciles the carrying amounts of financial assets under IAS 39 to the carrying amounts under IFRS 9 on transition
to IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018. There were no reclassifications for financial liabilities.

IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’
Effective 1 January 2018 the Group has implemented IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’. The new standard replaces
IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction Contracts’. IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how
much and when revenue is recognised, and also contains new requirements related to presentation. The core principle in the framework
is that revenue should be recognised dependent on the transfer of promised goods or services to the customer for an amount that
reflects the consideration which should be received in exchange for those goods or services. The objective of the standard is to provide
a five-step approach to revenue recognition that includes identifying contracts with customers, identifying performance obligations,
determining transaction prices, allocating transaction prices to performance obligations, and recognising revenue when or as
performance obligations are satisfied. Judgement needs to be applied, including making estimates and assumptions, for multiple-element
contracts in identifying performance obligations, in constraining estimates of variable consideration and in allocating the transaction
price to each performance obligation and to lease components (if any), particularly in the Diagnostics business and for out-licensing
agreements. The new standard results in an increased volume of disclosure information in the Annual Financial Statements.
Changes introduced by the standard relevant to the Roche Group. The new standard provides additional requirements and guidance
that are relevant to the Group, notably on the following areas:
• Revenue from licences of intellectual property, including sales-based royalties, on constraining estimates of variable consideration
such as e.g. development milestones, and on providing a material right to receive additional goods free of charge under certain patient
access programmes that may be regarded as a separate performance obligation. There is no material impact from these changes.
• The new standard also clarifies how to allocate sales, including the treatment of discounts, to each element in multiple-elements
contracts and when to recognise sales for each of those elements. Such contracts are entered into in the Diagnostics Division and
typically include obligations for instruments (including those provided under leasing arrangements), reagents and other consumables,
and services. It requires the use of estimates and assumptions and some judgement to apply this guidance in practice. There is no
material impact from this guidance.
• Out-licensing agreements in the Pharmaceuticals Division may be entered into with no further obligation or may include commitments
to conduct research, late-stage development, regulatory approval, co-marketing or manufacturing. These may be settled by a combination
of up-front payments, milestone payments, other licensing fees, and reimbursements for services provided. Whether to consider
these commitments as a single performance obligation or separate ones, or even being in scope of IFRS 15, is not straightforward and
requires some judgement. Depending on the conclusion, this may result in all revenue being calculated at inception and either being
recognised at once or spread over the term of a longer performance obligation. The answers under the new standard may be different
from those currently used. The new standard provides an exemption for sales-based royalties for licences of intellectual property
which will continue to be recognised as revenue as underlying sales are incurred.
Transition approach and use of practical expedients. The Group has applied the full retrospective method for the transition.
Certain practical expedients permitted by the standard during the transition have also been used, notably:
• the relief to not restate contracts that began and were completed in 2017 or were completed before 1 January 2017; and
• the relief to not provide in 2018 the disclosure requirement as per IFRS 15 paragraph 120 for the comparative 2017 period
(‘amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations’).
Since the new standard, including the use of practical expedients, has not modified the timing or amounts of revenue recognised for 2017,
no restatement has been necessary.
Presentational changes. As a result of implementing IFRS 15, the Group has also made a presentational change to the income
statement to include a subtotal ‘Revenue’, and has created a new note for ‘Revenue’ as Note 3.
‘Definition of a Business’ (Amendments to IFRS 3)
In October 2018 the International Accounting Standards Board issued amendments to IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’. The amendments
further clarify the definition of a business and add an optional ‘concentration test’ to aid the assessment of whether a transaction
represents a business combination or is simply in substance the purchase of a single asset or group of similar assets. These amendments
are mandatory from 2020 and may be early adopted. The amendments are particularly relevant for many of the acquisitions carried out
by the Group, since the value in the acquired companies often largely consists of the rights to a single product or technology. Therefore,
effective 1 January 2018, the Group has early implemented these amendments, with prospective application and with no restatement
of comparative period information.
Roche Finance Report 2018 | 139Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 6 has been expanded and renamed as ‘Mergers and acquisitions’ to include both transactions accounted for as business
combinations and asset acquisitions. Asset acquisitions are acquisitions of legal entities that do not qualify as business combinations
under IFRS 3. Cash consideration paid for asset acquisitions at the transaction date and subsequent additional contingent payments
made upon the achievement of performance-related development milestones are now presented in the line ‘Asset acquisitions’ as
disclosed in Note 6. Subsequent consideration for performance-related development milestones for transactions treated as asset
acquisitions is recognised as intangible assets when the specific milestones have been achieved. Previously intangible assets acquired
in asset acquisitions were included in the line items ‘Purchase of intangible assets’ in the statement of cash flows and ‘Additions’ in
Note 10 ‘Intangible assets’.
Future new and revised standards
The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of the various new and revised standards and interpretations that will be
mandatory from 1 January 2019 which the Group has not yet applied. Based on the analysis to date, the Group does not anticipate that
these will have a material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position except for the effects from the implementation
of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ as summarised below.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
The Group will implement the new standard effective 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 will replace existing leases guidance, including IAS 17
‘Leases’, and sets out the principles for recognition and measurement of leases. The new standard will also result in an increased volume
of disclosure information in the Annual Financial Statements.
The main effect on the Group is that IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. It requires a
lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for almost all leases, including operating leases. The Group has assessed the potential impact
and expects the carrying value of leased assets to increase by approximately CHF 1.2 billion, with lease liabilities expected to increase
by a similar amount at the date of implementation. The application of the new standard will result in part of what are currently reported
as operating lease costs being recorded as interest expenses. Given the leases involved and the current low interest rate environment,
the Group does not currently expect this effect to be material. The Group is currently finalising the exact impact of the new standard.
Transition approach and use of practical expedients. The Group will apply the cumulative catch-up method for the transition.
Therefore the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 will be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at
1 January 2019, with no restatement of comparative information. Some practical expedients permitted by the standard will also be used,
notably to not reassess upon transition whether an existing contract contains a lease, and the recognition exemptions for short-term

Report of Roche Management on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate control over
financial reporting. The internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance over the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2018 based on
the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has concluded
that the system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 31 December 2018.
The Statutory Auditor KPMG AG has audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended
31 December 2018, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA). They have
also issued a report on the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control over financial reporting. This report is set out on
pages 150 to 151.

Statutory Auditor’s Report
To the General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise
the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2018 and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement
of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements (pages 40 to 140) give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial
position of the Group as at 31 December 2018, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for
the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and Swiss Auditing
Standards. Our responsibilities under those provisions and Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities
for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance
with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as the IESBA Code of Ethics
for Professional Accountants, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit
of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of
our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not
provide a separate opinion on these matters.

management. The assumptions required for estimating

Other Information in the Annual Report
The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information in the annual report. The other information comprises all
information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial
statements of the company, the remuneration report and our auditor’s reports thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information in the annual report and we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information in the
annual report and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that
fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibility of the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view
in accordance with IFRS and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
Swiss law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and
maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal control.
— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances.
— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made.
— Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or,
if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as
a going concern.
148 | Roche Finance Report 2018Statutory Auditor’s Report | Roche Group
— Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures,
and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation.
— Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction,
supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit.
We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and communicate to them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report
because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of
such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and the Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control
system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions
of the Board of Directors.
We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

Roche Finance Report 2018 | 149Roche Group | Independent Reasonable Assurance Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Independent Reasonable Assurance Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
To the Board of Directors of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
We were engaged by the Board of Directors to carry out a reasonable assurance engagement on the design, implementation
and operating effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting of the Roche Group as it was in place at
31 December 2018. Management of Roche Holding Ltd assessed the effectiveness of its system of internal control over
financial reporting as of 31 December 2018 based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described
in Internal Control – Integrated Framework 2013, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and Management
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as included in
the accompanying Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
An entity’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). An entity’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a material effect
on the entity’s financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our Responsibilities
Our responsibility is to examine the design, implementation and effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial
reporting and to report thereon in the form of an independent, reasonable assurance conclusion, based on the evidence
obtained. We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE)
3000 Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the International
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained, in all material respects.
The procedures selected depend on our judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the
design, implementation and effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our examination included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, testing and evaluating the design, implementation and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures, as we
considered necessary in the circumstances.
150 | Roche Finance Report 2018Independent Reasonable Assurance Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting | Roche Group
Our Independence and Quality Control
The firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality
control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards
and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants
issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity,
objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.
Conclusion
Our conclusion has been formed on the basis of, and is subject to, the matters outlined in this report.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.
In our opinion, the Roche Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
31 December 2018 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and International Standards on Auditing, the consolidated
financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended 31 December 2018 and our report dated 28 January 2019
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Alternative Performance Measures
The financial information included in the Financial Review includes certain Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) which are not
accounting measures as defined by IFRS, in particular the core results, net working capital, net operating assets, free cash flow and
constant exchange rates. These APMs should not be used instead of, or considered as alternatives to, the Group’s consolidated financial
results based on IFRS. These APMs may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies. All APMs
presented in the Financial Review relate to the performance of the current year and comparative periods.
Core results
Core results allow for an assessment of both the Group’s actual results as defined by IFRS and the underlying performance of
the business. The core results concept, which is used in the internal management of the business, is based on the IFRS results,
with the following adjustments:
• Global restructuring plans (see Note 7) are excluded.
• Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (see Note 10) and impairment of goodwill (see Note 9) are excluded.
• Acquisition accounting and other impacts from the accounting for merger and acquisition transactions and alliance arrangements
(see Financial Review) are excluded.
• Discontinued operations (currently none) are excluded.
• Legal and environmental cases (see Financial Review) are excluded.
• Global issues outside the healthcare sector beyond the Group’s control are excluded.
• Material treasury items such as major debt restructurings (currently none) are excluded.
• Pension plan settlements (see Note 26) are excluded.
• The tax benefit recorded under IFRS in respect of Equity Compensation Plans (ECPs), which varies according to the price of the
underlying equity, is replaced by a normalised tax benefit, being the IFRS 2 expense multiplied by the applicable tax rate (see Note 5).
The core results concept was further described on 22 October 2010 at an Investor Update teleconference, which is available for
download at: http://www.roche.com/investors/ir_agenda/csr_151010.htm
The Group’s IFRS results, including the divisional breakdown, are reconciled to the core results in the tables below. The calculation of
Core EPS is also given in the tables below. Additional commentary to the adjustment items is given in the Financial Review.

the Group’s ability to generate cash to finance dividend payments, repay debt and to undertake merger and acquisition activities.
The free cash flow concept is used in the internal management of the business.
Operating free cash flow is calculated based on the IFRS operating profit and adjusted for certain cash items, movements in net working
capital and capital expenditures (investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets). Operating free cash flow is different
from cash flows from operating activities as defined by IAS 7 in that it includes capital expenditures (which is within the responsibility of
divisional management) and excludes income taxes paid (which is not within the responsibility of divisional management). Cash outflows
from defined benefit plans are allocated to the operating free cash flow based on the current service cost with the residual allocated to
treasury activities.
Free cash flow is calculated as the operating free cash flow adjusted for treasury activities and taxes paid. Free cash flow is different
from total cash flows as defined by IAS 7 in that it excludes dividend payments, cash inflows/outflows from financing activities such
as issuance/repayment of debt, purchase/sale of marketable securities and cash inflows/outflows from mergers, acquisitions and
divestments.

EBITDA
The Group does not use Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) in either its internal management
reporting or its external communications. In the opinion of the Group’s management, operating free cash flow gives a more useful
and consistent measurement of ‘cash earnings’ than EBITDA, which includes many non-cash items such as provisions, allowances
for trade receivables and inventories, and certain non-cash entries arising from acquisition accounting and pension accounting.
For the convenience of those readers that do use EBITDA, this is provided in the table below. As the starting point this uses the core
results, which already exclude the amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.

Net operating assets
Net operating assets allow for an assessment of the Group’s operating performance of the business independently from financing and
tax activities. Net operating assets are calculated as property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, net working capital and
long-term net operating assets minus provisions.
The calculation of the net operating assets disclosed in Note 2 of the Annual Financial Statements is shown in the tables below.

Roche Finance Report 2018 | 161Roche Group | Multi-Year Overview and Supplementary Information
Net debt
Net debt is used to monitor the Group’s overall short- and long-term liquidity. Net debt is calculated as the sum of total debt (long-term
and short-term) less marketable securities, cash and cash equivalents.
Net debt calculations, including details of movements during the current year, are shown in the table on page 33 in the Financial Review.
Net working capital
Net working capital is used to assess the Group’s efficiency in utilising assets and short-term liquidity. Net trade working capital is
calculated as trade receivables and inventories minus trade payables. Net working capital is calculated as net trade working capital
adjusted for other receivables and other payables.
Net working capital and net trade working capital calculations are shown in the tables on page 20 (Pharmaceuticals Division), page 26
(Diagnostics Division) and page 28 (Corporate) in the Financial Review.
Constant exchange rates
Certain percentage changes in the Financial Review have been calculated using constant exchange rates (CER) which allow for
an assessment of the Group’s financial performance with the effects of exchange rate fluctuations eliminated. The percentage changes
at constant exchange rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the current reported period and the prior period
numbers at constant currency exchange rates, equalling the average exchange rates for the prior year. For example, a CER change
between a 2018 line item and its 2017 equivalent is calculated using the average exchange rate for the year ended 31 December 2017 for
both the 2018 line item and the 2017 line item and subsequently calculating the change in percent with respect to the two recalculated
numbers.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are excluded from the calculation of CER growth rates in the earnings per share disclosures.
In countries where there is a significant devaluation in the local currency in the current year, the simulations use the average exchange
rate of the current year instead of the prior year to avoid that CER growth rates are artificially inflated.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel (the ‘Company’) have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of
Swiss Law on Accounting and Financial Reporting (32nd title of the Swiss Code of Obligations, ‘CO’). Where not prescribed by law,
the significant accounting principles applied are described below.
The Company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with a recognised accounting standard (International
Financial Reporting Standards). In accordance with the CO, the Company decided to forgo presenting additional information on audit fees
in the notes as well as a cash flow statement.
Valuation methods and translation of foreign currencies
Marketable securities are reported at the lower of cost or market value. All other financial assets, including investments, are reported at
cost less appropriate write-downs. Own equity instruments are recognised at cost and deducted from equity at the time of purchase.
If the own equity instruments are sold, the gain or loss is recognised through the income statement. Assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange, except investments which are translated at
historical rates. Transactions during the year which are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates effective
at the relevant transaction dates. Resulting exchange gains and losses are recognised in the income statement with the exception of
unrealised gains which are deferred.
Investments
The direct and indirect investments of the Company are listed in Note 32 to the Roche Group Annual Financial Statements. This listing
excludes Chugai’s subsidiaries as well as not material companies, notably companies that are inactive, dormant or in liquidation.
Ownership interests equal voting rights.
Taxes
Direct taxes include corporate income and capital taxes.
2. Shareholders’ equity
Share capital
As in the previous year, share capital amounts to CHF 160 million. The share capital consists of 160,000,000 bearer shares with a nominal
value of CHF 1.00 each. Included in equity are 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine). They are not part of the share
capital and confer no voting rights. However, each non-voting equity security confers the same rights as any of the shares to participate
in the available earnings and in any remaining proceeds from liquidation following repayment of the nominal value of the share capital and,
if any, participation certificates.
168 | Roche Finance Report 2018Notes to the Financial Statements | Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
Own equity instruments
At 31 December 2018 the Company did not hold any Roche shares or non-voting equity securities (2017: none). During 2018 and 2017
the Company neither purchased nor sold Roche shares or non-voting equity securities.
Company’s subsidiaries that meet the definitions and requirements of Article 659b CO do not hold equity instruments. Within the
Roche Group Annual Financial Statements some entities (mainly foundations) are included in the consolidation which do not qualify
as subsidiaries under Article 659b CO.

Roche Finance Report 2018 | 173Roche Holding Ltd, Basel | Statutory Auditor’s Report
Statutory Auditor’s Report
To the General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2018,
the income statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant
accounting policies.
In our opinion the financial statements (pages 165 to 173) for the year ended 31 December 2018 comply with Swiss law
and the company’s articles of incorporation.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those
provisions and Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
section of our report. We are independent of the entity in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements
of the Swiss audit profession and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Report on Key Audit Matters based on the circular 1/2015 of the Federal Audit Oversight Authority
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial
statements of the current period. We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report.
Responsibility of the Board of Directors for the Financial Statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of
Swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the entity’s ability to continue as
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but
to do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing
Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions
of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
174 | Roche Finance Report 2018Statutory Auditor’s Report | Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and
maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.
— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control.
— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made.
— C onclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern.
We communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit.
We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably
be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that
were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and the Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control
system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board
of Directors.
We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the company’s articles
of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

CER (Constant Exchange Rates): The percentage changes at constant exchange rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the 2020 and 2019 results at
constant exchange rates (the average rates for the year ended 31 December 2019). For the definition of CER see page 176.
Core results and Core EPS (earnings per share): These exclude non-core items such as global restructuring plans and amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible
assets. This allows an assessment of both the actual results and the underlying performance of the business. A full income statement for the Group and the operating results
of the divisions are shown on both an IFRS and core basis. The core concept is fully described on pages 168–171 and reconciliations between the IFRS and core results are
given there.
Free cash flow is used to assess the Group’s ability to generate the cash required to conduct and maintain its operations. It also indicates the Group’s ability to generate cash
to finance dividend payments, repay debt and to undertake merger and acquisition activities. The free cash flow concept is used in the internal management of the business.

Finance – 2020 in Brief
Roche in 2020
The Roche Group reported solid overall results in 2020, with the underlying business showing resilience in the pandemic environment.
Sales grew by 1% at constant exchange rates (CER). IFRS net income increased by 17% (CER) and core earnings per share increased
by 4% (CER). The appreciation of the Swiss franc against almost all currencies had an adverse impact on the results expressed in
Swiss francs.
Sales
Group sales increased by 1% (CER) to CHF 58.3 billion (5% decline in CHF terms). Pharmaceuticals sales declined by 2% (CER)
mainly due to the impact of biosimilars, notably in the US, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic leading to reduced hospitalisations
and outpatient visits. The growth in new medicines, led by Tecentriq, Hemlibra, Ocrevus, Perjeta and Kadcyla, and additional sales
of Actemra/RoActemra, partly compensated for these declines. Diagnostics sales showed growth of 14% (CER), due to sales of
COVID-19-related tests, notably the cobas SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test, which more than offset a
decline in routine testing across the portfolio.
Operating results
Core operating profit increased by 4% (CER) to CHF 21.5 billion (4% decline in CHF terms). Research and development expenditure
grew by 8% (CER) to CHF 12.2 billion on a core basis, despite the pandemic environment, with the focus on the oncology, neuroscience
and immunology therapeutic areas. Research and development costs represented 20.8% of Group sales. IFRS operating results
included non-core expenses (pre-tax) of CHF 3.0 billion. The major factors were CHF 1.8 billion amortisation charges for intangible
assets, CHF 0.9 billion restructuring costs and CHF 0.7 billion impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. The release of litigation
provisions resulted in an income of CHF 0.4 billion.
Non-operating results
Financing costs (IFRS) decreased by 41% at CER to CHF 0.6 billion due to early debt redemption losses of CHF 0.2 billion in 2019 and
lower interest expenses in 2020. Income tax expenses (IFRS) increased by 26% at CER to CHF 2.9 billion. The effective core tax rate
for 2020 increased to 17.1% mainly due to the impacts from the resolution of several tax disputes.
Net income
IFRS net income increased by 17% at CER to CHF 15.1 billion (+7% in CHF terms) driven by the operating results. Core earnings per share
increased by 4% at CER to CHF 19.16 (–5% in CHF terms).
Cash flows
Operating free cash flow was CHF 14.8 billion, a decrease of 21% at CER. The underlying cash generation remained strong, with
the decrease in CER arising from increases in net working capital and higher investments in in-licensing and alliance arrangements.
Free cash flow decreased by 26% at CER (–35% in CHF terms) to CHF 10.9 billion, driven by the lower operating free cash flow.
Financial position
Net working capital increased by 43% (CER) driven by increases in inventories in both divisions. Net debt decreased by CHF 0.6 billion
to CHF 1.9 billion. The free cash flow was offset by dividends paid and outflows on transactions in own equity instruments. Gross debt
increased by 6% (CER) to CHF 14.2 billion. Credit ratings remained strong: Moody’s at Aa3 and Standard & Poor’s at AA.
Shareholder return
A proposal will be made to increase dividends by 1% to CHF 9.10 per share. This would represent the 34th consecutive year of
dividend growth and would result in a pay-out ratio of 47.5%, subject to AGM approval. Total Shareholder Return (TSR) was 2%
representing the combined performance of share and non-voting equity security.2 Roche Group Finance Report 2020

The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has posed an unprecedented challenge for healthcare systems across the globe.
The Roche Group has responded to this challenge with both its pharmaceuticals and diagnostics businesses. In March 2020
the Diagnostics Division launched its cobas SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. This runs on the high-volume fully automated cobas 6800
and cobas 8800 systems based on PCR technology, which are installed in major hospitals and laboratories around the world.
Roche Diagnostics has also continued to complement its portfolio with point-of-care tests, such as the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid
Antigen test. In the Pharmaceuticals Division, Actemra/RoActemra has been adopted by many countries in their treatment
guidelines to treat patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and in August 2020, the Roche Group announced that it is
partnering with Regeneron to develop, manufacture and distribute its investigational neutralising antibody combination.
The Roche Group’s business has so far proved to be largely resilient in this difficult environment. The pandemic has nevertheless
had a negative impact on the underlying business of both of the Roche Group’s divisions, with the various restrictions leading
to reduced hospitalisations and outpatient visits, which has impacted routine diagnostics testing and has led to lower levels of
prescriptions for many medicines, notably those that require a medical professional to make infusions or injections. At the same
time, no major manufacturing supply chain issues have so far occurred and the Group’s planned drug launches, filings, pivotal
phase III trial readouts and pivotal trial starts are largely on track. Indeed, despite the pandemic, the Roche Group’s research
and development spending increased by 8%, and additionally various in-licensing transactions and asset acquisitions led to
additions to intangible assets of CHF 3.9 billion in the Pharmaceuticals Division and CHF 0.4 billion in the Diagnostics Division.
In 2020 the Roche Group reported sales growth of 1% at constant exchange rates (CER) and core operating profit growth of
4%. IFRS net income increased by 17% due to the prior period including significant goodwill write-offs, while Core EPS increased
by 4%. The appreciation of the Swiss franc against almost all currencies had an adverse impact on the results expressed in
Swiss francs compared to constant exchange rates of 6 percentage points on sales, 8 percentage points on core operating
profit and 9 percentage points on Core EPS. In the Pharmaceuticals Division, sales were 2% lower due to biosimilar erosion, which
was especially pronounced in the US, and COVID-19 effects. The global uptake of new medicines continued to be strong and
partly compensated for these effects. In the Diagnostics Division, sales of COVID-19-related tests totalled CHF 2.6 billion and
drove the 14% increase in divisional sales, which more than offset a decline in routine testing across the portfolio.4 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2020
Operating free cash flow was CHF 14.8 billion, a decrease of 21% at CER driven by increased net working capital and higher
investments in in-licensing and alliance arrangements. Free cash flow at CHF 10.9 billion was lower for the same reasons.
The appreciation of the Swiss franc had a significant negative impact on the free cash flows measures expressed in CHF terms.
The Group has maintained sufficient liquidity to support its ongoing business activities and is well positioned to meet its
financial obligations.

To some extent the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected sales across the whole business as described in the following section
on ‘Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic’. In 2020 sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division were CHF 44.5 billion (2019: CHF 48.5 billion),
a decrease of 2% at CER, which was driven by biosimilar competition, notably in the US, and the pandemic due to reduced
hospitalisations and outpatient visits. The growth in new products and additional sales of Actemra/RoActemra, which grew by
32%, partly compensated for these declines. New products were a major growth driver, with Tecentriq, Hemlibra, Ocrevus,
Perjeta and Kadcyla together contributing an additional CHF 3.9 billion (CER) of new sales. Tecentriq sales were 55% higher
at CHF 2.7 billion, with growth in all regions. The launch and rollout of Hemlibra continued with sales reaching CHF 2.2 billion.
Sales of Ocrevus were 24% higher at CHF 4.3 billion. Perjeta sales were CHF 3.9 billion, an increase of 18%, mostly due to
growth in China. Kadcyla sales grew by 34% mainly due to higher demand in both the US and Europe. In the US, the first biosimilar
versions of Herceptin, Avastin and MabThera/Rituxan entered the market in the second half of 2019 and US sales of these
three products were CHF 3.8 billion (CER) lower in 2020. In Europe, the first biosimilar versions of Avastin came to market from
mid-2020 and were a significant factor in the sales decline for Avastin in the second half of 2020.
The Diagnostics Division reported sales of CHF 13.8 billion, an increase of 14% at CER. The sales of the various COVID-19-related
tests in 2020 was CHF 2.6 billion (CER). Excluding these, there was a decline in routine testing across the portfolio during
the various restrictions in 2020. The major growth area was Molecular Diagnostics, which grew by 90%, driven by the cobas
SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Centralised and Point of Care Solutions sales decreased by 1%, which was attributable to a reduction
in routine testing volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by sales of the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test.
Diabetes Care sales decreased by 5% due to the continued overall contraction of the blood glucose monitoring market as
well as COVID-19 effects.Finance Report 2020 Financial Review | Roche Group 5
The Pharmaceuticals Division’s core operating profit remained stable at CER, while sales declined by 2%. Royalty and other
operating income decreased by CHF 0.2 billion due to lower product disposal gains than in the comparative period. Cost of
sales decreased by 16% due to lower inventory write-offs, product mix factors, productivity improvements and lower
collaboration and profit-sharing expenses. Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 8% and included activities to support
ongoing product launches and rollouts, notably Tecentriq, Ocrevus and Perjeta. The cost decrease was due to reduced
spending in marketing activities partly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lower personnel expenses. Research
and development costs grew by 8%, with the oncology franchise remaining the primary area of activity, and the growth in
spending being mostly driven by late-stage investments in ophthalmology, personalised healthcare and neuroscience. In 2020
there were also significant in-licensing transactions and asset acquisitions to bring external innovation into the Roche Group
resulting in intangible assets additions of CHF 3.9 billion in the Pharmaceuticals Division.
In the Diagnostics Division, core operating profit increased by 50% at CER, ahead of the sales growth of 14%. Cost of sales
grew by 10% due to the additional product volume and higher shipping rates. Marketing and distribution costs were stable as
lower spending resulting from COVID-19 restrictions and cost containment measures was offset by higher personnel expenses
and inventory write-offs. Research and development costs increased by 10% due to increased spending in COVID-19 products
development, projects in cardiac disease and digital solutions.
The IFRS operating profit increased by 4% (CER) in the Pharmaceuticals Division and included CHF 0.4 billion of income
following the release of various litigation provisions. The IFRS operating profit increased by CHF 1.8 billion in the Diagnostics
Division, with prior-year figures including goodwill impairment charges of CHF 0.8 billion relating to the Diabetes Care business.
The 2020 results include CHF 2.4 billion for the amortisation and impairment of intangible assets and CHF 0.9 billion of
expenses from global restructuring plans.
Operating free cash flow was CHF 14.8 billion, a decrease of 21% at CER due to an increase in net working capital and higher
investments in in-licensing and alliance arrangements. The developments in sales in 2020 had a negative impact on the
operating free cash flow in the Pharmaceuticals Division, while the Diagnostics Division saw an improvement in cash generation.
The free cash flow was CHF 10.9 billion, a decrease of 26% at CER. This was due to the lower operating free cash flow. When
expressed in CHF terms, the free cash flows measures show a strong negative impact from the appreciation of the Swiss franc.
Financing costs decreased by 41% (CER) on an IFRS basis at CHF 0.6 billion due to early debt redemption losses of
CHF 0.2 billion in 2019 and lower interest expenses in the current year attributable to the early repayment of debt in the second
half of 2019. The Group’s effective core tax rate increased to 17.1% compared to 16.3% in 2019. This was mainly due to the
impact from the resolution of several tax disputes which reduced the Group’s effective core tax rate by 1.5 percentage points
in 2020 and 2.1 percentage points in 2019.
Net income increased by 17% at CER on an IFRS basis to CHF 15.1 billion and by 5% on a core basis to CHF 17.4 billion, driven in
both cases by the operating results. The amount of net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased by 29% on an
IFRS basis and by 27% on a core basis, due to the increased contribution of Chugai to the overall Group results.6 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2020

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
Roche medicines and diagnostic tests
Tests that detect the virus. In March 2020 the cobas SARS-CoV-2 PCR test to detect an active infection with SARS-CoV-2
received US FDA Emergency Use Authorization and became available in markets accepting the CE mark. Hospitals and
reference laboratories can run the test on Roche Diagnostics’ high-volume fully automated cobas 6800 and cobas 8800
systems based on PCR technology, which are installed in major hospitals and laboratories around the world.
In September 2020 the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test for use in point-of-care settings for both symptomatic and asymptomatic
people was launched in markets accepting the CE mark. This test can help healthcare professionals identify a SARS-CoV-2
infection in people suspected to carry the virus with results typically ready in 15 minutes. In addition, it serves as a valuable initial
screening test for individuals that have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients or a high-risk environment.
In September 2020 the cobas SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B test for use on the cobas 6800/8800 systems received US FDA
Emergency Use Authorization and became available in markets accepting the CE mark. This test is also available on the
cobas Liat systems in the point-of-care setting. In December 2020 the high-throughput Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen test,
an automated laboratory assay intended as an aid in the diagnosis of active SARS-CoV-2 infection, was launched in markets
accepting the CE mark and a filing was also made for US FDA Emergency Use Authorization.
Tests that detect immune response. In May 2020 the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody test received US FDA Emergency
Use Authorization and became available in markets accepting the CE mark. The test is designed to help determine if a patient
has developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 after exposure to the virus. The tests can be run on Roche Diagnostics’ cobas e
analysers, which are widely available around the world.
In September 2020 the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody test was launched in markets accepting the CE mark, and
US FDA Emergency Use Authorization was subsequently received. This immunology test, which targets antibodies against
the spike protein, can be used to quantitatively measure antibodies in people who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and
can play an important part in characterising a vaccine-induced immune response.
The 2020 sales of the various COVID-19-related tests was CHF 2.6 billion (CER). Sales of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests,
combined with other COVID-19-related tests in Molecular Diagnostics, were CHF 2.1 billion (CER). The launch of the SARS-CoV-2
Rapid Antigen test in late September combined with other related tests in Centralised and Point of Care Solutions reached
CHF 0.5 billion (CER).
Investigating treatment options. Actemra/RoActemra has been adopted by many countries in their treatment guidelines
to treat patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Since March 2020 the Pharmaceuticals Division has initiated three global
phase III clinical trials investigating the safety and efficacy of Actemra/RoActemra (tocilizumab) in COVID-19-associated
pneumonia. Results of the COVACTA and EMPACTA studies have been published or submitted for publication in a p eer-reviewed
journal and have been uploaded on data sharing platforms. Following initial interactions with health authorities, the
Pharmaceuticals Division will continue to monitor the evolving clinical evidence for Actemra/RoActemra in this setting, including
in combination with an antiviral (remdesivir), in the ongoing phase III REMDACTA study. In addition to these trials, there are
other independently led clinical trials on multiple medicines including Actemra/RoActemra that are taking place around the
world such as the REMAP-CAP and the RECOVERY trials in the UK. At the time of writing, Actemra/RoActemra is not approved
in the clinical treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Sales of Actemra/RoActemra in 2020 were CHF 2.9 billion, an increase of
32% compared to an increase of 8% in 2019.
Partnerships and collaborations. In August 2020, the Group announced that it is partnering with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (‘Regeneron’) to develop, manufacture and distribute casirivimab and imdevimab, an investigational neutralising antibody
combination. In addition to being investigated in non-hospitalised patients, casirivimab and imdevimab are currently being
studied in a phase II/III clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalised patients, the phase III open-label RECOVERY
trial of hospitalised patients in the UK, and a phase III trial for the prevention of COVID-19 in household contacts of infected
individuals. Under the terms of the agreement, Regeneron will distribute casirivimab and imdevimab in the US and the
Roche Group will be responsible for distribution outside the US. In November 2020 Regeneron announced that its antibody
combination had received Emergency Use Authorization in the US.8 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2020
In October 2020, the Group announced that it is also partnering with Atea Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (‘Atea’) to develop, manufacture
and distribute AT-527, an investigational novel oral antiviral. A phase II study for the treatment of hospitalised patients with
moderate COVID-19 is ongoing and a phase II in the outpatient setting has started in January 2021. In addition, AT-527 may be
developed for post-exposure prophylactic settings.
In December 2020, the Group announced a partnership with Moderna, Inc. (‘Moderna’) to utilise the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S
antibody test in Moderna’s mRNA-1273 vaccine research trials. This will facilitate the quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV-2
antibodies and help to establish a correlation between vaccine-induced protection and levels of anti-receptor binding domain
(RBD) antibodies.
Impact on the Roche Group’s business and results
Revenues. The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the Group’s revenues, both on the absolute amounts and in the phasing
during 2020. The following factors affected sales across the whole portfolio in the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics
businesses, although the impact varied by product and by geography:
• The restrictions on local travel and public gatherings discouraged some patients from visiting physicians, health practices
and hospitals. This especially affected elderly patients.
• Many hospitals and health practices experienced a certain level of disruption leading to delays or cancellations of patient
visits, especially for non-critical procedures.
• There was a certain level of forward purchasing in the first quarter of 2020 as doctors wrote prescriptions for longer
periods to minimise patient visits to pharmacies, and as patients and distributors stocked up in anticipation of restrictions
and potential supply chain disruptions.
These factors manifested in a higher level of sales prior to restrictions being imposed, followed by a lower level of sales
during the second quarter of 2020 and then a slow recovery beginning at the end of the second quarter as restrictions
were progressively eased in certain countries. This recovery continued through the third quarter of the year, however the
reimposition of restrictions in many countries in the fourth quarter had a negative effect on the recovery.

In the Pharmaceuticals Division the overall impact of COVID-19 was negative, with the various restrictions leading to reduced
hospitalisations and outpatient visits, which has impacted routine diagnostic testing and has led to lower levels of prescriptions
for many medicines. This was partly compensated by additional sales of Actemra/RoActemra (+32%). The negative impacts were
strongest for medicines where regular visits to health practices or hospitals are needed, for example for infusions or injections.
Sales of Lucentis in the US (–16%), Ocrevus (+24%) and the oncology portfolio (–10%) were therefore particularly affected,
although the oncology portfolio was also heavily impacted by biosimilar erosion. The ongoing rollouts of Tecentriq (+55%) and
Hemlibra (+68%) continued strongly, although the uptake of Hemlibra was also impacted to some extent by the pandemic.
In the Diagnostics Division the pandemic had a negative impact on sales across the whole portfolio, but this was more than
compensated for by sales of the COVID-19-related tests, notably the cobas SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and the SARS-CoV-2
Rapid Antigen test. The pandemic led to a reduction in overall diagnostic testing, which translated into reduced instrument
placements in the laboratory solutions business and reduced sales of reagents and consumables. The delivery of
COVID-19-related tests led to a certain build-up in inventories as at 31 December 2020, notably the recently launched
SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test. The sales of the various COVID-19-related tests in 2020 was CHF 2.6 billion (CER).
Manufacturing and supply. Despite some of the supply and logistics challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Roche
Group has been able to continue to deliver medicines and diagnostics wherever possible for patients across a broad range
of other disease areas under exceptional conditions. To date there has been limited disruption and the Group is continually
monitoring the situation. While a certain level of volatility in purchasing patterns was noted during 2020, this has not
significantly impacted the supply chain.Finance Report 2020 Financial Review | Roche Group 9
With the announcement of new clinical trials, and a potential increase in demand for Actemra/RoActemra, the Pharmaceuticals
Division has ramped up its manufacturing capacity to increase the globally available supply. Manufacturing investments were also
made in relation to the partnership with Regeneron. In total the additional capital expenditure related to the COVID-19-related
projects in the Pharmaceuticals Division was CHF 90 million. While the Roche Group is ensuring a coordinated, global overview
of additional supply requests, provision of medicines is managed on a country level according to local rules and regulations and
in close collaboration with the authorities.
The Diagnostics Division has ramped up production capacity and supply chain for all COVID-19-related testing products
with further scale-up as fast as possible. The additional capital expenditure in the Diagnostics Division was CHF 137 million.
The Roche Group is committed to delivering as many tests as possible within the limits of supply and delivering its tests to
areas where they can be immediately effective. Tests will be shipped from production sites to locations where appropriate
infrastructure is in place and testing can begin without delay.
Research and development. The Roche Group’s planned drug launches, filings, pivotal phase III trial readouts and pivotal
trial starts are largely on track. The Group is continuously monitoring all ongoing studies, both in terms of missed doses and
overall data integrity. The Group’s development teams are taking significant efforts to protect these studies with continued
support from health authorities, but the ultimate impact will also depend on the length and severity of the pandemic. Should
the pandemic have a prolonged duration then the launch of new clinical trials and the progress of ongoing clinical trials may
be delayed by restrictions at medical facilities and by patients deferring visits or simply not volunteering.
Operating results. The major impact on the operating profit came from the above-mentioned factors for revenues. Overall
operating expenses were impacted to some extent by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the various impacts were partly offsetting.
While some additional costs were incurred for areas such as IT infrastructure and distribution costs, there was less spending
on travel and congresses. In particular, the 6% decline in marketing and distribution costs was driven by a general slowdown in
marketing activities, including lower travel costs and reduced attendance at congresses. There were no significant costs for
idle manufacturing capacity or inventory write-offs that could be attributed directly to the pandemic, and construction projects
incurred only minor costs for delays during restrictions.
Core results. The Group has not made any changes to its core results concept as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The specific COVID-19-related impacts referred to above are included in both the IFRS and core results. It should be noted
that the core results exclude non-core items such as global restructuring plans and amortisation and impairment of goodwill
and intangible assets, regardless of the cause.
Liquidity and financial position
The liquidity and financial position of the Roche Group remained sound during this exceptional period.
Liquidity. The Group continues to show strong cash generation ability with free cash flow of CHF 10.9 billion. The 26% decrease
at CER in free cash flow compared to 2019 was partly due to investments in in-licensing and alliance arrangements, which
resulted in a cash outflow of CHF 3.6 billion. Roche continues to enjoy strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA
by Standard & Poor’s and Aa3 by Moody’s. The Group has committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling
USD 7.5 billion available as back-stop lines for the commercial paper program. As at 31 December 2020 no debt has been drawn
under these credit lines. The Group did not renegotiate any major contracts for liquidity reasons. The Group did not observe a
significant increase in credit risk in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bad debt expenses and overdue receivables remained
at relatively low levels.
Financial position as at 31 December 2020. As described previously, there were no significant bad debts or write-offs of
inventories that could be directly attributed to COVID-19 factors. Intangible asset impairment charges of CHF 0.3 billion
were incurred as a result of a delay in clinical trials, partly caused by COVID-19, for the Spark Therapeutics’ haemophilia A
programme. No other impairment issues were noted for goodwill and intangible assets that can be directly attributed to the
pandemic.
No impairment issues that can be directly attributed to the pandemic were noted for financial assets, although the volatility
in global markets had a corresponding impact on the carrying value of investments held at fair value. Similarly, there was a
certain volatility in the fair value of pension assets and discount rates during the first half of 2020, but the situation had largely
stabilised by the end of the year, and no exceptional funding payments to the Group’s pension plans are currently foreseen.10 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2020
Group results (continued)
Mergers and acquisitions
Spark Therapeutics. On 17 December 2019 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Spark Therapeutics, Inc.
(‘Spark Therapeutics’), a publicly owned US company based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that had been listed on Nasdaq Stock
Market. Spark Therapeutics is a fully integrated commercial company committed to discovering, developing and delivering gene
therapies. Spark Therapeutics is reported in the Pharmaceuticals Division. The cash purchase consideration was USD 4.8 billion
(equivalent to CHF 4.7 billion). In the 2019 Annual Financial Statements, the allocation of the purchase price recorded in the
balance sheet was provisional. During the first half of 2020 the identification and valuation of intangible assets and other assets
and liabilities was completed. Accordingly, the provisional amounts recorded in the balance sheet at 31 December 2019 were
restated as set out in Note 6 to the Annual Financial Statements. As a result, the values for intangible assets were increased by
CHF 2.4 billion, deferred tax assets by CHF 0.3 billion and deferred tax liabilities by CHF 0.5 billion, with a consequent decrease
in goodwill of CHF 2.2 billion.
Asset acquisitions. In 2020 Roche Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Promedior, Inc. (‘Promedior’), Inflazome
Ltd. (‘Inflazome’), TMEM16A Ltd. (‘TMEM16A’), and Lexent Bio, Inc. (‘Lexent Bio’) for the Pharmaceuticals Division and Stratos
Genomics, Inc. (‘Stratos Genomics’) for the Diagnostics Division. The total initial cash consideration was CHF 1.2 billion
and additional contingent payments may be made based upon the achievement of performance-related milestones. Of this
CHF 0.4 billion related to the Promedior asset acquisition, by which the Group obtained rights to Promedior’s entire portfolio
including phase III-ready asset PRM-151, a recombinant human pentraxin-2 molecule for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (IPF). A further CHF 0.4 billion related to the Inflazome asset acquisition, by which the Group obtained full rights to
Inflazome’s entire portfolio which is composed of clinical and preclinical orally available small molecule NLRP3 inhibitors. These
transactions did not qualify as business combinations under IFRS 3 and have been accounted for as additions to intangible
assets. The cash flows from business combinations and asset acquisitions, including the settlement of contingent consideration
arrangements, do not form part of the free cash flow.
Further details are given in Note 6 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Alliance transactions
During 2020 the Group completed the licensing agreement with Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (‘Sarepta’) that was announced
on 23 December 2019 and under which the Group acquired the exclusive rights to launch and commercialise SRP-9001,
Sarepta’s investigational micro-dystrophin gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) outside the US. The initial
payments resulted in the recognition of CHF 0.8 billion of intangible assets and CHF 0.3 billion of equity investments.
On 14 July 2020 the Group announced a collaboration with Blueprint Medicines Corporation (‘Blueprint Medicines’) for the
co-development and co-commercialisation rights for pralsetinib (Gavreto), an investigational, precision therapy in late-stage
development for people with RET-altered non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), various types of thyroid cancer and other solid
tumours. Under the terms of the agreement, the Group made initial payments of CHF 0.8 billion, of which CHF 0.7 billion were
recognised as intangible assets and CHF 0.1 billion as an equity investment. The parties will co-commercialise pralsetinib
in the US while the Group will be responsible for commercial activities outside the US. Gavreto was approved in the US for
the treatment of adults with metastatic RET-fusion-positive NSCLC in September 2020 and for the treatment of people with
advanced or metastatic RET-mutant and RET-fusion-positive thyroid cancers in December 2020.
On 19 August 2020 the Group entered into a licensing agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (‘Regeneron’).
The parties will collaborate on developing and manufacturing Regeneron’s investigational COVID-19 antibody combination
of casirivimab and imdevimab, which is in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Under the terms of the agreement, each company has committed to dedicate a certain manufacturing capacity to casirivimab
and imdevimab each year. Regeneron will distribute casirivimab and imdevimab in the US and the Group will be responsible
for distribution outside the US. There were no initial payments. In November 2020 Regeneron announced that its antibody
combination of casirivimab and imdevimab received Emergency Use Authorization in the US.Finance Report 2020 Financial Review | Roche Group 11
On 22 October 2020 the Group entered into a licensing agreement with Atea Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (‘Atea’) under which the
parties will co-develop AT-527, Atea’s orally administered direct-acting small molecule antiviral for COVID-19 patients. An initial
payment of CHF 0.3 billion was recognised as intangible asset. If approved, Atea will distribute AT-527 in the US, with the
option to request the Group’s support, and the Group will be responsible for global manufacturing and distribution outside the US.
Other significant transactions included an upfront payment of CHF 0.2 billion to Arrakis Therapeutics for a strategic
collaboration and licensing agreement for the discovery of RNA-targeted small molecule (rSM) drugs against a broad set of
targets across all of the Pharmaceutical Division’s research and development areas. There was also an upfront payment of
CHF 0.2 billion to Vaccibody AS for a worldwide collaboration and licensing agreement to develop DNA-based individualised
neoantigen cancer vaccines based on VB10.NEO across multiple tumour types. In addition there was also an upfront
payment of CHF 0.1 billion to Vividion Therapeutics for rights to Vividion’s proteomics screening platform and proprietary
small molecule library to target novel E3 ligases, as well as a range of oncology and immunology therapeutic targets. An
upfront payment of CHF 0.1 billion was to UCB for rights to UCB’s investigational monoclonal antibody drug being developed
as a potential treatment for patients with Alzheimer’s Disease.
In total in-licensing and alliance transactions completed in 2020 resulted in intangible assets of CHF 3.1 billion being
recognised (2019: CHF 1.6 billion). The total cash outflow of CHF 3.6 billion included the Sarepta and Blueprint Medicines
equity investments as well as a payment of CHF 0.2 billion relating to the 2019 Dicerna Pharmaceuticals transaction for
treatments of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Of this total amount, CHF 3.1 billion was included in the Pharmaceuticals
Division’s operating free cash flow, CHF 0.1 billion in the Diagnostics Division’s operating free cash flow and the CHF 0.4 billion
Sarepta and Blueprint Medicines equity investments was included in the free cash flow from treasury activities.
For all the above transactions, additional payments may be made based upon the achievement of performance-related
milestones and from profit-sharing and royalty arrangements.
Global restructuring plans
During 2020 the Group continued with the implementation of various global restructuring plans initiated in prior years.

Diagnostics Division. Strategy plans in the Diagnostics Division incurred costs of CHF 100 million, mainly for employee-related
costs.
Site consolidation. Employee-related costs were mainly for the optimisation of enabling functions within the drug product
network. Other site closure costs included an impairment reversal of CHF 42 million.
Other global restructuring plans. Major items included employee-related costs of CHF 427 million, mainly for the outsourcing
of operational activities to the global shared service centres and external providers as well as to driving business transformation
and efficiency gains.
In 2019 total global restructuring costs were CHF 1.2 billion. Further details are given in Note 7 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
Pharmaceuticals Division. The Pharmaceuticals Division recorded impairment charges to intangible assets of CHF 0.4 billion.
The major part was an impairment charge of CHF 0.3 billion coming from the partial impairment of the intangible asset for
SPK-8011, a novel gene therapy for the treatment of haemophilia A, acquired as part of the Spark Therapeutics acquisition.
The impairment was a result of a delay in clinical trials, partly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to reduced
sales expectations. In addition, there was a charge of CHF 0.1 billion related to the partial impairment of the product intangible
asset for Luxturna, a marketed gene therapy for the treatment of patients with inherited retinal disease due to mutations in
both copies of the RPE65 gene, which was acquired as part of the Spark Therapeutics acquisition. This impairment was a result
of reduced sales expectations.
Diagnostics Division. There were impairment charges of CHF 0.2 billion relating to the goodwill from the AVL Medical
Instruments and GeneWeave acquisitions as detailed in Note 9 to the Annual Financial Statements. There were no other
impairments of intangible assets in the Diagnostics Division.
In 2019 there were impairment charges of CHF 0.6 billion in the Pharmaceuticals Division. The Diagnostics Division recorded
impairment charges of CHF 1.1 billion. The major part of this was a charge of CHF 0.8 billion for the partial write-off of goodwill
related to the Diabetes Care business.
Further details are given in Notes 9 and 10 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Legal and environmental cases
Based on the development of the various litigations, notably the Accutane case in the US, some of the provisions previously
held were released which resulted in an income of CHF 0.4 billion. There were no other significant developments affecting the
2020 financial results. Further details are given in Note 20 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Net income and earnings per share
IFRS net income increased by 7% in CHF terms and by 17% at CER while Core EPS increased by 4% at CER and decreased by
5% in CHF. The core basis excludes non-core items such as global restructuring costs, amortisation and impairment of goodwill
and intangible assets, and mergers and acquisitions and alliance arrangements. The amount of net income attributable to
non-controlling interests increased by 29% on an IFRS basis, and by 27% on a core basis, due to the increased contribution of
Chugai to the overall Group results.Finance Report 2020 Financial Review | Roche Group 13

Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc appreciated against almost all currencies, with the US dollar having a strong
effect and, additionally, the Japanese yen and the Brazilian real having a significant effect on the Group’s net operating
assets. This had a negative translation impact, which was partly offset at Group level by the natural hedge from the Group’s
US dollar-denominated debt. The exchange rates used are given on page 36.14 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2020
Net working capital increased significantly in both divisions. In the Pharmaceuticals Division inventories increased driven by
active management to ensure product availability and by launch supply. The net liability position for other receivables/payables
decreased due to the settlement of accruals recorded at the end of 2019. In the Diagnostics Division inventories increased
due to the ongoing rollout of COVID-19-related products, notably the recently launched SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test, while
trade receivables increased due to the sales growth. Overall long-term net operating assets increased due to in-licensing
and alliance arrangements, and also due to asset acquisitions. These added CHF 3.9 billion in the Pharmaceuticals Division and
CHF 0.4 billion in the Diagnostics Division to intangible assets, partly offset by impairments of goodwill and intangible assets.
The decrease in net debt was driven by the free cash flow of CHF 10.9 billion, offset by the annual dividend payments of
CHF 8.0 billion and outflows on transactions in own equity instruments of CHF 2.1 billion. The net pension liability was 7% higher
following a decrease in discount rates in most regions. The net tax assets increased mainly due to taxes paid exceeding the
income tax expenses and the deferred tax effects of the pension plans. Lease liabilities of CHF 1.2 billion increased by 5% mainly
due to additional office space rented by Flatiron Health.

The Group’s operating free cash flow for 2020 was CHF 14.8 billion, a decrease of 21% at CER. This was due to increased
net working capital and higher investments in in-licensing and alliance arrangements. In the Pharmaceuticals Division the lower
sales and the increased research and development spending had a negative impact on the operating free cash flow, partly
offset by lower spending on marketing and distribution. In the Diagnostics Division the sales growth had a positive impact on the
operating free cash flow. The free cash flow in 2020 was CHF 10.9 billion, a decrease of 26% at CER, due to the lower operating
free cash flow and higher financial long-term investments, partly offset by lower interest paid and lower taxes paid.Finance Report 2020 Financial Review | Roche Group 15

Biosimilar competition and the COVID-19 pandemic had an overall negative impact on the division’s sales in 2020. There
was a general dampening on sales from the COVID-19-related restrictions beginning with the second quarter. Hospitalisations
and outpatient visits decreased, which particularly impacted sales of Ocrevus, Hemlibra, Lucentis and MabThera/Rituxan.
New product sales continued to partly compensate for the increasing competition from biosimilars, notably MabThera/Rituxan,
Herceptin and Avastin in the US, and the COVID-19 impacts. Actemra/RoActemra sales increased by 32% driven by the
adoption in treatment guidelines for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
The sales growth of new products was driven by the continuing rollout of Tecentriq, Hemlibra, Ocrevus, Perjeta and Kadcyla,
which together contributed an additional CHF 3.9 billion (CER) of new sales. Tecentriq sales grew by 55% to CHF 2.7 billion,
mostly due to higher demand in the US and major EU markets. The launch and rollout of Hemlibra continued across the US,
Japan and major EU markets with sales reaching CHF 2.2 billion, an increase of 68%, while Ocrevus continued its growth
development, with a 24% sales increase to CHF 4.3 billion. The sales and uptake of both Ocrevus and Hemlibra were especially
adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Perjeta sales were up by 18%, with China being a major driver of growth.
Kadcyla sales grew by 34% mainly due to higher demand in the US and Europe with further patients switched to the new
standard of care following the positive readout of the KATHERINE study in October 2018.
Biosimilar competition had a negative impact, with continuing erosion for Herceptin, MabThera/Rituxan and Avastin, mostly in
the US. Global sales of these three products fell by CHF 5.8 billion (CER) to total sales of CHF 12.9 billion, a decrease of 30% in
2020. The COVID-19 pandemic also had an impact on sales of these three products, notably in China and for MabThera/Rituxan
in the US. Sales in China were also affected following price updates since the inclusion in the National Reimbursement Drug List
(NRDL). The first biosimilar versions of Herceptin, Avastin and MabThera/Rituxan entered the market in the US in the second
half of 2019 and combined US sales on these three products were CHF 3.8 billion (CER) lower in 2020. Sales of Herceptin and
MabThera/Rituxan in Europe declined by CHF 0.5 billion (CER). Sales of Avastin in Europe declined by CHF 0.4 billion (CER)
in the second half of 2020 since the first biosimilar version of Avastin entered the market.
Sales in the oncology therapeutic area decreased by 10%, due to the biosimilar competition for Herceptin, Avastin and
MabThera/Rituxan described above, partially compensated by growth of Tecentriq and Perjeta. Tecentriq sales grew in
all regions, mostly due to higher demand in the US and major EU markets and the rollout in Japan. Perjeta sales increased
mostly due to growth in China. Kadcyla and Alecensa both showed continuing post-launch growth across all regions.
Sales in immunology grew by 3%, with Actemra/RoActemra and Xolair increasing by 32% and 2%, respectively. The increase in
Actemra/RoActemra sales was mainly driven by the adoption of this medicine by many countries in their guidelines to treat
patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. MabThera/Rituxan sales in immunology decreased by 32% driven by the US, due to
the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and biosimilar entry. Lucentis sales declined by 16% in the US and were affected by
COVID-19 restrictions disrupting ophthalmology practices and limiting patient access. Infectious diseases sales were 15% lower
due to lower sales of Tamiflu and Rocephin.Finance Report 2020 Financial Review | Roche Group 17

US sales decreased by 37% due to the launch of biosimilars. In Europe the sales decrease was due to biosimilar competition in
the second half of the year and competitive pressure, notably in Germany, France and Italy. In Japan sales decreased due to
the government price cut and biosimilar competition. In the International region, the main driver in the sales decline was Canada.

There was continuously growing demand in both indications in the US, with growth driven both by new and returning patients,
with a higher proportion of sales coming from returning patients. In Europe and the International region Ocrevus continues
to show strong uptake where launched, notably in France, Germany, Canada and Spain. Sales of Ocrevus were impacted by
COVID-19 as the treatment is administered by intravenous infusion and requires hospital visits, which in many cases were
cancelled or delayed during the pandemic restrictions.
MabThera/Rituxan. For non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL)

Sales in the HER2 franchise decreased by 8% to CHF 9.4 billion. Herceptin sales were 34% lower, driven by biosimilar launches
which started in the second half of 2019 in the US and in mid-2018 in Japan and Europe. Sales of Perjeta grew by 18% with
increases mostly driven by China in both the early breast cancer and metastatic breast cancer settings. In the US, sales
of Perjeta grew by 2% due to growth in the early breast cancer setting, partly offset by COVID-19 restrictions. Kadcyla sales
increased by 34%, notably in the early breast cancer setting. Kadcyla sales benefited from the positive readout from the
KATHERINE study and by patients switching to the new standard of care.20 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2020

Sales increased by 32%, with growth driven by the adoption of Actemra/RoActemra by many countries in their treatment
guidelines to treat patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The US was the major contributor to the sales increase,
along with Russia, India and Spain. Various clinical studies (COVACTA and EMPACTA) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
Actemra/RoActemra in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia have been carried out and the results made available
to healthcare authorities.

United States. Sales decreased by 6% driven by the combined 38% fall in Herceptin, Avastin and MabThera/Rituxan sales
due to the launches of biosimilars as well as market contractions due to COVID-19 particularly for MabThera/Rituxan.
Hemlibra continued to show strong uptake since being launched in November 2017. Actemra/RoActemra sales increased
by 36% mostly due to the use for hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Tecentriq sales increased by 40%
due to growth in the new indications. Ocrevus sales increased by 18% and were driven by both new and returning patient
demand, partly dampened by COVID-19 effects. Sales in the HER2 franchise decreased by 20%, driven by lower Herceptin
sales, partially offset by a 34% sales increase for Kadcyla, notably in the early breast cancer setting. Lucentis sales
decreased due to COVID-19 impacts.
Europe. Sales grew by 1% with new product sales more than compensating for the biosimilar competition to Herceptin (–32%),
MabThera/Rituxan (–33%) and Avastin (–27%) and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tecentriq sales continued to grow and
increased by 72% following successful launches, notably in Germany, and continued uptake across Europe. Hemlibra (+135%)
and Ocrevus (+41%) showed strong uptake, in particular in France and Germany.
Japan. Sales decreased by 6%, driven by lower sales of Avastin (–15%), Herceptin (–40%) and MabThera/Rituxan (–39%) which
were negatively affected by biosimilar competition and government price cuts. This decline was partially compensated for by
recently launched products including Tecentriq and Hemlibra. Perjeta grew by 9% due to the launch of an additional indication
for early breast cancer.
International. Sales increased by 7%, mostly driven by China and Russia. There was a strong uptake in China of Perjeta
and Alecensa, partially offset by the NRDL price update and the COVID-19 impacts. Most of the 8% sales increase in China
was due to the base effect of the reduction in the level of channel inventory in 2019. Sales in the rest of the International
region increased by 7% with growth in new products (Perjeta, Ocrevus, Tecentriq, Hemlibra, Kadcyla and Alecensa) and
Actemra/RoActemra more than offsetting a decline in Herceptin and MabThera/Rituxan. Sales in Russia grew due to the
inclusion of Tecentriq, Kadcyla, Perjeta and Herceptin in the National Oncology Program, the adoption of Actemra/RoActemra
in the country’s COVID-19 treatment guidelines as well as the launches of Hemlibra and Ocrevus.Finance Report 2020 Financial Review | Roche Group 23

Competition from generic medicines and biosimilars
The Group’s pharmaceutical products are generally protected by patent rights, which are intended to provide the Group with
exclusive marketing rights in various countries. However, patent rights are of varying scope and duration, and the Group may
be required to enter into costly litigation to enforce its patent and other intellectual property rights. Loss of market exclusivity
for one or more major products – either due to patent expiration, challenges from generic medicines, biosimilars and non-
comparable biologics or other reasons – could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations
or financial condition. The introduction of a generic, biosimilar or non-comparable biologic version of the same or a similar
medicine typically results in a significant reduction in net sales for the relevant product, as other manufacturers typically offer
their versions at lower prices.
Patents and their expiry are, and always have been, an integral part of the Group’s business model and future growth will
remain driven by innovation. The latest information from clinical studies is included in the Annual Report and details of the
Group’s Product Development Portfolio are available for download at:
http://www.roche.com/research_and_development/who_we_are_how_we_work/pipeline.htm
The intellectual property for biologics can involve multiple patents and patent timelines for each individual product and
therefore it is more difficult to give an exact date for patent expiry for biologic medicines. The Group’s basic, primary patents
for MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin have expired in the US and the EU. The secondary patent rights for subcutaneous
formulations of MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin expire beyond 2025. In addition there are recent and approaching patent
expiries in the US for Lucentis which may have an impact on 2021 sales for this product.
Biosimilar competition for MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin in the US, Europe and Japan had an estimated negative
impact of CHF 5.1 billion (CER) in 2020, with the main impact being sales in the US which fell by CHF 3.8 billion (CER).
The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the overall market in 2020, notably for MabThera/Rituxan in the US.
United States. The first biosimilar versions of Herceptin and Avastin were launched in the US from mid-2019 and the first
biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan in late 2019. Sales in 2020 for these three products were CHF 3.8 billion lower (CER)
than in the prior period, a decline of 38%. US sales of these three products were also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic which
had a certain impact on the overall market, particularly for MabThera/Rituxan.
Europe. The first biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin were launched in Europe from mid-2017 and from
mid-2018, respectively. They are now marketed in most EU countries and were the major factor in the continuing sales decline
of CHF 0.5 billion (CER) for these two products in Europe in 2020. The first biosimilar versions of Avastin came to market in
Europe from mid-2020 and were a significant factor in the decline in sales of CHF 0.4 billion (CER) for Avastin in Europe in the
second half of 2020.
Japan. In Japan, the first biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin were launched in 2018. Sales were impacted by
this and by government price cuts. Biosimilar versions of Avastin were launched in late 2019 in the colorectal cancer indication
and in 2020 in the non-small cell lung cancer indication. Sales of these three products combined in 2020 were 22% lower and
were impacted by competition and by government price cuts.24 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2020

regional breakdowns. These are summarised in the table below. As noted in the previous sections, the year-on-year movements
are also driven by regular price and volume changes, as well as by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Biosimilar
competition is only one factor in the overall picture.

Venclyxto sales outside the US increased, while royalty income from Lucentis sales outside the US was lower. The decrease
of o ut-licensing income was due to lower milestone income. Income from product disposals and other decreased due to an income
in 2019 of CHF 446 million from sale of rights for Lexotan, Bactrim and Dormicum. This was partially compensated by an income
in 2020 of CHF 202 million from the sale of the global rights for Rocaltrol, excluding China and Japan, and Valium, as well as higher
profit-share income due to increased sales of Venclexta/Venclyxto in the US.Finance Report 2020 Financial Review | Roche Group 25

Core costs decreased by 16% at CER. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased by 2.7 percentage points to 18.2%.
Manufacturing cost of sales decreased by 13%, while sales declined by 2%. This was due to inventory write-offs in 2019,
product mix factors and productivity improvements. Royalty expenses were 14% lower with a decrease in royalty expenses
related to the expired Cabilly patent, partially offset by increased sales for certain royalty-bearing products, notably
Ocrevus. Collaboration and profit-sharing expenses decreased by 18% driven by lower US sales of MabThera/Rituxan. In 2019
an impairment of property, plant and equipment for idle plant was recognised. Restructuring costs mainly related to resourcing
flexibility initiatives. Amortisation charges went up by 10% due to the Rozlytrek product intangible assets, which started
being amortised after the product launch in the second half of 2019, and the Luxturna product intangible assets from the

Core costs decreased by 8% at CER. As a percentage of sales, they decreased to 14.9% from 15.7% in the comparative period.
Major marketing and distribution activities included supporting the rollouts of Tecentriq, Ocrevus and Perjeta and supporting
the launch activities in 2020. The cost decrease was mainly due to a general slowdown in marketing activities in 2020, including
lower expenses for congresses due to COVID-19 restrictions. The cost decrease was also associated with lower personnel
expenses in 2020, including lower headcount costs in the field force. Restructuring costs were related to transformation
initiatives.

Core costs increased by 8% at CER and, as a percentage of sales, increased by 2.7 percentage points to 23.8%. The oncology
franchise remained the primary area of research and development with the cancer immunotherapy portfolio being a key driver.
Neuroscience and immunology also represent significant areas of spending. Growth in spend is mostly driven by late-stage
investments in ophthalmology, personalised healthcare and neuroscience, as well as spending at Spark Therapeutics and
Flatiron Health. Amortisation charges were higher notably due to the exercise of a priority review voucher. Impairment charges
in 2020 were mainly a result of a delay in clinical trials for the Spark Therapeutics’ haemophilia A intangible asset.26 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2020
In addition, the Pharmaceuticals Division acquired various product intangibles under development and technologies through
in-licensing transactions and asset acquisitions, which in total added CHF 3.9 billion to intangible assets. The major items were
payments of CHF 0.8 billion to Sarepta for the exclusive right to launch and commercialise SRP-9001, Sarepta’s investigational
micro-dystrophin gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) outside the US and CHF 0.7 billion to Blueprint Medicines,
where, as part of a licensing and collaboration agreement, the Group obtained co-development and co-commercialisation rights
for pralsetinib (Gavreto), Blueprint Medicines’ investigational, precision therapy in late-stage development for people with
RET-altered non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), various types of thyroid cancer and other solid tumours. Other investments
include payments of CHF 0.3 billion to Atea, CHF 0.4 billion for the Inflazome asset acquisition and CHF 0.4 billion for the
Promedior asset acquisition. See the above sections on ‘Mergers and acquisitions’ and ‘Alliance transactions’ for further details.

Core costs increased by 6% at CER and, as a percentage of sales, increased to 3.8% from 3.5% in 2019. Administration costs
were higher mainly due to the recently acquired Spark Therapeutics and also Flatiron Health and Foundation Medicine. Business
taxes and capital taxes increased by 24% primarily due to the relatively lower costs for the US Branded Prescription Drug Fee in
2019. Other general items increased due to lower personnel costs. Restructuring costs were related to business transformation
initiatives. The income from legal and environmental cases was related to the release of the Accutane US litigation provision.

Pharmaceuticals Division total core operating profit and operating profit both include the elimination of CHF minus 267 million of unrealised intercompany gains between
Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai (2019: CHF minus 258 million).
At CER (as reported in Japanese yen), sales by Chugai to external customers decreased by 6% while sales within the division
increased by 53%. Chugai core operating profit increased by 35% due to higher royalty income from Roche Pharmaceuticals
as well as higher gross profit from sales within the division. This was partially offset by higher research and development costs.
Operating free cash flow at Chugai increased by 10% at CER mainly as a result of the strong operating performance partially
offset by an increase in net working capital. The appreciation of the Swiss franc against the Japanese yen had an adverse
impact of approximately 3 percentage points on the Chugai core operating profit in the Group’s consolidated results expressed
in Swiss francs.Finance Report 2020 Financial Review | Roche Group 27

a) Provisional 2019 balance sheet amounts restated for final accounting of Spark Therapeutics acquisition (see Note 6 to the Annual Financial Statements).
The absolute amount of the movement between the 2020 and 2019 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2020 transactions (translated at
average rates for 2019) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2020 transactions include non-cash movements and therefore the
movements in this table are not the same as the amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only includes the cash movements). A full consolidated balance sheet is
given on page 51 of the Annual Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given above is on page 175.
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc appreciated
against almost all currencies, with the US dollar having a strong effect and, additionally, the Japanese yen and Brazilian
real having a significant effect on the net operating assets of the Pharmaceuticals Division. This resulted in a net negative
translation impact. The exchange rates used are given on page 36.
Net working capital. Net working capital increased by 87%, while net trade working capital was 8% higher. Inventory was higher
by 19% and driven by active management to ensure product availability and by launch supply. Trade receivables increased
by 2% compared to the start of the year, with the 21% increase due to temporarily extended payment terms in the US noted
in the interim results at 30 June 2020 being settled in the second half of 2020. The net liability position for other receivables/
payables decreased following the settlement of the accruals recorded at the end of 2019.
Long-term net operating assets. Overall long-term net operating assets increased by 12%, due to increased intangible assets
and lower provisions. Intangible asset additions from in-licensing transactions and asset acquisitions in the Pharmaceuticals
Division were CHF 3.9 billion, and include the CHF 0.8 billion paid to Sarepta for the exclusive rights to launch and commercialise
Sarepta’s investigational micro-dystrophin gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) outside the US. Furthermore
Roche paid CHF 0.7 billion to Blueprint Medicines for the co-development and co-commercialisation rights for pralsetinib (Gavreto),
an investigational, precision therapy in late-stage development for people with RET-altered non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
various types of thyroid cancer and other solid tumours. Additional intangible assets purchases were for the asset acquisitions
of Inflazome and Promedior and upfront payments to Atea, Arrakis Therapeutics, Vaccibody, Vividion Therapeutics and UCB
(see the above section on ‘Alliance transactions’). Capital expenditure includes manufacturing investments in the US, Japan,
Switzerland and Germany, site developments in Switzerland and the US, and Chugai’s research facilities at Yokohama in Japan.
In total the additional capital expenditure for COVID-19-related projects in the Pharmaceuticals Division was CHF 90 million.
Provisions decreased due to the release of the Accutane US litigation provision and the cash settlement for past royalties related
to the PDL-1 inhibitor litigation.28 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2020

See pages 171–173 for the definition of free cash flow and a detailed breakdown.
The Pharmaceuticals Division’s operating free cash flow decreased by 26% at CER to CHF 13.9 billion. The cash generation
of the business, measured by the operating profit, net of operating cash adjustments, was down 6%. The lower sales and
the increased research and development spending had a negative impact on the operating free cash flow, partly offset by
lower spending on marketing and distribution. Net working capital absorbed an additional CHF 1.3 billion of cash, largely
driven by higher inventory and the settlement of payables, for the reasons described above in the ‘Financial position’ section.
Capital expenditure was higher than in the prior year, in part due to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Investments
in intangible assets were significantly higher than in 2019 and include payments to Sarepta of CHF 0.8 billion, to Blueprint
Medicines of CHF 0.7 billion and the new in-licensing and alliance transactions with Atea, Arrakis Therapeutics, Vaccibody,
Vividion Therapeutics and UCB as well as the payment for the 2019 Dicerna Pharmaceuticals transaction (see the above
section on ‘Alliance transactions’). The appreciation of the Swiss franc had a significant negative impact on the free cash flows

The Diagnostics Division reported overall sales growth of 14% at CER to CHF 13.8 billion. The COVID-19 pandemic had
contrasting impacts in the different parts of the business. Molecular Diagnostics reported a sales growth of 90% due to the
launch of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, while Centralised and Point of Care Solutions sales decreased by 1% due to the
reduction in routine testing volume, partially offset by the launch of COVID-19 testing products in the second half of 2020.
Diabetes Care sales declined by 5% due to the continued overall contraction of the blood glucose monitoring market and the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.30 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2020
The sales of the various COVID-19-related tests was CHF 2.6 billion (CER), offsetting the decline in routine testing, and driving
the Diagnostics Division annual growth of 14%. Sales of COVID-19-related tests in Molecular Diagnostics were CHF 2.1 billion
(CER), consisting mainly of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests launched in March 2020, while the remaining CHF 0.5 billion (CER)
of COVID-19-related test sales were in Centralised and Point of Care Solutions, mostly for the SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test
launched in September 2020.

Overall sales decreased by 1% due to the combined effects of healthcare centres deprioritising routine care to allocate more
resources to COVID-19 preparedness efforts and patients avoiding healthcare centres for fear of exposure to COVID-19.
In EMEA, the decline of routine testing business has been more than compensated by the sales growth of the point-of-care
COVID-19 testing products, while in North America, this decline was offset by the CustomBiotech business. In the Rest of
World sales were lower, notably in China where lower immunodiagnostic reagent sales were not compensated by point-of-care
COVID-19 testing sales.

Molecular Diagnostics was the global driver of sales growth, mainly in North America and EMEA, offsetting the reductions in
the routine testing business in the rest of the portfolio. Furthermore sales in EMEA were positively impacted by the Centralised
and Point of Care Solutions business due to sales of SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test allowing fast triage decisions at point of
care. The sales decrease in Asia-Pacific was driven by China (–11%) due to the decrease in routine testing following the COVID-19
pandemic restrictions. The Diagnostics Division continued to reduce channel inventory in China.

Administration costs were 2% higher due to legal expenses in the US. The global restructuring plan costs in 2020 relate
mainly to employee expenses for strategy plans. The impairment charges of CHF 247 million in 2020 are due to the goodwill
impairment related to the AVL Medical Instruments and GeneWeave acquisitions. Mergers and acquisitions and alliance
transactions in both 2020 and 2019 included income from the reversal of contingent consideration provisions. Legal and
environmental costs in 2019 included litigation costs for the Meso case.

The absolute amount of the movement between the 2020 and 2019 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2020 transactions (translated at
average rates for 2019) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2020 transactions include non-cash movements and therefore the
movements in this table are not the same as the amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only includes the cash movements). A full consolidated balance sheet is
given on page 51 of the Annual Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given above is on page 175.34 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2020
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc appreciated
against almost all currencies, with the US dollar having a strong effect and, additionally, the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira
having a significant effect on the net operating assets of the Diagnostics Division. This resulted in a negative translation
impact. The exchange rates used are given on page 36.
Net working capital. Net working capital increased by 15% due to higher inventories and trade receivables partially offset by
a higher net liability for other receivables/payables. Inventory increased by 29% due to the ongoing rollout of COVID-19-related
products, including the recently launched SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen test. The 13% increase in trade receivables is due to
the sales growth of 14%. The increase in net liability for other receivables/payables came from higher product accruals and
employee-related accruals in 2020.
Long-term net operating assets. Overall long-term net operating assets increased by 3% at CER, which was mainly attributable
to the increase in property, plant and equipment from site investments in Germany, the US and Switzerland. This included
COVID-19-related manufacturing expansion of CHF 137 million. Intangible assets were lower due to the goodwill impairment
relating to the AVL Medical Instruments and GeneWeave acquisitions. This was partly offset by intangible asset additions from
in-licensing transactions and asset acquisitions, in the Diagnostics Division of CHF 0.4 billion, mainly from the Stratos Genomics
asset acquisition.

The operating free cash flow of the Diagnostics Division was CHF 1.6 billion, an increase of 96% compared to 2019. The cash
generation of the business, measured by the operating profit, net of operating cash adjustments, increased by CHF 820 million
(+41%) with the sales growth having a positive impact on the operating free cash flow. Net working capital increased and
absorbed CHF 738 million of cash in 2020, which was attributable to increases in inventories and receivables offset by higher
payables and accruals for the reasons described above in the ‘Financial position’ section. Capital expenditure was slightly
higher due to site investments. The decline in investments in intangible assets was related to an in-licensing transaction in 2019.
The appreciation of the Swiss franc had a significant negative impact on the free cash flows measures expressed in CHF terms.Finance Report 2020 Financial Review | Roche Group 35

General and administration costs increased by 8% at CER on a core basis with administration costs also higher by 8%. This increase
is due to the build-up of the shared service centre network which provides services to both divisions. Total costs on an IFRS
basis were affected by a lower level of restructuring activities in corporate functions. Corporate operating free cash flow showed
a higher outflow due to higher administration costs and the settlement of payables.36 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2020

The Group’s revenues are primarily generated from sales of products to customers. Such revenues are mainly received in the
local currency of the customer’s home market, although in certain emerging markets invoicing is made in major international
currencies such as the US dollar and euro. Cost of sales, marketing and some administration costs follow the same currency
pattern as sales. The majority of research and development activities are incurred at the Group’s global research facilities,
and therefore the costs are mainly concentrated in US dollars, Swiss francs and euros. General and administration costs tend
to be incurred mainly at central locations in the US, Switzerland and Germany. Chugai’s revenues and costs are denominated
in Japanese yen.Finance Report 2020 Financial Review | Roche Group 37

Financing costs
Core financing costs were CHF 539 million, a decrease of 41% at CER compared to 2019. Interest expenses on debt decreased
by 26% at CER to CHF 411 million mainly due to early repayment of debt in the second half of 2019. There were no losses on
early debt redemption in 2020 (2019: CHF 202 million). The net interest cost of defined benefit pension plans decreased by 24%
at CER due to lower discount rates in Germany and the US at the end of 2019. A full analysis of financing costs is given in Note 4
to the Annual Financial Statements.38 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2020
Other financial income (expense)
Core other financial income (expense) was a net expense of CHF 25 million compared to a net income of CHF 59 million in 2019.
Income from equity securities, which predominantly reflects the fair value changes and realised gains and losses in the Roche
Venture Fund investments, notably the investment in Allakos, reported a net gain of CHF 170 million compared to a net gain of
CHF 185 million in 2019. The net interest income decreased by 81% at CER to CHF 17 million due to lower liquid funds levels
available for investments at lower interest rates compared to 2019. The net foreign exchange results, which reflect hedging
costs and losses on unhedged positions, were losses of CHF 206 million compared to net losses of CHF 205 million in 2019.
A full analysis of other financial income (expense) is given in Note 4 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Income taxes
The Group’s effective core tax rate increased by 0.8 percentage points to 17.1% in 2020. This was mainly due to the impact of
the resolution of several tax disputes which reduced the Group’s effective core tax rate by 1.5 percentage points in 2020 and
2.1 percentage points in 2019.
The IFRS results saw the effective tax rate increase by 1.0 percentage points. In addition to the core impacts mentioned above,
the non-core impacts from the 2019 Swiss tax reform and the impairments of goodwill that are not tax deductible also impacted
the IFRS tax rate. The IFRS results also include the releases of contingent consideration provisions that are not taxable, hence
the net effect in the ‘Mergers and acquisitions and alliance transactions’ line in the table below.
Further details of the Group’s income tax expenses and related balance sheet positions are given in Note 5 to the Annual
Financial Statements.

Financial position
The decrease in net debt was driven by the free cash flow of CHF 10.9 billion, offset by the annual dividend payments of
CHF 8.0 billion and outflows on transactions in own equity instruments of CHF 2.1 billion. The net pension liability was
higher due to a decrease in discount rates in most regions. The net tax assets increased mainly due to taxes paid exceeding
the income tax expenses and the deferred tax effects of the pension plans. At 31 December 2020 the Group held equity
investments with a market value of CHF 1.3 billion, which consist mostly of holdings in biotechnology and other pharmaceuticals
companies which were acquired as part of licensing transactions and scientific collaborations or as investments of the Roche
Venture Fund.
Free cash flow
The net cash outflow from treasury activities remained stable at CHF 0.6 billion. The lower interest payments were offset by
investments in financial long-term assets, notably CHF 0.3 billion of equity in Sarepta. Total taxes paid in 2020 decreased to
CHF 3.2 billion in line with the lower pre-tax profits.Finance Report 2020 Financial Review | Roche Group 39

Operating free cash flow decreased by 21% at CER to CHF 14.8 billion (29% lower in CHF terms). This was due to increased
net working capital, where the delivery of COVID-19-related tests led to a certain build-up in inventories as at 31 December 2020.
There were also higher investments in in-licensing and alliance arrangements. In the Pharmaceuticals Division the lower sales
and the increased research and development spending had a negative impact on the operating free cash flow, partly offset by
lower spending on marketing and distribution. In the Diagnostics Division the sales growth had a positive impact on the operating
free cash flow. The free cash flow of CHF 10.9 billion was 26% lower than in 2019 at CER (35% lower in CHF), as a result of lower
operating free cash flow and higher financial long-term investments, partly offset by lower interest paid and lower taxes paid.
The appreciation of the Swiss franc had a significant negative impact on the free cash flows measures expressed in CHF terms.40 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2020

The net debt position of the Group at 31 December 2020 was CHF 1.9 billion, a decrease of CHF 0.6 billion from 31 December 2019.
This was driven by the free cash flow of CHF 10.9 billion, offset by the annual dividend payments of CHF 8.0 billion and outflows

Debt. This consists mainly of bonds and notes and includes the principal and interest on the Group’s debt instruments. Other
debt is mainly commercial paper. The carrying values are discounted based on the interest rates inherent in the instruments.
Contingent consideration. These are potential payments arising from mergers and acquisitions. The carrying values are
risk-adjusted and discounted.
Lease liabilities. These are the future obligations under non-cancellable lease contracts.
Unfunded defined benefit plans. These are mainly the pension plans in the Group’s German affiliates, where the fully reserved
pension obligations are used for self-financing of the local affiliates’ operations. The carrying values are discounted. Future
company contributions to the Group’s funded plans are not shown in the above table.
Capital commitments for property, plant and equipment. These are non-cancellable commitments for the purchase and
construction mainly at the Roche sites in Basel, Switzerland, South San Francisco, US, and Mannheim, Germany, and also at the
Chugai research and development site in Yokohama, Japan.
Leasing commitments. These are the major non-cancellable commitments for signed lease agreements where the lease term
has not yet started. These mainly relate to Foundation Medicine’s site in Boston, US.42 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2020
Contract manufacturing commitments. These are the future minimum take-or-pay commitments to purchase inventories
arising from the Group’s major long-term agreements with external Contract Manufacturing Organisations (‘CMOs’).
Alliance collaboration commitments. These are potential upfront and milestone payments that may become due from the
Group’s in-licensing and alliance arrangements and intangible asset purchase agreements, including asset acquisitions.
Potential payments to alliance partners and for asset purchase agreements within the next three years are included assuming
all projects currently in development are successful. Potential payments beyond three years are only included for asset
purchase agreements.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions into
a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation to pay further
contributions. In 2020 expenses for the Group’s defined contribution plans were CHF 409 million (2019: CHF 410 million). All
other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’, even if the Group’s potential obligation is minor or has a relatively remote
possibility of arising. Plans are usually established as trusts which are independent of the Group and are funded by payments
from the Group and by employees, but in some cases the plan is unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees
directly from its own financial resources. In 2020 expenses for the Group’s defined benefit plans were CHF 757 million
(2019: CHF 738 million).

Overall the funding status on an IFRS basis of the Group’s funded defined benefit plans increased to 94% compared to 92%
at the start of the year. This came from an increase in the fair value of plan assets partly offset by a higher defined benefit
obligation due to a decrease in discount rates in most regions. The funding status of the pension funds is monitored by the
local pension fund governance bodies as well as being closely reviewed at a Group level. The total cash outflow from the
Group’s defined benefit plans in 2020 was CHF 0.6 billion compared to CHF 0.7 billion in 2019. There were higher additional
contributions paid into the Group’s pension plans in Japan in 2020 and 2019.
The unfunded plans are mainly those in the Group’s German affiliates, where the fully reserved pension obligations are invested
in the local affiliate’s operations. The unfunded liabilities for these plans increased during 2020 due to a decrease in the
eurozone discount rate.

Statements.Finance Report 2020 Financial Review | Roche Group 43

In 2020 Roche ranked number 4 among a peer group consisting of Roche and 15 other healthcare companies a) for Total
Shareholder Return (TSR), defined as share price growth plus dividends, measured in Swiss francs at actual exchange rates.
At constant exchange rates (CER) Roche ranked number 6, with the year-end return being +3.8% for Roche shares and +1.3%
for Roche non-voting equity securities. The combined performance of share and non-voting equity security was +1.8% compared
to a weighted average return for the peer group of –1.9% in CHF terms and +4.7% at CER.
2020 was a year with very high volatility at the stock markets. Most equity markets recovered after heavy losses in the first
quarter of 2020. The Swiss Market Index (SMI) stayed stable, outperforming most European indices but trailing major US indices.
The global healthcare sector grew. Roche outperformed most peers, in CHF terms, with strong sales growth in Diagnostics and
launches of new products.

Proposed dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing an increase of 1% in the dividend for 2020 to CHF 9.10 per share and non-voting equity
security (2019: CHF 9.00) for approval at the Annual General Meeting. This would be the 34th consecutive increase in the
dividend. If the dividend proposal is approved by shareholders, dividend payments on the total shares and non-voting equity
securities will amount to CHF 7.8 billion (2019: CHF 7.8 billion), resulting in a pay-out ratio (based on core net income) of
47.5% (2019: 44.6%). Based on the prices at year-end 2020, the dividend yield on the Roche share was 2.9% (2019: 2.9%) and
the yield on the non-voting equity security was also 2.9% (2019: 2.9%). Further information on the Roche securities is given
on pages 177 to 178.

The Group plans to meet its debt obligations using existing liquid funds as well as cash generated from business operations.
In the full year 2020 the free cash flow was CHF 10.9 billion, which included the cash generated from operations, as well as
payment of interest and tax.
For short-term financing requirements, the Group has a commercial paper program in the US under which it can issue up to
USD 7.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper notes and has committed credit lines of USD 7.5 billion available as back-stop
lines. As at 31 December 2020 commercial paper notes totalling USD 1.8 billion were outstanding (2019: USD 1.4 billion). For
longer-term financing the Group maintains strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA by Standard & Poor’s and Aa3
by Moody’s which should facilitate efficient access to international capital markets.
Further information on the Group’s debt is given in Note 21 to the Annual Financial Statements.46 Roche Group | Financial Review Finance Report 2020
Financial risks
At 31 December 2020 the Group had a net debt position of CHF 1.9 billion (2019: CHF 2.5 billion). The financial assets of the
Group are managed in a conservative way with the objective to meet the Group’s financial obligations at all times.
Asset allocation. A considerable portion of the cash and marketable securities the Group currently holds is being used for debt
repayment. Liquid funds are either held as cash or are invested in high-quality, investment-grade fixed income securities with an
investment horizon to meet those liquidity requirements.

Credit risk. Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations causing
financial losses for the Group. The rating profile of the Group’s CHF 12.3 billion of cash and fixed income marketable securities
remained strong with 94% being invested in the A-AAA range. The Group has signed netting and collateral agreements with the
counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty risk on derivative positions.
The Group has trade receivables of CHF 11.0 billion. Since the beginning of 2010 there have been financial difficulties in
Southern European countries, notably Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. The Group is a leading supplier to the healthcare
sectors in these countries and at 31 December 2020 has trade receivables of EUR 0.5 billion (CHF 0.5 billion) with public
customers in these countries. This is a decrease of 13% compared to 31 December 2019 in euro terms. The Group uses different
measures to improve collections in these countries, including intense communication with customers, factoring, negotiations
of payment plans, charging of interest for late payments, and legal actions. Since 2011 the Group’s trade receivables balance in
Southern Europe has decreased by 67% in euro terms.
Liquidity risk. Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point
in time. The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity
requirements at any point in time. In addition to the current liquidity position, the Group has strong cash generation ability.
Those future cash flows will be used to repay debt instruments in the coming years.
Roche enjoys strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA by Standard & Poor’s and Aa3 by Moody’s. At the same
time Roche is rated at the highest available short-term ratings by those agencies. In the event of financing requirements, the
ratings and the strong credit of Roche should permit efficient access to international capital markets, including the commercial
paper market. The Group has committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling USD 7.5 billion available as
back-stop lines for the commercial paper program. As at 31 December 2020 no debt has been drawn under these credit lines.
Market risk. Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities. The exposures
are predominantly related to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The Group uses Value-at-Risk
(VaR) to assess the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. VaR data indicates the value range within which a
given financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices. The Group’s VaR
decreased since 31 December 2019 reflecting the reduction in US interest rates during 2020.
Interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could affect the Group’s financial result
or the value of the Group equity. The Group may use interest rate derivatives to manage its interest rate-related exposure and
financial result.
Further information on financial risk management and financial risks and the VaR methodology is included in Note 31 to the
Annual Financial Statements.Finance Report 2020 Financial Review | Roche Group 47
International Financial Reporting Standards
The Roche Group has been using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to report its consolidated results since 1990.
New and revised standards applied in 2020
In 2020 the Group has implemented various minor amendments to existing standards and interpretations, which have no
material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position. The amendments to IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ on
the definition of a business, which are mandatorily applicable in 2020, were early adopted by the Group in 2018.48 Roche Group | Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020

Notes to the Roche Group
Consolidated Financial Statements
1. General accounting principles
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements (hereafter ‘the Annual Financial Statements’) of the Roche Group have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. They have been prepared using
the historical cost convention except for items that are required to be accounted for at fair value. They were approved for issue
by the Board of Directors on 1 February 2021 and are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on
16 March 2021.
These financial statements are the Annual Financial Statements of Roche Holding Ltd, a company registered in Switzerland,
and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’).
The Group’s significant accounting policies and changes in accounting policies are disclosed in Note 34.
Key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Annual Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingent amounts. Actual outcomes could differ
from those management estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based
on historical experience and various other factors. Revisions to estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is
revised. The following are considered to be the key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions made and are believed
to be appropriate based upon currently available information.
Revenue. The nature of the Group’s business is such that many sales transactions do not have a simple structure and may
consist of various performance obligations that are satisfied at different times. Contracts entered into in the Diagnostics
Division typically include performance obligations for instruments (including those provided under leasing arrangements),
reagents and other consumables, and services. Instruments may be sold in cash sales transactions at discounted prices.
Where instruments are provided under operating lease arrangements, some or the entire lease revenue may be variable and
subject to subsequent reagents sales. Sales, net of discounts, are based on estimates regarding the related obligations,
including their stand-alone selling prices. It requires judgement to determine when different obligations are satisfied, including
whether enforceable purchase commitments for further obligations exist and when they arise. Out-licensing agreements
may be entered into with no further obligation or may include commitments to conduct research, late-stage development,
regulatory approval, co-marketing or manufacturing. These may be settled by a combination of upfront payments,
milestone payments, other licensing fees, and reimbursements for services provided. Whether to consider these commitments
as a single performance obligation or separate ones, or even being in scope of IFRS 15 ‘Revenues from Contracts with
Customers’, is not straightforward and requires some judgement. Depending on the conclusion, this may result in all revenue
being calculated at inception and either being recognised at once or spread over the term of a longer performance obligation.
Sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts and estimates of product returns,
all of which are established at the time of sale. All product sales allowances are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to
be claimed on the related sales. At 31 December 2020 the Group had CHF 4,165 million in provisions and accruals for expected
sales returns, chargebacks and other rebates, including Medicaid in the US and similar rebates in other countries. The provisions
and accruals relating to the US Pharmaceuticals business amounted to CHF 1,751 million, of which CHF 416 million were
associated with expected sales returns. These estimates take into consideration historical experience, current contractual and
statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends such as competitive pricing and new product introductions,
estimated inventory levels, and the shelf life of products. If actual future results vary, these estimates need to be adjusted, with
an effect on sales and earnings in the period of the adjustment.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 55
Business combinations. The Group initially recognises the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed,
any non-controlling interest and the consideration transferred in a business combination. Management judgement is particularly
involved in the assessment of whether or not the net assets acquired constitute a business and in the recognition and fair
value measurement of intellectual property, inventories, contingent liabilities and contingent consideration. In making this
assessment, management considers the underlying economic substance of the items concerned in addition to the contractual
terms. Management also applies as it considers appropriate the optional ‘concentration test’ as set out in IFRS 3 ‘Business
Combinations’ to aid the assessment of whether a transaction represents a business combination or is simply in substance the
purchase of a single asset or group of similar assets.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, goodwill and intangible assets. At 31 December 2020
the Group had CHF 22,158 million in property, plant and equipment (see Note 8), CHF 1,112 million in right-of-use assets
(see Note 28), CHF 9,249 million in goodwill (see Note 9) and CHF 12,017 million in intangible assets (see Note 10). Goodwill and
intangible assets not yet available for use are reviewed annually for impairment. Property, plant and equipment, right-of-use
assets and intangible assets in use are assessed for impairment when there is a triggering event that provides evidence that
an asset may be impaired. To assess whether any impairment exists, estimates of expected future cash flows are used. Actual
outcomes could vary significantly from such estimates. Factors such as changes in discount rates, the planned use of buildings,
machinery or equipment or closure of facilities, the presence of competition, technical obsolescence and lower-than-anticipated
product sales could lead to shorter useful lives or impairment.
Impairment of financial assets. At 31 December 2020 the Group had CHF 515 million in allowance for doubtful accounts
for trade and lease receivables (see Note 12). The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on assumptions about risk of
default and expected loss rates. The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the
calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts, based on the company’s past experience, existing market conditions as
well as forward-looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits. The Group operates a number of defined benefit plans, and the fair values
of the recognised plan assets and liabilities are based upon statistical and actuarial calculations. The measurement of the
net defined benefit obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate, inflation rate, expected mortality and
medical cost trend rate assumptions. At 31 December 2020 the present value of the Group’s defined benefit obligation is
CHF 24,949 million (see Note 26). The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changes
in market and economic conditions, longer or shorter lifespans of participants, and other changes in the factors being
assessed. These differences could impact the defined benefit plan assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in
future periods.
Legal provisions. The Group provides for anticipated legal settlement costs when there is a probable outflow of resources
that can be reliably estimated. Where no reliable estimate can be made, no provision is recorded and contingent liabilities are
disclosed where material. At 31 December 2020 the Group had CHF 395 million in legal provisions. The status of significant
legal cases is disclosed in Note 20. These estimates consider the specific circumstances of each legal case, relevant legal
advice and are inherently judgemental due to the highly complex nature of legal cases. The estimates could change
substantially over time as new facts emerge and each legal case progresses.
Environmental provisions. The Group provides for anticipated environmental remediation costs when there is a probable
outflow of resources that can be reasonably estimated. At 31 December 2020 the Group had CHF 443 million in environmental
provisions (see Note 20). Environmental provisions consist primarily of costs to fully clean and refurbish contaminated sites,
including landfills, and to treat and contain contamination at certain other sites. These estimates are inherently judgemental
due to uncertainties related to the detection of previously unknown contamination, the method and extent of remediation,
the percentage of the problematic materials attributable to the Group at the remediation sites, and the financial capabilities
of other potentially responsible parties. The estimates could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each
environmental remediation progresses.
Contingent consideration provisions. The Group makes provision for the estimated fair value of contingent consideration
arrangements arising from business combinations. At 31 December 2020 the Group had CHF 150 million in contingent
consideration provisions (see Note 20) and the total potential payments under contingent consideration arrangements from
business combinations could be up to CHF 368 million (see Note 31). The estimated amounts provided are the expected
payments, determined by considering the possible scenarios of forecast sales and other performance criteria, the amount
to be paid under each scenario, and the probability of each scenario, which is then discounted to a net present value. The
estimates could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each scenario develops.56 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020
Income taxes. At 31 December 2020 the Group had a current income tax net liability of CHF 3,530 million and a deferred tax
net asset of CHF 5,106 million (see Note 5). Significant estimates are required to determine the current and deferred tax assets
and liabilities. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Where tax positions
are uncertain, accruals are recorded within income tax liabilities for management’s best estimate of the ultimate liability that is
expected to arise based on the specific circumstances and the Group’s historical experience. Factors that may have an impact
on current and deferred taxes include changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or
regulations, future levels of research and development spending and changes in pre-tax earnings.
Leases. Where the Group is the lessee, key judgements include assessing whether arrangements contain a lease and
determining the lease term. To assess whether a contract contains a lease requires judgement about whether it depends on
a specified asset, whether the Group obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset, and whether
the Group has a right to direct the use of the asset. In order to determine the lease term judgement is required as extension
and termination options have to be assessed along with all facts and circumstances that may create an economic incentive
to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Estimates include calculating the discount rate which is
based on the incremental borrowing rate. At 31 December 2020 the Group has CHF 1,112 million in right-of-use assets and
CHF 1,195 million in lease liabilities (see Note 28).
Where the Group is the lessor, the treatment of leasing transactions is mainly determined by whether the lease is considered
to be an operating or finance lease. In making this assessment, management looks at the substance of the lease, as well as
the legal form, and makes a judgement about whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred.
Arrangements which do not take the legal form of a lease but that nevertheless convey the right to use an asset are also
covered by such assessments.
Consolidation. The Group periodically undertakes transactions that may involve obtaining control or significant influence over
other companies. These transactions include equity acquisitions, asset purchases and alliance agreements. In all such
cases management makes an assessment as to whether the Group has control or significant influence over the other company,
and whether it should be consolidated as a subsidiary or accounted for as an associated company. In making this assessment,
management considers the underlying economic substance of the transaction in addition to the contractual terms.
Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
The Group has assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecast financial information taking
into account the potential future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The accounting matters assessed included, but were
not limited to, the Group’s provisions for product returns, allowances for doubtful accounts for trade and lease receivables,
inventory allowances, the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and defined benefit
pension plan assets and liabilities. Any continued negative impacts from the pandemic in 2021 may have an impact on these,
or other, matters.
Bad debt expenses and overdue receivables remained at relatively low levels. There were no significant costs for idle
manufacturing capacity or inventory write-offs that could be directly attributed to COVID-19 factors, and only minor additional
COVID-19-related costs were incurred on construction projects.
Intangible asset impairment charges of CHF 342 million were incurred as a result of a delay in clinical trials, partly caused
by COVID-19, for the Spark Therapeutics’ haemophilia A programme (see Note 10). No other impairment issues were noted for
goodwill and intangible assets that can be directly attributed to the pandemic.
No impairment issues that can be directly attributed to the pandemic were noted for financial assets, although the volatility in
global markets had a corresponding impact on the carrying value of equity investments held at fair value. Similarly, there was a
certain volatility in the fair value of pension assets and discount rates during the first half of 2020, but the situation had largely
stabilised by the end of the year, and no exceptional funding payments to the Group’s pension plans are currently foreseen.
While there was no significant impact from the areas assessed on the Group’s Annual Financial Statements, the Group will
continue to monitor these areas of increased judgements and risk for material changes.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 57

Government and regulatory mandatory price reductions. These consist of mandatory price reductions. The major elements
are the 340B Drug Discount Program, Medicaid, and other plans in the US, which totalled USD 5.5 billion, equivalent to
CHF 5.2 billion (2019: USD 5.7 billion, equivalent to CHF 5.7 billion).
Contractual price reductions. These include rebates and chargebacks that are the result of contractual agreements that are
primarily volume based and performance based.
Cash discounts. These include credits offered to wholesalers for remitting payment on their purchases within contractually
defined incentive periods.
Customer returns reserves. These are allowances established for expected product returns.
Sales reductions that are expected to be withheld by the customer upon settlement, such as contractual price reductions and
cash discounts, are recorded in the balance sheet as a deduction from trade receivables (see Note 12). Sales reductions that
are separately payable to customers, governmental health authorities or healthcare regulatory authorities are recorded in
the balance sheet as accrued liabilities (see Note 19). Provisions for sales returns are recorded in the balance sheet as other
provisions (see Note 20).

Revenue recognised in relation to performance obligations satisfied in previous years
In 2020 there was an increase in revenue recognised of CHF 94 million (2019: increase of CHF 199 million) relating to
performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods, mainly due to adjustments of sales deduction provisions and
accruals for expected sales returns, chargebacks and other allowances in respect of previous years.
Remaining performance obligations in (partially) unsatisfied long-term contracts
Remaining performance obligations in (partially) unsatisfied long-term contracts are either included in deferred income or are
related to amounts the Group expects to receive for goods and services that have not yet been transferred to customers under
existing, non-cancellable or otherwise enforceable contracts. These are mainly associated with contracts in the Diagnostics
Division that have minimum purchase commitments related to reagents and consumables for previously sold instruments as well
as monitoring and maintenance services. For contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, the Group has elected
the practical expedient to not disclose the transaction price for remaining performance obligations at the end of each reporting
period and at which point in time the Group expects to recognise these sales.

Hyperinflationary economies
Since 1 July 2018 the Group has considered Argentina to be a hyperinflationary economy, in the context of IAS 29 ‘Financial
Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies’. The cumulative inflation index over the last three years exceeds 100%, as measured
by the National Wholesaler Price Index (Sistema de Índices de Precios Mayoristas).
Accordingly the Group has reviewed the reporting from its affiliates in Argentina, and where necessary restated them in line
with IAS 29. The potential adjustments resulting from the application of IAS 29 do not have a significant impact on the Group’s
operating results and balance sheet. An adjustment is recorded for the gains (losses) on the net monetary position, which is
a loss of CHF 14 million resulting from the loss in purchasing power of the positive net monetary position during 2020 of the
Group’s Argentinian affiliates (2019: loss of CHF 17 million).

Since the Group operates internationally, it is subject to income taxes in many different tax jurisdictions. The Group calculates
its average expected tax rate as a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
This rate changes from year to year due to changes in the mix of the Group’s taxable income and changes in local tax rates.
The Group’s average expected tax rate was stable at 18.8% in 2020 (2019: 18.9%). During 2020 there were no significant
changes to local tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The Group’s effective tax rate increased to 16.1% in 2020 (2019: 15.1%). This was mainly due to the lower effect from the
resolution of several tax disputes in 2020 compared to 2019. The transitional effect in 2019 of the Swiss tax reform and the
impairments of goodwill that are not tax deductible also impacted the effective tax rate.
The Group’s effective tax rate can be reconciled to the Group’s average expected tax rate as follows:

The income tax benefit recorded in respect of equity compensation plans, which varies according to the price of the underlying
equity, was CHF 132 million (2019: CHF 193 million). Had the income tax benefits been recorded solely on the basis of the IFRS 2
expense multiplied by the applicable tax rate, then a benefit of approximately CHF 124 million (2019: CHF 99 million) would have
been recorded.

As disclosed in Note 6, the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) at 31 December 2019 have been restated following the finalisation of the valuation of the net assets acquired
related to the Spark Therapeutics acquisition in 2019. A reconciliation to the previously published net deferred tax assets (liabilities) is provided in Note 6.
The deferred tax net assets for other temporary differences mainly relate to accrued and other liabilities, including lease
liabilities, provisions and unrealised profit in inventory.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward only to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit is
probable. The Group has unrecognised tax losses, including valuation allowances, as follows:
Unrecognised tax losses: expiry
2020 2019
Amount Applicable Amount Applicable

More than five years 7,802 7% 14,763 6%
Total unrecognised tax losses 11,023 9% 17,644 7%
The ‘More than five years’ category includes losses that cannot be used for US state income tax purposes in those states which
only permit tax reporting on a separate entity basis.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been established for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the remittance
of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, where such amounts are currently regarded as permanently reinvested for the purpose of
these financial statements. The total unremitted earnings of the Group, regarded as permanently reinvested for the purpose of
these financial statements, were CHF 40.6 billion at 31 December 2020 (2019: CHF 38.1 billion).Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 69
6. Mergers and acquisitions
This note includes both transactions accounted for as business combinations and asset acquisitions. Asset acquisitions are
acquisitions of legal entities that do not qualify as business combinations under IFRS 3 and include those acquisitions where
the value in these acquired companies largely consists of the rights to a single product or technology. Cash consideration paid
for asset acquisitions at the transaction date and subsequent additional contingent payments made upon the achievement
of performance-related development milestones are presented in the line ‘Asset acquisitions’ as disclosed separately below.
Subsequent consideration for performance-related development milestones for transactions treated as asset acquisitions is
recognised as intangible assets when the specific milestones have been achieved.
Business combinations – 2020
The Group did not complete any business combinations in 2020.
Business combinations – 2019
Spark Therapeutics, Inc. On 17 December 2019 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Spark Therapeutics, Inc.
(‘Spark Therapeutics’), a publicly owned US company based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that had been listed on Nasdaq.
Spark Therapeutics is a fully integrated commercial company committed to discovering, developing and delivering gene
therapies. Spark Therapeutics is reported in the Pharmaceuticals Division as part of the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating
segment. The total consideration was USD 4,772 million, which was paid in cash.
In the 2019 Annual Financial Statements the accounting for the Spark Therapeutics acquisition was provisional based on
preliminary information because the transaction closed shortly before 31 December 2019. The identification and valuation of
intangible assets, other assets and liabilities were finalised in 2020. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
are set out in the table below.

Intangible assets include Spark Therapeutics’ lead clinical asset SPK-8011, a novel gene therapy for the treatment of
haemophilia A, and Luxturna, Spark Therapeutics’ marketed gene therapy for the treatment of patients with confirmed biallelic
RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy (an inherited retinal disease). Luxturna was the first gene therapy to receive an
FDA approval in 2017. The European Commission granted marketing authorisation for Luxturna in 2018. Intangible assets also
include Spark Therapeutics’ other clinical and pre-clinical assets. The fair value of the intangible assets was determined using
an excess earning method that is based on management forecasts and observable market data for discount rates, tax rates
and foreign exchange rates. The present value was calculated using a risk-adjusted discount rate of 10.0%. The valuation was
performed by an independent valuer.
Goodwill represents Spark Therapeutics’ technological capabilities in gene therapy, such as gene therapy manufacturing,
adeno-associated viral vector engineering and immunology. Furthermore, goodwill represents a control premium, the acquired
work force and the expected synergies, notably in the areas of research and development as well as commercialisation of gene
therapies. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The Spark Therapeutics accounts receivable was comprised of gross contractual amounts due of CHF 12 million which were all
expected to be collectable at the date of the acquisition.
Directly attributable transaction costs of CHF 25 million were reported in the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment within
general and administration expenses.
The impact of the acquisition on the 2019 results for the Pharmaceuticals Division and the Group were not material. If the
acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2019 management estimates that Spark Therapeutics would have contributed revenue
of approximately CHF 80 million and a net loss (after tax) of approximately CHF 450 million in 2019. This information is provided
for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have occurred
had Spark Therapeutics actually been acquired at the beginning of the year, or indicative of the future results of the combined
Group.

intangible assets, other assets and liabilities were finalised in 2020 and as a result the comparative balance sheet information
at 31 December 2019 has been restated. The reconciliation between the balance sheet and the net assets acquired published
previously for 2019 (using provisional acquisition accounting) and the restated amounts which are reported as comparatives

Cash-generating units used for allocating goodwill
Pharmaceuticals Division. The basis for the use of the cash-generating units for allocating goodwill in the Pharmaceuticals
Division is as follows:
• Within the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment, goodwill arises from three broad types of transactions:
– Strategic transactions that have a transformative effect across the whole division.
– Technology transactions, where the acquired technologies can have a range of areas of applications.
– Product transactions, where the acquired products typically have more limited synergistic benefits outside of the immediate
product therapeutic area.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from strategic transactions is the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from technology transactions is also the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating
segment. However, if the acquired technologies permanently cease to operate then this will be treated as a disposal of the
business; in such cases the goodwill will be deemed to have been disposed of and will be fully impaired.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from product transactions is the smallest identifiable group of assets related
to the revenues and related costs that arise from the development and commercialisation of the product(s) in question. Where
there are synergistic benefits to other products in the same therapeutic area, then the revenues, costs and corresponding
assets of these other products are also taken into account. If the acquired products permanently cease to generate
economic benefits then this will be treated as a disposal of the business; in such cases the goodwill will be deemed to have
been disposed of and will be fully impaired.
• Chugai is a separate operating segment in the Group’s financial reporting and a separate cash-generating unit to which
goodwill is allocated.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 79
The Group allocated the goodwill in the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment as listed below.
• Strategic transactions consist of Genentech (1990/1999), Foundation Medicine (2015), Flatiron Health (2018) and Spark
Therapeutics (2019).
• Technology transactions consist of Therapeutic Human Polyclonals (2007), Dutalys (2014) and Santaris (2014).
• Product transactions consist of GlycArt (2005) and Tanox (2007).
Diagnostics Division. During 2020 the Group made a comprehensive reassessment of the cash-generating units used for
allocating goodwill in the Diagnostics Division. This reassessment was made in light of the following factors:
• Business transformations within the Diagnostics Division during 2020, notably the organisation changes announced in the
second half of 2020.
• Business development activities in the Diagnostics Information Solutions area.
• Ongoing reprioritisation of business activities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and other developments in the wider
diagnostics business.
The conclusions of this reassessment were as follows:
• Within the Diagnostics Division, goodwill arises from three broad types of transactions:
– Strategic transactions that have a transformative effect across the whole division.
– Technology transactions, where the acquired technologies can have a range of areas of applications.
– Product transactions, where the acquired products either have synergistic benefits across the wider business or where they
have more limited synergistic benefits outside of the immediate product therapeutic area.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from strategic transactions will be the Diagnostics Division.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from technology transactions will be either the Diagnostics customer
areas or the Diabetes Care customer area. However, if the acquired technologies permanently cease to operate then this
will be treated as a disposal of the business; in such cases the goodwill will be deemed to have been disposed of and will
be fully impaired.
• The cash-generating unit for the goodwill arising from product transactions will be the smallest identifiable group of
assets related to the revenues and related costs that arise from the development and commercialisation of the product(s)
in question. Where there are synergistic benefits to other products in the same business, then the revenues, costs and
corresponding assets of these other products will also be taken into account and the cash-generating unit will be either the
Diagnostics customer areas or the Diabetes Care customer area. If the acquired products permanently cease to generate
economic benefits then this will be treated as a disposal of the business; in such cases the goodwill will be deemed to have
been disposed of and will be fully impaired.
Based on the above reassessment the Group allocated the remaining goodwill in the Roche Diagnostics operating segment as
listed below. The basis for the reallocation were the historical amounts of goodwill that arose from the individual transactions.
• Strategic transactions consist of Corange/Boehringer Mannheim (1997).
• Technology transactions consist of Viewics (2017) in the Diagnostics customer areas and mySugr (2017) in the Diabetes Care
customer area.
• Product transactions in the Diagnostics customer areas consist of AVL Medical Instruments (2000), Igen (2004), BioVeris (2007),
Ventana (2008), PVT (2011), IQuum (2014) and GeneWeave Biosciences (2015).
• Product transactions in the Diabetes Care customer area consist of Disetronic (2003) and Medingo (2010).
Impairment charge – 2020
Diagnostics Division. The assessment for the potential impairment of goodwill in the Diagnostics Division was carried out using
the cash generating units as set out above. During 2020 impairment charges totalling CHF 247 million were recorded in the
Diagnostics Division.
AVL Medical Instruments acquisition. A charge of CHF 169 million was recorded for the full write-off of goodwill from the
AVL Medical Instruments acquisition made in 2000. When acquired, AVL Medical Instruments was a leading supplier of blood
gas and electrolyte analysers for point-of-care testing. The blood gas is currently loss-making and is expected to continue to
be loss-making according to the latest business plans. The Diagnostics customer areas business is developing a replacement
product and is planning substantial research and development investments in this area. The knowledge around the blood-gas
business and the synergies gained from AVL Medical Instruments acquisition, reflected in the current goodwill amount, will only
play a very minor incidental role in the future Diagnostics customer areas strategy and the development of the next-generation
product. Accordingly the goodwill is deemed to have been disposed of and has been fully impaired. The intangible assets
relating to this acquisition have been fully amortised in previous years.80 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020
GeneWeave Biosciences acquisition. A charge of CHF 78 million was recorded for the full write-off of goodwill from the
GeneWeave Biosciences acquisition made in 2015. When acquired, GeneWeave Biosciences focused on advancing clinical
microbiology with diagnostic solutions supporting healthcare providers in the fight against drug-resistant bacteria. At the
acquisition date product intangible assets, not available for use, totalling CHF 412 million were recorded. Impairment charges
were recorded in 2017 and 2019 to fully write off these intangible assets. The factors leading to these impairments were a
decrease in forecasted cash flows following a change in the timelines for future product development, pricing and penetration
rate due to updated market size assumptions, and further updated assumptions on timelines, research and development
expenses and production costs. During 2020 the timelines have been further delayed, in part due to a reprioritisation of
resources to COVID-19-related projects. It is currently unclear when and whether there will be any future revenues to support
the carrying value of the goodwill, and any synergistic benefits to other products in the same business would be incidental.
Accordingly the goodwill is deemed to have been disposed of and has been fully impaired.
Impairment charge – 2019
A charge of CHF 779 million was recorded in the Diagnostics Division for the partial write-off of goodwill related to the
Diabetes Care business. The impairment was a result of revised market assumptions related to the blood glucose monitoring
area and a slower than expected growth in other parts of this business.
Value in use
Value in use is calculated using a discounted expected cash flow approach, with a post-tax discount rate applied to the projected
risk-adjusted post-tax cash flows and terminal value. The discount rate is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital as the
cash-generating units have integrated operations across large parts of the Group. It is derived from a capital asset pricing model
using data from capital markets, including government twenty-year bonds. For assessing value in use, the cash flow projections
are based on the most recent long-term forecasts approved by management. The long-term forecasts include management’s
latest estimates on sales volume and pricing, as well as production and other operating costs and assume no significant changes
in the organisation. Other key assumptions used in the calculations are the period of cash flow projections included in the
long-term forecasts, the terminal value growth rate and the discount rate.
Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations
2020 2019
Period of Terminal Period of Terminal

Pharmaceuticals Division 5 years n/a 6.5% 5 years n/a 7.4%
Diagnostics Division 5 years 1.5% 6.5% 5 years 1.5% 7.4%
For cash-generating units with a terminal value growth, the respective rate does not exceed the long-term projected growth
rate for the relevant market.
Fair value less costs of disposal
For goodwill arising from the Chugai acquisition, the fair value less costs of disposal is determined with reference to the publicly
quoted price of Chugai shares.
Sensitivity analysis
Management has performed sensitivity analyses for Roche Pharmaceuticals and the Diagnostics Division, which increased the
discount rate by 1% combined with decreasing the forecast cash flows by 5%, and for Chugai, which decreased the publicly
quoted share prices by 5%. The results of the sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the above changes in the key assumptions
would not cause the carrying values of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amounts at 31 December 2020.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 81

Internally generated intangible assets
At 31 December 2020 commercial software intangible assets amounted to CHF 6 million (2019: nil) and are included in other
intangibles. Other than that the Group has no internally generated intangible assets from development as the criteria for the
recognition as an asset are not met.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
The Group currently has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Intangible assets not available for use
These mostly represent in-process research and development assets acquired either through in-licensing arrangements,
business combinations, asset acquisitions or separate purchases. At 31 December 2020 approximately 70% (2019: 70%) of
the projects in the Pharmaceuticals Division have known decision points within the next twelve months which in certain
circumstances could lead to impairment. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the research and development processes,
intangible assets not available for use are particularly at risk of impairment if the project is not expected to result in a
commercialised product.
Intangible asset impairment
Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposal. Factors such as the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence or
lower-than-anticipated sales for products with capitalised rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
Impairment charges – 2020
Pharmaceuticals Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 425 million were recorded. The major items related to:
• A charge of CHF 342 million for the partial impairment of the intangible asset for SPK-8011, a novel gene therapy for the
treatment of haemophilia A, acquired as part of the Spark Therapeutics acquisition. This impairment was a result of a delay
in clinical trials, partly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to reduced sales expectations. The asset concerned,
which was not yet being amortised, was written down to its estimated recoverable amount of CHF 985 million.
• A charge of CHF 81 million for the partial impairment of the intangible asset for Luxturna, a marketed gene therapy for the
treatment of patients with inherited retinal disease due to mutations in both copies of the RPE65 gene, which was acquired as
part of the Spark Therapeutics acquisition. This impairment was a result of reduced sales expectations. The asset concerned
was written down to its estimated recoverable amount of CHF 287 million. The intangible asset continues to be amortised
over its remaining estimated useful life of 8 years.
Impairment charges – 2019
Pharmaceuticals Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 633 million were recorded. The major items related to:
• A charge of CHF 168 million for the full impairment of a compound purchased separately, driven by a change in the
development plan. The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 137 million following clinical data assessment of two compounds. The assets concerned, which were not yet
being amortised, were fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 125 million due to the decision to stop the development of a compound with an alliance partner. The asset
concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 78 million for the partial impairment of a compound developed together with an alliance partner, mainly
driven by reduced revenue forecasts. The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was partially written down.
• A charge of CHF 60 million due to the decision to stop the development of a compound and the related collaboration
activities with an alliance partner. The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 59 million due to the decision to stop the development of a compound purchased separately. The asset
concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.84 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020
Diagnostics Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 344 million were recorded which related to:
• A charge of CHF 259 million for the impairment of Molecular Diagnostics product intangibles in use acquired as part of the
GeneWeave acquisition. The main factors leading to this were updated assumptions on timelines, research and development
expenses and production costs. The asset concerned, which was being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 85 million for the impairment of sequencing business product intangibles in use acquired as part of the
Ariosa acquisition mainly due to a change in timelines for the launch of related sequencing products. The asset concerned,
which was being amortised, was fully written down.
Potential commitments from alliance collaborations and purchase agreements within the next three years
The Group is party to in-licensing and similar arrangements with its alliance partners and intangible asset purchase agreements
with third parties, including asset acquisitions. These arrangements and purchase agreements may require the Group to make
certain milestone or other similar payments dependent upon the achievement of agreed objectives or performance targets as
defined in the collaboration and purchase agreements.
The Group’s current estimate of future third-party commitments for such payments within the next three years is set out in the
table below. These figures are undiscounted and are not risk-adjusted, meaning that they include all such potential payments
that can arise assuming all projects currently in development are successful. The timing is based on the Group’s current best
estimate. These figures do not include any potential commitments within the Group, such as may arise between the Roche and
Chugai businesses.

In 2020 CHF 1,401 million of provisions were utilised (2019: CHF 1,003 million), of which CHF 1,390 million (2019: CHF 828 million)
are included in the cash flows from operating activities and CHF 11 million (2019: CHF 175 million) are included in the cash flows
from business combinations for payments made from deferred and contingent consideration arrangements (see Note 6).90 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020
Legal provisions
Legal provisions consist of a number of separate legal matters, including claims arising from trade, in various Group companies.
By their nature the amounts and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict.
As part of the regular review of litigation matters, management has reassessed the provisions recorded for certain litigation
matters. Based on the development of the various litigations, notably the Accutane case in the US, some of the provisions
previously held were released which resulted in an income of CHF 423 million. This was a major element in the expenses for
legal cases in 2020, which show a net income of CHF 345 million included in general and administration (2019: net expenses
of CHF 422 million). Details of the major legal cases outstanding are disclosed below.
Environmental provisions
Provisions for environmental matters include various separate environmental issues in a number of countries. By their nature the
amounts and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict. Significant provisions are discounted by between 1% and 3% where
the time value of money is material. The significant provisions relate to the US site in Nutley, New Jersey, which was divested in
September 2016, the estimated remediation costs for a landfill site near Grenzach, Germany, that was used by manufacturing
operations that were closed some years ago and the estimated remediation costs for the manufacturing site at Clarecastle,
Ireland. In 2020 the net environmental expenses were nil (2019: net expense of CHF 59 million).
The Group’s procedures on environmental protection are included in the Annual Report on pages 94 to 101. These include the
actions taken by the Group with regard to climate change, notably the Group’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Restructuring provisions
These arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of business undertaken by the Group or the manner
in which business is conducted. Such provisions include only the costs necessarily entailed by the restructuring which are
not associated with the recurring activities of the Group. The timings of these cash outflows are reasonably certain. These
provisions are not discounted as the time value of money is not material in these matters.
In the Pharmaceuticals Division the significant provisions relate to the resourcing flexibility plans as well as to the redesign and
the strategic realignment of its manufacturing network. In the Diagnostics Division the significant provisions are associated
with programmes to address long-term strategy, while in Corporate they relate to initiatives for the outsourcing of operational
activities to the global shared service centres and external providers. Further details are given in Note 7.
Contingent consideration provisions
The Group is party to certain contingent consideration arrangements arising from business combinations. Significant provisions
are discounted using an average discount rate of 2.1% (2019: 3.0%) where the time value of money is material. Additional details
on measurement and on the total potential payments under these arrangements are provided in Note 31.
Other provisions
Other provisions relate to the items shown in the table below. With the exception of employee provisions, the timing of cash
outflows is by its nature uncertain.

At 31 December 2019 and 2018 other items included provisions that had previously been recorded for the estimated amount of
a potential obligation for past royalties relating to the PDL-1 inhibitor litigation described below. In November 2020 a settlement
agreement was reached for this dispute and the agreed cash settlement was recorded against these provisions.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 91
Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees, to be affected by political,
legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating to environmental protection, in the countries in which it
operates. The industries in which the Group operates are also subject to other risks of various kinds. The nature and frequency
of these developments and events, not all of which are covered by insurance, as well as their effect on future operations and
earnings, are not predictable.
The Group has entered into strategic alliances with various companies in order to gain access to potential new products or
to utilise other companies to help develop the Group’s own potential new products. Potential future payments may become
due to certain collaboration partners achieving certain milestones as defined in the collaboration agreements. The Group’s
best estimates of future commitments for such payments are given in Note 10.
Legal cases
At 31 December 2020 provisions for legal cases were CHF 317 million (2019: CHF 803 million), mainly related to legal cases
in the Pharmaceuticals Division of CHF 53 million (2019: CHF 483 million) and in the Diagnostics Division of CHF 264 million
(2019: CHF 314 million). Provisions have been recorded, and in some cases settled, mainly relating to Meso, a Diagnostics legal
case, and to the Pharmaceuticals legal matters listed below.
Accutane. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (‘HLR’) and various other Roche affiliates have been named as defendants in numerous
legal actions in the US and elsewhere relating to the acne medication Accutane. The litigation alleges that Accutane caused
certain serious conditions, including, but not limited to, inflammatory bowel disease (‘IBD’), birth defects and psychiatric
disorders. In 2009 HLR announced that, following a re-evaluation of the portfolio of medicines that are now available from
generic manufacturers, rapidly declining brand sales in the US and high costs from personal-injury lawsuits that it continues
to defend vigorously, it had decided to immediately discontinue the manufacture and distribution of the product in the US.
All of the actions pending in federal court alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation
(‘MDL’) in the US District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division. In August 2015 the MDL was closed. During
the pendency of the MDL the District Court granted summary judgment in favour of HLR for all of the federal IBD cases that
had proceeded and all were affirmed by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. All of the actions pending in state
court in New Jersey alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division,
Atlantic County.
In February 2015 the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County, held an eight-day evidentiary hearing on
whether plaintiffs’ experts can testify that Accutane causes Crohn’s disease. On 20 February 2015 the Superior Court barred
plaintiffs’ experts because their methods did not meet the requirements for scientific reliability. On 8 May 2015 the Superior
Court entered an order dismissing with prejudice an agreed-upon list of 2,076 Crohn’s disease cases that were subject to the
Superior Court’s February 2015 order. On 28 July 2017 the New Jersey Appellate Division reversed the order excluding
plaintiffs’ experts from testifying that Accutane causes Crohn’s disease and reinstated the dismissed cases finding that the trial
court wrongfully barred plaintiffs’ expert witnesses. HLR filed a petition for review to the New Jersey Supreme Court, which was
granted on 8 December 2017. On 1 August 2018 the Supreme Court issued its decision on whether plaintiffs’ experts can testify
that Accutane causes Crohn’s disease. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the New Jersey Appellate Division and
concluded that the trial court properly had excluded the experts thereby dismissing 2,174 cases alleging that Accutane caused
plaintiffs’ Crohn’s disease. Plaintiffs cannot further appeal. All 2,174 Crohn’s disease cases were permanently dismissed.
On 12 May 2015 the Superior Court entered an order granting summary judgment and dismissing 18 cases filed by New Jersey
residents on the basis that the drug label was adequate as a matter of law since 2002. In July 2015 the Superior Court granted
HLR’s motion for summary judgment as to the adequacy of the label for post-2002 ingestion cases in 44 other jurisdictions.
The Superior Court applied New Jersey law to all of the jurisdictions and granted HLR’s motion dismissing approximately
511 cases. In the alternative, the Superior Court applied the home state law and granted summary judgment in 24 jurisdictions
and denied it in 20 jurisdictions; this would have resulted in 389 cases being dismissed. On 25 July 2017 the New Jersey
Appellate Division affirmed the dismissal of 197 cases and reinstated judgments in 335 cases based on the strength of HLR’s
warnings after 2002. HLR and the dismissed plaintiffs filed petitions for review to the New Jersey Supreme Court, which was
granted on 8 December 2017. On 3 October 2018 the Supreme Court issued its decision on those cases and reversed the
judgment of the New Jersey Appellate Division that had reinstated 335 cases on the basis that the drug label was adequate as
a matter of law since 2002. Plaintiffs cannot further appeal. 532 cases were permanently dismissed.92 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020
In January and October 2016 the Superior Court entered orders granting summary judgment and dismissing 191 cases for
failure to prove Accutane proximately caused their ulcerative colitis. The plaintiffs appealed all of these decisions. During
February and March 2017 the Superior Court held an evidentiary hearing on whether plaintiffs’ experts can testify that
Accutane causes ulcerative colitis. In April 2017 the Superior Court barred plaintiffs’ experts because their methods did not
meet the requirements for scientific reliability. In May 2017 the Superior Court entered an order dismissing 3,231 ulcerative
colitis cases that were subject to the Superior Court’s April 2017 order. The plaintiffs appealed these decisions.
At 31 December 2019 HLR was defending no pending actions and there were approximately 3,422 cases on appeal. After a
hearing on 7 January 2020, on 17 January 2020 the New Jersey Appellate Division issued its decision on whether plaintiffs’
experts can testify that Accutane causes ulcerative colitis. It affirmed the trial court’s ruling and concluded that the trial court
properly had excluded the experts thereby dismissing cases alleging that Accutane caused plaintiffs’ ulcerative colitis. The
plaintiffs filed a petition for appeal to the New Jersey Supreme Court. On 8 May 2020 the Supreme Court entered an order
denying the petition. Plaintiffs cannot further appeal. All remaining cases were permanently dismissed. The Supreme Court had
dismissed previously other cases in 2018. With this the matter in the US is now concluded.
Avastin/Lucentis investigations. On 14 February 2013 the Italian Antitrust Authority (‘AGCM’) announced an investigation
to determine whether Roche, Genentech and Novartis had entered into an agreement to restrict competition in the Italian
market for drugs, with reference in particular to Avastin (marketed by Roche) and Lucentis (marketed by Novartis). Avastin
and Lucentis are two different drugs that were developed and approved for different therapeutic purposes and contain
different active pharmaceutical ingredients. On 5 March 2014 the AGCM issued a verdict that alleges that Roche and Novartis
colluded to artificially differentiate Avastin and Lucentis in order to foster the sales of Lucentis in Italy. The AGCM fined Roche
EUR 90.5 million and Novartis EUR 92 million. Roche appealed the AGCM verdict to the Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale
del Lazio (‘TAR’). On 2 December 2014 the TAR upheld the decision by the AGCM. Roche appealed the verdict of the TAR to
the Consiglio di Stato. In July 2014 Roche paid the EUR 90.5 million fine under protest to avoid additional penalty fees and
recorded an expense within general and administration. On 23 January 2018 the European Court of Justice rendered its
decision on five questions which were referred to the European Court of Justice by the Consiglio di Stato. On 15 July 2019
the Consiglio di Stato issued the final verdict on the case and upheld the verdicts of both the AGCM and the TAR. With respect
to the fine of the AGCM, this matter is now concluded. The Italian Ministry of Health and some Italian regions notified the
Group of their intention to seek damages related to this matter. On 24 January 2019 the French Competition Authority (‘FCA’)
issued a Statement of Objections against Roche, Genentech and Novartis regarding anticompetitive practices concerning
the commercialisation of Avastin and Lucentis in France. The FCA alleges that Roche, Genentech and Novartis abused their
collective dominant position on the French market for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration between
2008 and 2013. On 9 September 2020 the FCA issued a decision finding that Roche, Genentech and Novartis had infringed
competition law and imposed a fine of EUR 60 million against Roche and Genentech. Roche and Genentech appealed this
decision. At 31 December 2020 a liability was held for the amount of the fine, which is included in accounts payable within the
line item other payables (see Note 17). The fine will be paid under protest to avoid additional penalty fees and will be due not
later than 15 February 2021. In addition the Group is challenging policies and regulations allowing off-label/unlicensed use
and reimbursement for economic reasons in various countries. The Group is vigorously defending itself in these matters. The
outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 93
PDL-1 inhibitor litigation. On 26 July 2017 Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (‘BMS’) filed a lawsuit against Genentech, Inc. (‘Genentech’)
in Delaware, US. BMS alleges that Genentech’s sale of Tecentriq infringes their US Patent No. 9,402,899. BMS is seeking
judgment in its favour, a finding of wilfulness and monetary damages. On 4 October 2017 Genentech filed its answer and
counterclaims, seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity of the 9,402,899 patent. In May 2019 BMS and Genentech agreed
to drop the lawsuit without prejudice to the case being refiled at a later date. In November 2020 BMS and Genentech reached
a settlement agreement for this dispute. Under the terms of the agreement, the two parties concluded a royalty agreement for
future worldwide sales of Tecentriq and Genentech made a cash settlement for past royalties. Provisions had previously been
recorded for the estimated amount of this potential obligation for past royalties, and the agreed cash settlement was recorded
against these provisions. The matter is now concluded.
Average Wholesale Prices litigation. HLR and Roche Laboratories Inc. (‘RLI’), along with approximately 50 other brand and
generic pharmaceutical companies, have been named as defendants in several legal actions in the US relating to the pricing of
pharmaceutical drugs and State Medicaid reimbursement. The primary allegation in these litigations is that the pharmaceutical
companies misrepresented or otherwise reported inaccurate Average Wholesale Prices (‘AWP’) and/or Wholesale Acquisition
Costs (‘WAC’) for their drugs, which prices were allegedly relied upon by the states in calculating Medicaid reimbursements to
entities such as retail pharmacies. The states, through their respective Attorney General, are seeking repayment of the amounts
they claim were over-reimbursed. The time period associated with these cases is 1991 through 2005. At 31 December 2020
HLR and RLI are defending one AWP action filed in the state of New Jersey. HLR and RLI are vigorously defending themselves
and no trial date has been set. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Boniva litigation. HLR, Genentech and various other Roche affiliates (collectively ‘Roche’) have been named as defendants
in numerous legal actions in the US and one now dismissed case in Canada relating to the post-menopausal osteoporosis
medication Boniva. In these litigations, the plaintiffs allege that Boniva caused either osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypical
femoral fractures. At 31 December 2020 Roche is defending approximately 250 actions involving approximately 290 plaintiffs
brought in federal and state courts throughout the US for personal injuries allegedly resulting from the use of Boniva. All of
these cases are in the early discovery stages of litigation. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including many
that are unique to the particular case. Roche is vigorously defending itself in these matters. The outcome of these matters
cannot be determined at this time.
Meso litigation. In February 2017 Roche Diagnostics Corporation (‘Roche’) filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the District
of Delaware against Meso Scale Diagnostics, LLC (‘Meso’). This is a patent infringement case involving certain US patents
owned by BioVeris Corporation (‘BioVeris’), a company acquired by the Group in 2007. Meso holds a limited exclusive licence to
use certain aspects of the electrochemiluminescence (‘ECL’) detection technology. Roche and Meso disagree on the scope
of the licence. The lawsuit is seeking a declaratory judgment to get judicial clarification that Roche is not infringing Meso’s
licence. On 25 November 2019 the jury found that Roche’s use of the patents infringed the scope of Meso’s licence. There was
no injunction granted and the jury awarded Meso USD 137 million in damages. In 2020 post-trial motions were filed by both
parties and Meso moved for enhancement, pre-judgment interest and post-judgment royalties. The court hearing took place
on 6 May 2020. On 23 December 2020 the US District Court issued the final order of judgment in which the jury award was
confirmed and Meso’s request for enhanced damages was denied. The Group will appeal this decision.
In addition, the Pharmaceuticals legal cases listed below do not currently have provisions recorded, but there are potential
future obligations which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events or where the
obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.94 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020
Hemlibra litigation. On 4 May 2017 Baxalta Inc. and Baxalta GmbH (both together ‘Baxalta’), subsidiaries of Takeda
Pharmaceutical Company Limited, filed a patent infringement and declaratory judgment of patent infringement suit in the
US District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that Genentech and Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (‘Chugai’)
currently or imminently would manufacture, use, sell, offer for sale, or import into the US Hemlibra, which would infringe
Baxalta’s US Patent No. 7,033,590. Baxalta is seeking a judgment of infringement, injunctive and monetary relief, attorneys’
fees, costs and expenses. On 11 May 2017 Genentech was served with the complaint. Genentech’s response and
counterclaims to the complaint were filed on 30 June 2017. On 19 June 2017 Chugai waived service. On 13 September 2017
Chugai filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. On 14 December 2017 Baxalta filed a request
for a preliminary injunction against Genentech only, in which some inhibitor patients would not be subject to any injunction.
A hearing was held in the US District Court for the District of Delaware on 13 and 14 June 2018 and during that hearing Baxalta
withdrew its request for a preliminary injunction as to the inhibitor patients. On 25 June 2018 Baxalta submitted a new proposed
preliminary injunction order, in which Genentech would be permitted to sell Hemlibra to all inhibitor patients, all non-inhibitor
patients currently on Hemlibra whether through clinical trials or not, and selected non-inhibitor patients who have an additional
‘medically diagnosed condition’ which rendered factor VIII therapies impracticable. On 7 August 2018 the US District Court
ruled against Baxalta, denying their request for an injunction. On 19 September 2018 Chugai was dismissed from this case.
On 1 February 2019 the US District Court issued a final judgment in favour of Genentech stating that Hemlibra does not infringe
Baxalta’s patent based on the Court’s definition of key terms related to the patent. On 8 February 2019 Baxalta appealed
this decision. On 27 August 2020 the Appeals Court reversed the claim construction ruling of the US District Court in favour
of Genentech and remanded the case back to the US District Court. The Group is vigorously defending itself in this matter.
The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
On 28 March 2018, in the case brought by Baxalta against Chugai in Japan, the Tokyo District Court ruled in favour of Chugai,
notably that Hemlibra does not infringe Baxalta’s patent. On 10 May 2018 Baxalta appealed this decision. On 3 October 2019
the Japanese Intellectual Property High Court issued a ruling upholding the Tokyo District Court’s decision. Baxalta has filed
an appeal with the Japanese Supreme Court. In August 2020 the Japanese Supreme Court decided not to accept Baxalta’s
final appeal. Therefore, the decision of the Japanese Intellectual Property High Court is now final. While Baxalta’s patent in
Japan is valid, it is not infringed by Hemlibra. All pending legal actions in Japan were terminated and the matter in Japan is now
concluded.
Iraqi Ministry of Health. In October 2017 F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (‘FHLR’), Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (‘HLR’) and Genentech
and certain other pharmaceutical and/or medical device companies were named as defendants in a complaint filed in the
Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, US, on behalf of US service-members and their relatives who allege that
they were killed or injured in Iraq between 2005 and 2009 (the ‘Iraq lawsuit’). The complaint alleges that the defendants
violated the US Anti-Terrorism Act and various state laws by providing funding for terrorist organisations through their sales
practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and/or medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health. In addition FHLR
received an inquiry in July 2018 from the US Department of Justice in connection with an anti-corruption investigation relating
to activities in Iraq, including interactions with the Iraqi government and certain of the same matters alleged in the Iraq lawsuit.
On 29 October 2019 the US Department of Justice closed its inquiry against FHLR. On 17 July 2020 the Federal District Court
granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss. The plaintiffs appealed this decision. The Group is vigorously defending itself in
this matter. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Tamiflu Qui tam litigation. In 2019, Roche Holding Ltd (‘Roche Holding’), Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. (‘HLR’) and Genentech, Inc.
(‘Genentech’) were served with a lawsuit filed by a relator in the US District Court for the District of Maryland under the qui
tam (whistleblower) provisions of the False Claims Act. The lawsuit was originally filed under seal years earlier on behalf of the
US government and various US state governments. The lawsuit alleges certain improper conduct by the Group with respect to
sales of Tamiflu to the US government and various US state governments. The US Department of Justice declined to intervene
in the lawsuit. On 17 January 2020 the Group filed a motion to dismiss. On 28 September 2020 the plaintiff dismissed the
complaint as to Roche Holding and Genentech and the District Court denied HLR’s motion for summary judgment. The Group
is vigorously defending itself in this matter. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 95

Genentech transaction
The Group completed the purchase of the non-controlling interests in Genentech effective 26 March 2009. Based on the
International Accounting Standard 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ (IAS 27) and consistent with the International Financial
Reporting Standard 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ (IFRS 10), which was adopted by the Group in 2013, this transaction
was accounted for in full as an equity transaction. As a consequence, the carrying amount of the consolidated equity of the
Group at that time was reduced by CHF 52.2 billion, of which CHF 8.5 billion was allocated to eliminate the book value of
Genentech non-controlling interests. This accounting effect significantly impacted the Group’s net equity, but has no effect on
the Group’s business or its dividend policy.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 101
Share capital
At 31 December 2020 the authorised and issued share capital of Roche Holding Ltd, which is the Group’s parent company,
consisted of 160 million shares with a nominal value of CHF 1.00 each, as in the preceding year. The shares are bearer
shares and the Group does not maintain a register of shareholders. Based on information supplied to the Group, a shareholder
group with pooled voting rights owns 45.01% (2019: 45.01%) of the issued shares. On 5 December 2019 the shareholder
group announced that it would continue the shareholder pooling agreement existing since 1948 with a modified shareholder
composition. The duration of the pool was extended for an indefinite period in 2009. The shareholder group with pooled voting
rights holds 72,018,000 shares, corresponding to 45.01% of the shares issued. This figure does not include any shares without
pooled voting rights that are held outside this group by individual members of the group. Ms Maja Oeri, formerly a member of the
pool, holds 8,091,900 shares representing 5.057% of the voting rights independently of the pool. This is further described in
Note 32. Based on information supplied to the Group, Novartis Holding AG, Basel, owns 33.333% (participation below 331⁄3%) of
the issued shares (2019: 33.333%).
Non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
At 31 December 2020 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities have been authorised and were in issue as in the preceding
year. Under Swiss company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value, are not part of the share capital and
cannot be issued against a contribution which would be shown as an asset in the balance sheet of Roche Holding Ltd.
Each non-voting equity security confers the same rights as any of the shares to participate in the net profit and any remaining
proceeds from liquidation following repayment of the nominal value of the shares and, if any, participation certificates.
In accordance with the law and the Articles of Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd, the Company is entitled at all times to
exchange all or some of the non-voting equity securities into shares or participation certificates.
Dividends
On 17 March 2020 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of CHF 9.00 per share and non-voting equity
security (2019: CHF 8.70) in respect of the 2019 business year. The distribution to holders of outstanding shares and non-voting
equity securities totalled CHF 7,700 million (2019: CHF 7,449 million) and has been recorded against retained earnings in 2020.
The Board of Directors has proposed dividends for the 2020 business year of CHF 9.10 per share and non-voting equity security
which, if approved, would result in a total distribution to shareholders of CHF 7,849 million. This is subject to approval at the
Annual General Meeting on 16 March 2021.

Reserves
Fair value reserve. At 31 December 2020 the fair value reserve represents the cumulative net change in the fair value of
financial assets at fair value through OCI until the asset is sold, impaired or otherwise disposed of.
Hedging reserve. The hedging reserve represents the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash
flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.

consolidation of Group companies that use functional currencies other than Swiss francs.102 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020
23. Subsidiaries
Chugai
Effective 1 October 2002 the Roche Group and Chugai completed an alliance to create a leading research-driven Japanese
pharmaceutical company, which was formed by the merger of Chugai and Roche’s Japanese pharmaceuticals subsidiary,
Nippon Roche. The merged company is known as Chugai.
Consolidated subsidiary. Chugai is a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group. This is based on the Group’s interest in Chugai
at 31 December 2020 of 61.2% (2019: 61.2%) and the Roche relationship with Chugai that is founded on the Basic Alliance,
Licensing and Research Collaboration Agreements.
The common stock of Chugai is publicly traded and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the stock code ‘TSE:4519’.
On 21 January 2020 Chugai announced a split of its common stock. Effective 1 July 2020 the number of issued shares has
increased from 559,685,889 to 1,679,057,667 (three-for-one split). Chugai prepares financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that are filed on a quarterly basis with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to
certain consolidation entries there are minor differences between Chugai’s stand-alone IFRS results and the results of Chugai
as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS.

to Roche are eliminated on consolidation as intercompany items.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 103
Roche’s relationship with Chugai. Chugai has entered into certain agreements with Roche, which are discussed below:
(1) Basic Alliance Agreement – As part of the Basic Alliance Agreement signed in December 2001, Roche and Chugai entered
into certain arrangements covering the future operation and governance of Chugai. Amongst other matters these cover the
following areas:
• The structuring of the alliance.
• Roche’s rights as a shareholder.
• Roche’s rights to nominate members of Chugai’s Board of Directors.
• Certain limitations to Roche’s ability to buy or sell Chugai’s common stock.
Chugai issues additional shares of common stock in connection with its convertible debt and equity compensation plans, and
may issue additional shares for other purposes, which affects Roche’s percentage ownership interest. The Basic Alliance
Agreement provides, amongst other matters, that Chugai will guarantee Roche’s right to maintain its shareholding percentage
in Chugai at not less than 50.1%.
(2) Licensing Agreements – Under the Japan Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in December 2001, Chugai has exclusive rights
to market Roche’s pharmaceutical products in Japan. Chugai has the right of first refusal on the development and marketing in
Japan of all development compounds advanced by Roche.
The Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement (excluding Japan and South Korea) signed in May 2002 was revised and
the Amended and Restated Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement (excluding Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) was
signed in August 2014. Under this Agreement Chugai shall offer and Roche has the right of first refusal on the development
and marketing of Chugai’s development compounds in markets outside Japan, excluding South Korea and Taiwan.
Further to these agreements, Roche and Chugai have signed a series of separate agreements for certain specific products.
Depending on the specific circumstances and the terms of the agreement, this may result in payments on an arm’s length basis
between Roche and Chugai, for any or all of the following matters:
• Upfront payments, if a right of first refusal to license a product is exercised.
• Milestone payments, dependent upon the achievement of agreed performance targets.
• Royalties on future product sales.
These specific product agreements may also cover the manufacture and supply of the respective products to meet the other
party’s clinical and/or commercial requirements on an arm’s length basis.

26. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group’s objective is to provide attractive and competitive post-employment benefits to employees, while at the same
time ensuring that the various plans are appropriately financed and managing any potential impacts on the Group’s long-term
financial position. Most employees are covered by pension plans sponsored by Group companies. The nature of such plans
varies according to legal regulations, fiscal requirements and market practice in the countries in which the employees
are employed. Post-employment benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation
to pay further contributions. All other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’.
Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans are funded through payments by employees and by the Group to funds administered by third parties.
The Group’s expenses for these plans were CHF 409 million (2019: CHF 410 million). No assets or liabilities are recognised in
the Group’s balance sheet in respect of such plans, apart from regular prepayments and accruals of the contributions withheld
from employees’ wages and salaries and of the Group’s contributions. The Group’s major defined contribution plan is the
US Roche 401(k) Savings Plan.
Defined benefit plans
Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by payments from Group companies and by
employees. In some cases, notably for the major defined benefit plans in Germany, the plans are unfunded and the Group pays
pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources. Plans are usually governed by a senior governing body,
such as a Board of Trustees, which is typically composed of both employee and employer representatives. Funding of these
plans is determined by local regulations using independent actuarial valuations. Separate independent actuarial valuations are
prepared in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 for use in the Group’s financial statements. The Group’s major pension
plans are located in Switzerland, the US and Germany, which in total account for 85% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation
(2019: 84%).106 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020
Pension plans in Switzerland. Current pension arrangements for employees in Switzerland are made through plans governed
by the Swiss Federal Occupational Old Age, Survivors and Disability Pension Act (‘BVG’). The Group’s pension plans are
administered by separate legal foundations, which are funded by regular employee and company contributions. The final
benefit is contribution based with certain minimum guarantees. Due to these minimum guarantees, the Swiss plans are
treated as defined benefit plans for the purposes of these IFRS financial statements, although they have many of the
characteristics of defined contribution plans. Where there is an underfunding, this may be remedied by various measures
such as increasing employee and company contributions, lowering the interest rate on retirement account balances, reducing
prospective benefits and a suspension of the early withdrawal facility.
Pension plans in the US. The Group’s major defined benefit plans in the US have been closed to new members since 2007.
New employees in the US now join the defined contribution plan. The largest of the remaining defined benefit plans are funded
pension plans together with smaller unfunded supplementary retirement plans. The benefits are based on the highest average
annual rate of earnings during a specified period and length of employment. The plans are non-contributory for employees,
with the Group making periodic payments to the plans. Where there is an underfunding, this would normally be remedied by
additional company contributions. In 2020 and 2019 no payments were made by the Group.
Pension plans in Germany. The Group’s major pension arrangements in Germany are governed by the Occupational Pensions
Act (‘BetrAVG’). These plans are unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial
resources. These plans are non-contributory for employees. The benefits are based on final salary and length of employment.
These plans have been closed to new members since 2007. They have been replaced by a new plan which is funded by regular
employee and company contributions and administered through a contractual trust agreement. The final benefit is contribution
based with a minimum guarantee. Due to this minimum guarantee, this plan is treated as a defined benefit plan for the purposes
of these IFRS financial statements, although it has many of the characteristics of a defined contribution plan.
Pension plans in the Rest of the World. These represent approximately 10% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation (2019: 11%)
and consist of a number of smaller plans in various countries. Of these the largest are the pension plans at Chugai, which
are independently managed by Chugai, and the main pension plan in the United Kingdom. In 2020 Chugai has made additional
voluntary contributions of JPY 2.3 billion to its pension plans (2019: JPY 9.0 billion). The Chugai plans are fully described in
Chugai’s own IFRS financial statements. The UK pension plan is funded by regular employee and company contributions, with
benefits based on final salary and length of employment. This plan has been closed to new members since 2003 and has
been replaced with a defined contribution plan.
Other post-employment benefit (‘OPEB’) plans. These represent approximately 5% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation
(2019: 5%) and consist of post-employment healthcare and life insurance schemes, mainly in the US. These plans are mainly
unfunded and/or are contributory for employees, with the Group reimbursing retired employees directly from its own financial
resources. The Group’s major OPEB plans in the US have been closed to new members since 2011. Part of the costs of these
plans is reimbursable under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. There is no statutory
funding requirement for these plans. The Group is funding these plans to the extent that it is tax efficient. In 2020 and 2019
no payments were made by the Group to these plans. At 31 December 2020 the IFRS funding status was 57% (2019: 50%),
including reimbursement rights, for the funded OPEB plans in the US.

Funding status
The funding of the Group’s various defined benefit plans is the responsibility of the respective senior governing body, such
as a Board of Trustees, and the sponsoring employer, and is managed based on local statutory valuations, which follow the
legislation and requirements of the respective jurisdiction in which the plan is established. Qualified independent actuaries
carry out statutory actuarial valuations on a regular basis. The actuarial assumptions determining the funding status on
the statutory basis are regularly assessed by the local senior governing body. The funding status is closely monitored at
a corporate level. The unfunded plans are mainly those in the Group’s German affiliates, where the fully reserved pension
obligations are used for self-financing of the local affiliate’s operations.
The IFRS funding status of the funded defined benefit plans increased to 94% (2019: 92%).
Reimbursement rights are linked to the post-employment medical plans in the US and represent the expected reimbursement of
the medical expenditure provided under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003.

Plan assets
The responsibility for the investment strategies of funded plans is with the respective senior governance body, such as the
Board of Trustees. Asset-liability studies are performed regularly for all major pension plans. These studies examine the
obligations from post-employment benefit plans, and evaluate various investment strategies with respect to key financial
measures such as expected returns, expected risks, expected contributions, and expected funded status of the plan in an
interdependent way. The goal of an asset-liability study is to select an appropriate asset allocation for the funds held within
the plan. The investment strategy is developed to optimise expected returns, to manage risks and to contain fluctuations
in the statutory funded status. Asset-liability studies include strategies to match the cash flows of the assets with the plan
obligations. The Group currently does not use longevity swaps to manage longevity risk.
Plan assets are managed using internal and external asset managers. The actual performance is continually monitored
by the pension fund governance bodies as well as being closely monitored at a corporate level. In these financial
statements the difference between the interest income and actual return on plan assets is a remeasurement that is
recorded directly to other comprehensive income. In 2020 the actual return on plan assets was a gain of CHF 1,452 million
(2019: gain of CHF 2,083 million), which excludes the actual return on reimbursement rights.
The recognition of plan assets is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available from refunds from the plans or
reductions in future contributions to the plans.108 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020

Assets are invested in a variety of different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return as follows:
• Equity and debt securities which mainly have quoted market prices (Level 1 fair value hierarchy).
• Property which is primarily in private and commercial property funds which mainly have other observable inputs
(Level 2 fair value hierarchy).
• Cash and money market instruments which are mainly invested with financial institutions with a credit rating no lower than A.
• Other investments which mainly consist of alternatives, mortgages, commodities and insurance contracts. These are used for
risk management purposes and mainly have other observable inputs (Level 2 fair value hierarchy) and unobservable inputs
(Level 3 fair value hierarchy).
Included within the fair value of plan assets are the Group’s shares and non-voting securities with a fair value of CHF 156 million
(2019: CHF 177 million) and debt instruments issued by the Group with a fair value of CHF 5 million (2019: CHF 5 million).Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 109
Defined benefit obligation
The defined benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method. This reflects service rendered by employees
to the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the
present value of benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth and mortality rates. The present value of the defined benefit
obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds
or government bonds in countries where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. The corporate or government bonds
are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and have maturity terms approximating to the terms of the
related pension obligation.
The Group’s final salary-based defined benefit pension plans in the US, Germany and the United Kingdom have been closed
to new participants. Active employees that had been members of these pension plans at the time these were closed to new
participants continue to accrue benefits in the final salary-based defined benefit pension plans. New employees in the US and
UK now join the Group’s defined contribution plans, while new employees in Germany join the contribution-based plan with a
minimum guarantee. As a result, the proportion of the defined benefit obligation which relates to these closed plans is expected
to decrease in the future. The defined benefit pension plans in Switzerland, where the final benefit is contribution based with a
minimum guarantee, remain open to new employees.

Actuarial assumptions
The actuarial assumptions used in these financial statements are based on the requirements set out in IAS 19 ‘Employee
Benefits’. They are unbiased and mutually compatible estimates of variables that determine the ultimate cost of providing
post-employment benefits. They are set on an annual basis by local management, based on advice from actuaries, and
are subject to approval by corporate management and the Group’s actuaries. Actuarial assumptions consist of demographic
assumptions on matters such as mortality and employee turnover, and financial assumptions on matters such as interest
rates, salary and benefit levels, inflation rates and costs of medical benefits. The actuarial assumptions vary based upon local
economic and social conditions. The actuarial assumptions used in the various statutory valuations may differ from these based
on local legal and regulatory requirements.
Demographic assumptions. The most significant demographic assumptions relate to mortality rates. The Group’s actuaries
use mortality tables which take into account historic patterns and expected changes, such as further increases in longevity.
Rates of employee turnover, disability and early retirement are based on historical behaviour. The average life expectancy
assumed now for an individual at the age of 65 is as follows:
Defined benefit plans: average life expectancy at the age of 65 for major schemes in years

Germany Heubeck tables 2018 G projected with CMI model 20.3 19.4 23.8 22.7
The mortality assumptions used for the pension plans in Switzerland were based on BVG 2015 applying the Continuous
Mortality Investigation (‘CMI’) model. A long-term rate of 1.25% (2019: 1.25%) was used for longevity improvements.
The Group used as mortality assumptions for the pension plans in Germany Heubeck tables 2018 G applying the CMI model with
a long-term rate of 1.25% for longevity improvements (2019: 1.25%).
Financial assumptions. These are based on market expectations for the period over which the obligations are to be settled.
The assumptions used in the actuarial valuations are shown below.

Ultimate medical cost trend rate (in 2038) 4.35% 4.00% – 4.50% 4.49% 4.00% – 4.50%
Discount rates are determined with reference to interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds in
countries where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. Expected rates of salary increases are based on expected
inflation rates with an adjustment to reflect the Group’s latest expectation of long-term real salary increases taking into
account expected inflation rates, amongst other factors. Expected rates of pension increases are generally linked to the
expected inflation rate or the funding status of the plan. Expected inflation rates are derived by looking at the level of inflation
implied by the financial markets in conjunction with the economists’ price inflation forecasts, historic price inflation as well as
other economic variables and circumstances. Medical cost trend rates take into account the benefits set out in the plan terms
and expected future changes in medical costs. Since the Group’s major post-employment medical plans are for US employees,
these rates are driven by developments in the US.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 111
Sensitivity analysis. The measurement of the net defined benefit obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount
rate, inflation rate, expected mortality and medical cost trend rate assumptions. The following table summarises the impact of a
change in those assumptions on the present value of the defined benefit obligation.

Each sensitivity analysis considers the change in one assumption at a time leaving the other assumptions unchanged.
This approach shows the isolated effect of changing one individual assumption but does not take into account that some
assumptions are related. The method used to carry out the sensitivity analysis is the same as in the prior year.
Cash flows
The Group incurred cash flows from its defined benefit plans as shown in the table below.

Employer contributions, net of reimbursements – funded plans (410) (493)
Benefits paid – unfunded plans (191) (183)
Total cash inflow (outflow) (601) (676)
Based on the most recent actuarial valuations, the Group expects that employer contributions for funded plans in 2021 will be
approximately CHF 415 million, which includes an estimated CHF 10 million of additional voluntary contributions related to the
Chugai benefit plans. Benefits paid for unfunded plans in 2021 are estimated to be approximately CHF 191 million, which mostly
relate to the German defined benefit plans.112 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020
27. Equity compensation plans
The Group operates several equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Chugai. IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’
requires that the fair value of all equity compensation plan awards granted to employees be estimated at grant date and
recorded as an expense over the vesting period.

Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights. The Group issues Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) to certain
directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The S-SARs give employees the right to receive
non-voting equity securities reflecting the value of any appreciation in the market price of the non-voting equity securities
between the grant date and the exercise date. Under the Roche S-SAR Plan 180 million S-SARs will be available for issuance over
a ten-year period, starting from 2013. The rights, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a ten-year duration and
vest on a phased basis over four years. Rights granted before 2019 have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over
three years.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 113

Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan. The Group issues Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) awards to certain directors, management and
employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The RSUs, which are non-tradable, represent the right to receive non-voting
equity securities. RSUs vest on a phased basis over four years, subject to performance conditions, if any. RSUs granted before
2019 vest after a three-year period. There are currently no performance conditions on outstanding RSUs at 31 December 2020.
Under the Roche RSU Plan 20 million non-voting equity securities will be available for issuance over a ten-year period, starting
from 2013. The Roche RSU Plan also includes a value adjustment which will be an amount equivalent to the sum of shareholder
distributions made by the Group during the vesting period attributable to the number of non-voting equity securities for which
an individual award has been granted.

Roche Performance Share Plan. Before 2019 the Group offered future share and non-voting equity security awards (or, at the
discretion of the Board of Directors, their cash equivalent) to certain directors and key senior managers. These are non-tradable
equity-settled awards. Under this programme there remains one annual three-year cycle. The Roche Performance Share Plan
(PSP) includes a value adjustment which is an amount equivalent to the sum of shareholder distributions made by the Group during
the vesting period attributable to the number of shares or non-voting equity securities for which an individual award has
been granted. The amount of shares or non-voting equity securities allocated depends upon the individual’s salary level, the
achievement of performance targets linked to the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (shares and non-voting equity securities
combined) relative to the Group’s peers during the three-year period from the date of the grant, and the discretion of the Board
of Directors. Each award granted will result in between zero and two shares or non-voting equity securities (before value
adjustment), depending upon the achievement of the performance targets. In 2019 and 2020 no new PSP awards were granted.

Roche Connect. This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the US and certain other countries,
to make regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting equity securities. It is administered by independent third
parties. The Group contributes to the programme, which allows the employees to purchase non-voting equity securities at
a discount (usually 20%). The administrator purchases the necessary non-voting equity securities directly from the market.
At 31 December 2020 the administrator held 3.3 million non-voting equity securities (2019: 3.1 million). In 2020 the cost of
the plan was CHF 27 million (2019: CHF 26 million).
Roche Option Plan. This programme is used in countries where S-SARs are not used. Awards under this plan give employees
the right to purchase non-voting equity securities at an exercise price specified at the grant date. The options, which are
non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a ten-year duration and vest on a phased basis over four years. Options granted
before 2019 have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years.

28. Leases
Implementation of IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
Effective 1 January 2019 the Group implemented IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. IFRS 16 replaced existing leases guidance, including IAS 17
‘Leases’, and sets out the principles for recognition and measurement of leases.
The main effect on the Group as a lessee was that IFRS 16 introduced a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model. It
requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for its leases. The lease liability reflects the present value of the remaining
lease payments, and the right-of-use asset corresponds to the lease liability, adjusted for payments made before the lease
commencement date, lease incentives and other items related to the lease agreement. As a result, right-of-use assets totalling
CHF 1,162 million and lease liabilities totalling CHF 1,194 million were recorded on the balance sheet effective 1 January 2019.
All transition impacts on the balance sheet are shown in the table below.

The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities recognised on transition was 1.49%.
The operating lease commitments and finance lease liabilities reported in the 2018 Annual Financial Statements, applying the
previous leasing standard IAS 17, can be reconciled to the lease liabilities recognised on transition to IFRS 16 as shown in the
table below.

Transition approach and use of practical expedients. The Group applied the cumulative catch-up method for the transition.
The cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 was recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings
at 1 January 2019, with no restatement of comparative information. Right-of-use assets were generally measured at an amount
equal to the lease liability, adjusted for payments made before the lease commencement date, lease incentives and other items
related to the lease agreement that were recognised on the balance sheet immediately before the date of initial application.
Some right-of-use assets were measured at their carrying amount as if IFRS 16 had been applied since the lease commencement
date, but discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate at 1 January 2019. Some practical expedients permitted by
the standard were used, notably:
• To not reassess upon transition whether an existing contract contains a lease. The definition of a lease under IFRS 16 was
applied only to contracts entered into or changed on or after 1 January 2019.
• The recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.
• For motor vehicles to not separate non-lease components and instead to account for the lease and non-lease components as
a single lease component.
• To apply IAS 37 for onerous leases instead of performing an impairment review.
The Group as a lessee
The Group enters into leasing transaction as a lessee mainly for reasons of convenience and flexibility. The Group has good
cash generation ability and it enjoys strong long-term investment grade credit ratings. Therefore it typically does not enter
into leasing arrangements for financing considerations. The main areas of leases that the Group has entered into are for:
• Property – offices and apartments. These are a small number of leases, but represent most of the value.
• Cars – mostly for sales representatives.
• Office equipment – photocopiers and similar.118 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020

The maturity analysis of lease liabilities is given in Note 31 in the ‘Liquidity risk’ section.
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are accounted for using the recognition exemption permitted by IFRS 16.
Expenses for short-term leases are recognised on a straight-line basis. These mainly include short-term property leases
for employee apartments. The amount reported in 2020 was CHF 43 million (2019: CHF 55 million). Expenses for leases of
low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis. These mainly include certain office equipment. The amount reported
in 2020 was CHF 17 million (2019: CHF 22 million).
Expenses for variable lease payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities was CHF 34 million in 2020
(2019: CHF 45 million). Income from subleasing right-of-use assets was CHF 8 million in 2020 (2019: CHF 10 million). In 2020
and 2019 the Group did not enter into any sale and leaseback transactions.
The major cash flows in respect of leases where the Group is the lessee are shown in the table below.

2020 2019
Included in cash flows from operating activities (94) (122)
Included in cash flows from financing activities (387) (390)
Total lease payments (481) (512)
Cash flows from operating activities include cash flows from short-term lease, leases of low-value assets and variable lease
payments. Cash flows from financing activities include the payment of interest and the principal portion of lease liabilities as
well as prepayments made before the lease commencement date.
Leases committed and not yet commenced. In July 2019 Foundation Medicine, Inc. (‘FMI’) entered into a binding lease
agreement with a third party for the lease of laboratory and office space in a building in Boston, US, which is to be constructed
by the landlord at the location currently known as ‘Boston Seaport’. According to the agreement FMI is committed to lease
the building for 15 years. The commencement date of the lease is currently expected to be in the second half of 2022. The
initial right-of-use asset and lease liability related to this agreement are estimated to be approximately USD 670 million based
on current assumptions.120 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020
The Group as a lessor
In the Diagnostics Division the Group enters into certain contracts which include placement of diagnostics instruments, supply
of reagents and other consumables, and servicing arrangements. Depending upon the term of the agreement, the instrument
placement may result in either a finance lease or an operating lease. The Group performs a thorough customer assessment
before new leasing agreements are signed. Usually the Group also retains rights to terminate or modify contracts if certain
conditions are not met.
Finance leases. Certain assets, mainly diagnostics instruments, are leased to third parties through finance lease arrangements.
Such assets are reported as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Income from finance leases is
recognised as revenue at amounts that represent the fair value of the instrument, which approximates the present value of the
minimum lease payments under the arrangement. Finance income for finance lease arrangements longer than twelve months
is deferred and subsequently recognised based on a pattern that approximates the use of the effective interest method and
recorded in royalty and other operating income.
The following amounts were recorded as income in respect of finance leases.

Operating leases. Certain assets, mainly diagnostics instruments, are leased to third parties through operating lease
arrangements. Income from operating leases is recognised as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term or, when
lease revenue is entirely based on variable lease payments and subject to subsequent reagent sales, as the performance
obligations for reagents are satisfied.
Lease income in 2020 was CHF 788 million (2019: CHF 782 million) and was included in sales. Of this CHF 596 million
(2019: CHF 583 million) relates to variable lease payments not depending upon an index or rate.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 121

Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities arise from the Group’s primary activities in the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics Divisions.
These are calculated using the indirect method by adjusting the Group’s operating profit for any operating income and
expenses that are not cash flows (for example depreciation, amortisation and impairment) in order to derive the cash generated
from operations. This and other operating cash flows are shown in the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flows also
include income taxes paid on all activities.

31. Risk management
Group risk management
Risk management is a fundamental element of the Group’s business practice on all levels and encompasses different types of
risks. At Group level, risk management is an integral part of the long-term forecasting and controlling processes. Material risks
are monitored and regularly discussed with the Corporate Executive Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors.
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising from its underlying operations and corporate finance activities. The Group’s
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices as well
as the creditworthiness and the solvency of the Group’s counterparties.
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies reviewed by the boards of directors of Roche and Chugai
as appropriate to their areas of statutory responsibility. These policies cover credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. The policies
provide guidance on risk limits, types of authorised financial instruments and monitoring procedures. As a general principle,
the policies prohibit the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Policy implementation and
day-to-day risk management are carried out by the relevant treasury functions and regular reporting on these risks is performed
by the relevant accounting and controlling functions within Roche and Chugai.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations, causing financial
losses for the Group. The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses of liquid funds deposited with or
invested in such counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering
netting agreements and without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements, is equal to the carrying
value of the Group’s financial assets.
The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the counterparty is unlikely to pay its obligations to the Group in full.
In assessing whether a counterparty is in default, the Group considers both qualitative and quantitative indicators (e.g. overdue
status) that are based on data developed internally and for certain financial assets are also obtained from external sources.
A major part of the Group’s receivables which are past due more than 90 days relate to public customers. Risk of default of
public customers is considered low. The Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more
lagging default criterion is more appropriate for this particular customer segment.
Accounts receivable. At 31 December 2020 the Group has trade receivables of CHF 11.0 billion (2019: CHF 11.3 billion). These
are subject to a policy of active credit risk management which focuses on the assessment of country risk, credit availability,
ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures. The objective of trade receivables management is to maximise
the collection of unpaid amounts.
The Group uses an allowance matrix to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for all trade receivables. The expected
credit loss (‘ECL’) rate is based on the Group’s historical experience and the Group’s expectation of economic conditions over
the period until receivables are expected to be paid.126 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020

At 31 December 2020 the Group’s combined trade receivables balance with three US national wholesale distributors,
McKesson Corp., AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Cardinal Health, Inc., was equivalent to CHF 2.7 billion representing 25% of the
Group’s consolidated trade receivables (2019: CHF 2.9 billion representing 26%). There is no other significant concentration
of counterparty credit risk due to the Group’s large number of customers and their wide geographical spread. Risk limits and
exposures are continuously monitored by country and by the nature of counterparties. The Group obtains credit insurance
and similar enhancements when appropriate to protect the collection of trade receivables. At 31 December 2020 no collateral
was considered to measure expected credit losses for trade receivables (2019: none).
Since 2010 there have been financial difficulties in Southern European countries, notably Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal.
The Group is a leading supplier to the healthcare sectors in these countries and has trade receivables of CHF 0.7 billion
(2019: CHF 0.8 billion) with the public and private customers in these countries. The Group uses different measures to improve
collections in these countries, including intense communication with customers, factoring, negotiations of payment plans,
charging of interest for late payments, and legal actions.
The nature and geographic location of counterparties to accounts receivable that are not overdue or impaired are shown in the
table below. These include the balances with US national wholesalers and Southern Europe public customers described above.

Cash and marketable securities (excluding equity securities). At 31 December 2020 the Group has cash and marketable
securities (excluding equity securities) of CHF 12.3 billion (2019: CHF 11.8 billion). These are subject to a policy of restricting
exposures to high-quality counterparties and setting defined limits for individual counterparties. These limits and counterparty
credit ratings are reviewed regularly.
Cash and cash equivalents are held with banks and financial institutions, which are predominantly rated as investment grade
(96% in both 2020 and 2019), based on Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s ratings. Cash and short-term time deposits are subject
to rules which limit the Group’s exposure to individual financial institutions.
Impairment on cash and cash equivalents is measured on a 12-month expected credit losses (‘ECL’) basis with a reference
to external credit ratings of the counterparties, and reflect the short maturities of the exposures. The Group considers that its
cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on these external credit ratings.
Investments in marketable securities (excluding equity securities) are entered into on the basis of guidelines with regard to
liquidity, quality and maximum amount. As a general rule, the Group invests only in high-quality securities with adequate liquidity
and with counterparties that have a credit rating of at least Baa3 from Moody’s and BBB- from Standard & Poor’s.
The credit risk of the counterparties with external ratings below investment grade or with no rating is closely monitored and
reviewed on an individual basis.

Loss allowance a) 1 0 1 1 0 1
a) The loss allowance related to fair value through OCI does not affect the carrying amount of marketable securities (excluding equity securities) but is booked against
corresponding OCI reserve instead.
Debt securities at amortised cost and those at fair value through OCI are investment grade and therefore considered to be low
risk, and thus the impairment allowance is determined at 12-month expected credit losses (‘ECL’) with a reference to external
credit ratings of the counterparties. There were no debt securities for which the Group observed a significant increase in the
credit risk which would require the application of the lifetime expected credit losses impairment model. In addition, there were
no material movements in the loss allowance in 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Master netting agreements. The Group enters into derivative transactions and collateral agreements under International Swaps
and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements with the respective counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty
risk. Under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding
in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. The ISDA agreements do
not meet the criteria for offsetting in the balance sheet as the Group does not have a currently enforceable right to offset
recognised amounts, because the right to offset is only enforceable on the occurrence of future events, such as a default or
other credit events.
Contract terms. At 31 December 2020 there are no significant financial assets whose terms have been renegotiated (2019: none).
Impairment losses on financial assets excluding equity investments/securities. During 2020 there were no impairment losses
(2019: none).128 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time. The Group’s
approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements at any point
in time. Roche and Chugai enjoy strong credit quality and are rated by at least one major credit rating agency. The ratings will
permit efficient access to the international capital markets in the event of major financing requirements. At 31 December 2020
the Group has an unused committed credit line with various financial institutions totalling CHF 7.0 billion (2019: CHF 7.6 billion),
of which CHF 6.6 billion (2019: CHF 7.3 billion) serve as a back-stop line for the commercial paper program. On 3 July 2019 the
previously existing committed credit lines were refinanced by one new committed credit line with an initial maturity of five years.

Take-or-pay commitments. The Group has entered into contract manufacturing agreements with various companies
to further develop manufacturing capacity and flexibility, mainly in the Pharmaceuticals Division. There are future
minimum take-or-pay commitments within some of these agreements with a total potential commitment from the Group of
CHF 1.5 billion at 31 December 2020 (2019: CHF 1.4 billion).
Market risk
Market risk arises from changing market prices, mainly foreign exchange rates and interest rates, of the Group’s financial assets
or financial liabilities which affect the Group’s financial result and equity.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 129
Value-at-Risk. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to measure the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. VaR indicates
the value range within which a given financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in
market prices. VaR is calculated using a historical simulation approach and for each scenario, all financial instruments are
fully valued and the total change in value and earnings is determined. VaR calculations are based on a 95% confidence level
and a holding period of 20 trading days over the past ten years. This holding period reflects the time required to change the
corresponding risk exposure, should this be deemed appropriate.
Actual future gains and losses associated with our treasury activities may differ materially from the VaR analyses due to the
inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes to interest rates, foreign exchange rates and
equity investment prices, particularly in periods of high market volatilities. Furthermore, VaR does not include the effect of
changes in credit spreads.

VaR – Other price component 59 34
Diversification (55) (72)
VaR – Total market risk 132 164
The interest rate component decreased due to the reduction in the underlying interest rates across major currencies.
The foreign exchange component decreased due to a favourable exposure mix. The other price component increased mainly
due to higher prices of equity investments and equity securities.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group uses the Swiss franc as its reporting currency and as a result is exposed to movements in foreign currencies, mainly
the US dollar, Japanese yen and euro. The Group’s foreign exchange risk management strategy is to preserve the economic
value of its current and future assets and to minimise the volatility of the Group’s financial result. The primary focus of the Group’s
foreign exchange risk management activities is on hedging transaction exposures arising through foreign currency flows or
monetary positions held in foreign currencies. The Group uses forward contracts, foreign exchange options and cross-currency
swaps to hedge transaction exposures. Application of these instruments intends to continuously immunise against unfavourable
developments of foreign exchange rates.
Interest rate risk
The Group mainly raises debt on a fixed rate basis for bonds and notes. The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates,
mainly for its US dollar, Swiss franc and euro floating rate financial instruments and short-term debt. The Group’s interest rate
risk management strategy is to optimise the net interest result. The Group may use forward contracts, options and interest
rate swaps to hedge its interest rate exposures. Depending on the interest rate environment of major currencies, the Group will
use these instruments to generate an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposures.
Other price risk
Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities. The Group manages the price risk through
placing limits on individual and total equity investments. These limits are defined both as a percentage of total liquid funds and
as an absolute number for individual equity investments.
Capital management
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total capitalisation, being the sum of debt plus equity, including
non-controlling interests. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide benefits for patients and
returns to investors.
• To provide an adequate return to investors based on the level of risk undertaken.
• To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver future benefits for
patients and returns to investors.
• To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.130 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020
The capitalisation is reported to senior management as part of the Group’s regular internal management reporting and is shown
in the table below.

Level 1 financial assets consist of treasury bills, bonds and quoted shares. Level 2 financial assets consist primarily of
commercial paper, certificates of deposit and derivative financial instruments.
The Group determines Level 2 fair values using the following valuation techniques:
• Marketable securities and derivative financial instruments are based on valuation models that use observable market data for
interest rates, yield curves, foreign exchange rates and implied volatilities for similar instruments at the measurement date.
• Equity investments at fair value through OCI and at fair value through profit or loss are based on a valuation model that uses
the most recently published observable market data.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as at the end of the reporting period during which
the transfer has occurred. There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and vice versa during the year
(2019: none).Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 133

Contingent consideration arrangements
The Group is party to certain contingent consideration arrangements, including those from business combinations. The fair
values of contingent consideration from business combinations are determined considering the expected payments, discounted
to present value using a risk-adjusted average discount rate of 2.1% (2019: 3.0%). The expected payments are determined by
considering the possible scenarios of forecast sales and other performance criteria, the amount to be paid under each scenario,
and the probability of each scenario. The significant unobservable inputs are the forecast sales, other performance criteria
and the risk-adjusted discount rate. The estimated fair value would increase if the forecast sales or other performance criteria
rates were higher or the risk-adjusted discount rate was lower. At 31 December 2020 the total potential payments under
contingent consideration arrangements arising from business combinations could be up to CHF 0.4 billion (2019: CHF 0.5 billion)

Hedge accounting
As described above the Group’s risk management strategy is to hedge the transaction exposures arising through foreign
currency flows or monetary positions held in foreign currencies as well as to generate an appropriate mix of fixed and floating
rate exposures. The level of hedging depends on market conditions and business requirements of the Group. The Group
designates a specific interest rate risk management objective to ensure that a predetermined level of its interest rate risk
exposure is at a floating rate.
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness
assessments at each reporting date to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and the hedging
instrument. The Group performs a qualitative assessment of the hedge effectiveness using a critical terms match method.
As the critical terms of the hedged items and the hedging instruments match, the Group concludes that risks being hedged
for the hedged items and the hedging instruments are sufficiently aligned, that there is no inherent mismatch in the hedging
relationship and that a 100% hedge ratio applies both for the actual quantities hedged and for the hedge accounting.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 135

The ineffective portion of the hedge accounting is recognised in the income statement and included in other financial income
(expense). It is measured using the hypothetical derivative method for cash flow hedges and the cumulative dollar offset
method for fair value hedges. At 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2019, respectively, none of the above potential sources
of ineffectiveness, individually or collectively, resulted in material amounts of actual ineffectiveness being reported for any
hedge accounting relationships.
The table below shows fair values and nominal amounts of derivative financial instruments, including a range of the maturity of
the nominal amount of the hedging instruments, which are designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge and a fair
value hedge. At 31 December 2020 and 2019, respectively, the Group has the following cash flow hedges and fair value hedges
which are designated in a qualifying hedge relationship:

The fair values of derivative financial instruments used for hedge accounting are included in other current assets (see Note 16)
or other current liabilities (see Note 19). The Group’s approach to managing market risk, including interest rate risk and foreign
currency risk, is discussed in the ‘Market risk’ section in this Note.
Cash flow hedges. The Group has entered into cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk on
some of the bonds and notes issued by the Group which are denominated in euro. At 31 December 2020 such instruments
are recorded as a net fair value liability of CHF 37 million (2019: net fair value liability of CHF 119 million). There was no
ineffective portion.
Chugai has entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge a part of its foreign translation exposure to Swiss franc and
US dollar. At 31 December 2020 such instruments are recorded as fair value assets of CHF 14 million and as fair value liabilities
of CHF 67 million (2019: fair value assets of CHF 40 million and fair value liabilities of CHF 56 million). There was no ineffective
portion.
None of the hedging instruments currently held for applying hedge accounting is affected by the InterBank Offered Rates
(‘IBOR’) reform.

Fair value hedges. The Group has entered into some interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in the fair value
of some of its fixed-term debt instruments in respect of a benchmark interest rate. At 31 December 2020 such instruments are
recorded as fair value assets of CHF 9 million (2019: fair value assets of CHF 8 million). During 2020 fair value adjustments of
CHF 1 million were recorded on these interest rate swaps (2019: CHF 23 million). All interest rate swaps currently held for
applying hedge accounting are referenced to a benchmark rate other than the London InterBank Offered Rate (‘LIBOR’) except
for the hedging instrument hedging a portion of EUR 100 million of the 6.5% notes due 4 March 2021. As the fair value hedge
had been highly effective since inception, the result of the interest rate swaps was largely offset by changes in the fair value of
the hedged debt instruments. The Group’s approach to managing market risk, including interest rate risk, is discussed in the
‘Market risk’ section in this Note.

On 13 December 2019 the Group resolved to exercise its option to call for early redemption of the 2.0% fixed rate notes with
a principal amount of USD 0.6 billion at par three months before the scheduled due date of 13 March 2020 (see Note 21).
This resulted in a termination of the fair value hedge accounting applied to the interest rate swaps with a nominal value of
USD 600 million and a fair value of less than CHF 1 million at the date of the termination.

34. Significant accounting policies
Consolidation policy
Subsidiaries are all companies over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed
to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its
power over the entity. Companies acquired during the year are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to
the Group, and subsidiaries to be divested are included up to the date on which control passes from the Group. Intercompany
balances, transactions and resulting unrealised income are eliminated in full. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries
are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has already been obtained and if they do not result in a loss
of control. Associates are companies over which the Group exercises, or has the power to exercise, significant influence, but
which it does not control, and they are accounted for using the equity method.
Segment reporting
For the purpose of segment reporting the Group’s Corporate Executive Committee (CEC) is considered to be the Group’s Chief
Operating Decision Maker. The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the organisation units for which
information is reported to the CEC on a regular basis. The information provided is used as the basis of the segment revenue
and profit disclosures reported in Note 2, with the geographic analysis based on the location of customers. Selected segment
balance sheet information is also routinely provided to the CEC.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis. Operating assets and liabilities consist of
property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade receivables/payables, inventories and other assets and
liabilities, such as provisions, which can be reasonably attributed to the reported operating segments. Non-operating assets
and liabilities mainly include current and deferred income tax balances, post-employment benefit assets/liabilities and financial
assets/liabilities such as cash, marketable securities, investments and debt.
Foreign currency translation
The Annual Financial Statements are presented in Swiss francs. Most Group companies use their local currency as their
functional currency. Certain Group companies use other currencies (such as US dollar, Swiss franc or euro) as their functional
currency where this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Local transactions in other
currencies are initially reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses from the settlement
of such transactions and gains and losses on translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are
included in income, except when they are qualifying cash flow hedges or arise on monetary items that, in substance, form part of
the Group’s net investment in a foreign entity. In such cases the gains and losses are deferred into other comprehensive income.
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using functional currencies other than Swiss francs are translated
into Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange. The income statement and statement of cash flows are translated at the
average rates of exchange for the year. Translation differences due to the changes in exchange rates between the beginning
and the end of the year and the difference between net income translated at the average and year-end exchange rates are
taken directly to other comprehensive income.
Revenue
Sales. Revenue from the sale of goods supplied (product sales) and services rendered are recoded as ‘Sales’.
Sales are recognised when a promise in a customer contract (performance obligation) has been satisfied by transferring control
over the promised goods and services to the customer. Control over a promised good or service refers to the ability to direct
the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, those goods or services. Control is usually transferred
upon shipment, delivery to, upon receipt of goods by the customer, or as services are rendered, in accordance with the delivery
and acceptance terms agreed with the customers. For goods subject to installation, such as instruments sold in the Diagnostics
Division, sales are generally recognised upon completion of the installation at the customer’s site and customer acceptance.
The amount of sales to be recognised (transaction price) is based on the consideration the Group expects to receive in exchange
for its goods and services, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties such as value added taxes or other taxes
directly linked to sales. If a contract contains more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each
performance obligation based on their relative stand-alone selling prices.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 147
Instruments in the Diagnostics Division may be sold together with other goods such as reagents and other consumables as well
as services under a single contract or under several contracts that are combined for revenue recognition purposes. Sales
are recognised upon satisfaction of each of the performance obligations in the contract. Instruments are either sold in cash and
instalment sales transactions or otherwise made available to customers under finance lease and operating lease transactions.
• Finance leases: Arrangements in which the Group transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the
customer are treated as finance lease arrangements. Income from finance leases is recognised as revenue at amounts that
represent the fair value of the instrument, which approximates the present value of the minimum lease payments under the
arrangement. As interest rates embedded in finance lease arrangements are approximately market rates, income from finance
leases is comparable to revenue for outright sales. Finance income for finance lease arrangements longer than twelve
months is deferred and subsequently recognised based on a pattern that approximates the use of the effective interest rate
method and recorded in royalty and other operating income.
• Operating leases: Income from operating leases is recognised as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term or, when
lease revenue is entirely variable and subject to subsequent reagent sales, as the performance obligation to deliver reagents
is satisfied.
Sales, net of discounts, are based on estimates regarding the related obligations, including their stand-alone selling prices or
fair values. It requires judgement to determine when different obligations are satisfied, including whether enforceable purchase
commitments for further obligations exist and when they arise.
For contracts with distributors, no sales are recognised when goods are physically transferred to the distributor under a consignment
arrangement, or if the distributor acts as an agent. In such cases, sales are recognised when control over the goods transfers to
the end-customer, and distributor’s commissions are presented within marketing and distribution. Commissions and similar payments
to distributors acting as principals are deducted from sales unless such payments are in exchange for a distinct service.
The consideration received by the Group in exchange for its goods and services may be fixed or variable. Variable consideration
is only recognised when it is considered highly probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur once the underlying
uncertainty related to variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The most common elements of variable consideration in
the Pharmaceuticals Division are listed below:
• Government and regulatory mandatory price reductions. These consist of mandatory price reductions. The major elements
are the 340B Drug Discount Program, Medicaid and other plans in the US.
• Contractual price reductions. These include rebates and chargebacks that are the result of contractual agreements that are
primarily volume based and performance based.
• Cash discounts. These include credits offered to wholesalers for remitting payment on their purchases within contractually
defined incentive periods.
• Customer returns reserves. These are allowances established for expected product returns.
Revenues from product sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts and estimates
of product returns, all of which are established at the time of sale. All product sales allowances are based on estimates of the
amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration historical experience, current
contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends such as competitive pricing and new product
introductions, estimated inventory levels, and the shelf life of products. If actual future results vary, these estimates need
to be adjusted, with an effect on sales and earnings in the period of the adjustment. Sales reductions that are expected to be
withheld by the customer upon settlement, such as contractual price reductions and cash discounts, are recorded in the
balance sheet as a deduction from trade receivables. Sales reductions that are separately payable to customers, governmental
health authorities or healthcare regulatory authorities are recorded in the balance sheet as accrued liabilities. Provisions for
sales returns are recorded in the balance sheet as other provisions.
The Group recognises a deferred income (contract liability) if consideration has been received (or has become receivable)
before the Group transfers the promised goods or services to the customer. Deferred income mainly relates to remaining
performance obligations for goods free of charge under certain patient access or similar programmes, reagents and other
consumables and services.
Remaining performance obligations in (partially) unsatisfied long-term contracts are either included in deferred income or are
related to amounts the Group expects to receive for goods and services that have not yet been transferred to customers
under existing, non-cancellable or otherwise enforceable contracts. These are mainly associated with contracts with minimum
purchase commitments related to reagents and consumables for previously sold instruments as well as monitoring and
maintenance services. For contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, the Group has elected the practical
expedient to not disclose the transaction price for remaining performance obligations at the end of each reporting period
and at which point in time the Group expects to recognise these sales.148 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020
Royalty and other operating income. Royalty and other operating income includes royalty income, income from out-licensing
agreements and income from disposal of products and other items.
Royalty income earned through a licence is recognised as the underlying sales are recorded by the licensee.
Income from out-licensing agreements typically arises from the receipt of upfront, milestone and other similar payments
from third parties for granting a licence to product- or technology-related intellectual property (IP). Out-licensing agreements may
be entered into with no further obligation or may include commitments to conduct research, late-stage development, regulatory
approval, co-marketing or manufacturing. Licences granted are usually rights to use IP and are generally unique. Therefore
the basis of allocating revenue to performance obligations makes use of the residual approach. Upfront payments and other
licensing fees are usually recognised upon granting the licence unless some of the income shall be deferred for other
performance obligations using the residual approach. Such deferred income is released and recognised as revenue when other
performance obligations are satisfied. Milestone payments are typically received upon reaching a specific scientific milestone
(development milestone) or upon achieving a certain annual sales milestone (commercial milestone). Development milestone
income is recognised at the point in time when it is highly probable that the respective milestone event criteria is achieved, and
the risk of revenue reversal is considered remote. Commercial milestone income is accrued and recognised as revenue when it
is highly probable that the annual sales milestone is reached during the period.
Payments received for the disposal of product and similar rights are recognised as revenue upon transfer of control over
such rights. To the extent that some of these payments relate to other performance obligations, a portion is deferred using
the residual approach and recognised as revenue when or as activities such as manufacturing or other services are rendered.
Income from profit-sharing arrangements with collaboration partners is recognised as underlying sales and cost of sales are
recorded by the collaboration partners. Also included is income from other services rendered which are usually not part of
the Group’s primary business activities, to the extent that such revenue is not recorded under ‘Sales’, and is recognised when
control transfers and performance obligations are satisfied.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and related production overheads of goods sold and services
rendered. Royalties, alliance and collaboration expenses, including all collaboration profit-sharing arrangements are also
reported as part of cost of sales. Start-up costs between validation and the achievement of normal production capacity are
expensed as incurred.
Research and development
Internal research and development activities are expensed as incurred for the following:
• Internal research costs incurred for the purpose of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.
• Internal development costs incurred for the application of research findings or other knowledge to plan and develop new
products for commercial production. The development projects undertaken by the Group are subject to technical, regulatory
and other uncertainties, such that, in the opinion of management, the criteria for capitalisation as intangible assets are not
met prior to obtaining marketing approval by the regulatory authorities in major markets.
• Post-marketing studies after regulatory approval, such as phase IV costs in the pharmaceuticals business, generally involve
safety surveillance and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives marketing approval to be sold. They may be
required by regulatory authorities or may be undertaken for safety or commercial reasons. The costs of such post-marketing
studies are not capitalised as intangible assets as, in the opinion of management, they do not generate separately identifiable
incremental future economic benefits that can be reliably measured.
Acquired in-process research and development resources obtained through in-licensing arrangements, business combinations
or separate asset purchases are capitalised as intangible assets. The acquired asset must be controlled by the Group, be
separately identifiable and expected to generate future economic benefits, even if uncertainty exists as to whether the
research and development will ultimately result in a marketable product. Consequently, upfront and milestone payments to third
parties for pharmaceutical products or compounds before regulatory marketing approval are recognised as intangible assets.
Assets acquired through such arrangements are measured on the basis set out in the ‘Intangible assets’ policy. Subsequent
internal research and development costs incurred post-acquisition are treated in the same way as other internal research and
development costs. If research and development are embedded in contracts for strategic alliances, the Group carefully assesses
whether upfront or milestone payments constitute funding of research and development work or acquisition of an asset.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 149
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits include wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, profit
sharing and bonuses, and non-monetary benefits for current employees. The costs are recognised within the operating results
when the employee has rendered the associated service. The Group recognises a liability for profit sharing and bonuses where
contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Long-term employee benefits include long-service or sabbatical leave, long-service benefits and long-term disability benefits.
The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment. Any changes in the carrying value of other
long-term employee benefit liabilities are recognised within the operating results.
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever
an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. Termination costs are recognised at the earlier of
when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of the benefits or when the Group recognises any related restructuring costs.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
For defined contribution plans the Group contributions are recognised within the operating results when the employee has
rendered the associated service. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a
reduction in future payments is available.
For defined benefit plans the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less
the fair value of the plan assets. All changes in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as they occur as follows:
Recognised in the income statement:
• Current service cost is charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results.
• Past service cost, including curtailment gains or losses, is recognised immediately in general and administration within the
operating results.
• Settlement gains or losses are recognised in general and administration within the operating results.
• Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is recognised in financing costs.
Recognised in other comprehensive income:
• Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments (the difference between previous assumptions and what has
actually occurred) and changes in actuarial assumptions.
• The return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability.
• Any change in the limit on the recognition of plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit
liability.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is comprised of interest income on plan assets, interest cost on the defined benefit
obligation and interest on the effect of the limit on the recognition of pension assets. The net interest is calculated using the
same discount rate that is used in calculating the defined benefit obligation, applied to the net defined liability at the start of
the period, taking into account any changes from contribution or benefit payments.
Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to
use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan.
Equity compensation plans
The fair value of all equity compensation awards granted to employees is estimated at the grant date and recorded as an
expense over the vesting period. The expense is charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating
results. For equity-settled plans, an increase in equity is recorded for this expense and any subsequent cash flows from
exercises of vested awards are recorded as changes in equity.150 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction, and include all costs directly attributable
to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by
management. These include items such as costs of site preparation, installation and assembly costs, and professional fees.
The net costs of testing whether the asset is functioning properly, including validation costs, are also included in the initially
recorded cost of construction. Interest and other borrowing costs incurred with respect to qualifying assets are capitalised and
included in the carrying value of the assets. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis, except for
land, which is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives of major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
Land improvements 40 years
Buildings 10–50 years
Machinery and equipment 4–15 years
Diagnostic instruments 3–5 years
Office equipment 3–6 years
Motor vehicles 5–8 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate
components. The estimated useful lives of the assets are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation charges
are accelerated. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Leases
Where the Group is the lessee – policy applicable from 1 January 2019. At inception of a contract the Group assesses
whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the
use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset
and a corresponding lease liability for each contract that is, or contains, a lease at the lease commencement date, except
for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. Payments for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are
recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective lease. The lease liability is initially measured
at the present value of the future lease payments that are not paid at the lease commencement date. The lease payments
are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate
in the respective markets. Lease payments include fixed payments, variable payments that depend on an index or rate known
at the lease commencement date and payments from exercising extension or purchase options if the Group is reasonably
certain to exercise. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised costs using the effective interest method. It is
remeasured, with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset, when there is a change in future lease payments
following a contract renegotiation, a change of an index or rate or a reassessment of options. The right-of-use asset is initially
measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any payments made at or before the
lease commencement date and which includes any initial direct costs incurred and expected costs of obligations to dismantle,
remove or refurbish the underlying asset, less any incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line
basis from the lease commencement date over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset.
Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication for impairment.
Where the Group is the lessee – policy applicable before 1 January 2019. The Group classified leases that substantially
transferred all of the risks and rewards of ownership as finance leases. Finance leases were capitalised as property, plant
and equipment at the start of the lease at fair value, or the present value of the minimum lease payments, if lower. The rental
obligation, net of finance charges, was reported within debt. Finance lease assets were depreciated over the shorter of the
lease term and its useful life. The interest element of the lease payment was charged against income over the lease term based
on the effective interest rate method. All other leases were classified as operating leases. Operating leases existed when
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership were not transferred to the Group. Payments made under operating
leases were charged against income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 151
Where the Group is the lessor. Certain assets, mainly Diagnostics instruments, are leased to third-party customers through
both finance and operating lease arrangements. Such transactions may be entered into in separate contracts or in combined
contracts including reagents and other consumables and services. The treatment of leasing transactions is mainly determined
by whether the lease is considered to be an operating or finance lease. In making this assessment, management looks at the
substance of the lease, as well as the legal form, and makes a judgement about whether substantially all of the risks and
rewards of ownership are transferred. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease. If not, then it is an operating lease.
Arrangements which do not take the legal form of a lease but that nevertheless convey the right to use an asset are also
covered by such assessments.
• Finance leases: Finance lease assets are reported as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease.
Income from finance leases is recognised as revenue at amounts that represent the stand-alone selling price of the
instrument, which approximates the present value of the minimum lease payments under the arrangement. Minimum lease
payments exclude any variable lease payments or contingent rent. Finance income for finance lease arrangements longer
than twelve months is deferred and subsequently recognised based on a pattern that approximates the use of the effective
interest method and recorded in royalty and other operating income.
• Operating leases: Income from operating leases is recognised as revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term at
amounts that represent the stand-alone selling price of the instrument, which approximates the present value of the minimum
lease payments under the arrangement. Minimum lease payments exclude any variable lease payments or contingent rent.
When lease revenue is entirely based on variable lease payments and subject to subsequent reagent sales, it is recognised as
the performance obligations for reagents are satisfied.
Sales, net of discounts, are based on estimates regarding the related obligations, including their stand-alone selling prices.
It requires judgement to determine when different obligations are satisfied, including whether enforceable purchase
commitments for further obligations exist and when they arise.
Mergers and acquisitions
Business combinations. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. At the
date of the acquisition the Group initially recognises the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed
and any non-controlling interest in the acquired business. The consideration transferred is measured at fair value at the
date of acquisition. Where the Group does not acquire 100% ownership of the acquired business, non-controlling interests are
recorded either at fair value or as the proportion of the fair value of the acquired net assets attributable to the non-controlling
interest. Directly attributable acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred within general and administration expenses.
Asset acquisitions. Asset acquisitions are acquisitions of legal entities that do not qualify as business combinations. At the
date of the acquisition the Group initially recognises the individual identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The cost to the Group at the date of the acquisition is allocated to the individual identifiable assets and liabilities on the basis
of their relative fair values at the date of the acquisition. Subsequent consideration for performance-related development
milestones is recognised as intangible assets when the specific milestones have been achieved. Such transactions do not give
rise to goodwill. Material directly attributable acquisition-related costs are included in the cost of the acquired assets.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises in a business combination and is the excess of the consideration transferred to acquire the business over
the underlying fair value of the net identified assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least
annually and upon the occurrence of an indication of impairment.
Intangible assets
Purchased patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Assets that have been acquired
through a business combination are initially recorded at fair value. Commercial software development costs are capitalised
when certain recognition criteria such as technical feasibility and commercial viability are met. Once available for use, intangible
assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at each
reporting date. The estimated useful life is the lower of the legal duration and the economic useful life. The estimated useful lives
of intangible assets are regularly reviewed. Estimated useful lives of major classes of amortisable intangible assets are as follows:
Product intangibles in use up to 20 years
Marketing intangibles in use up to 15 years
Technology intangibles in use up to 20 years152 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and intangible assets
An impairment assessment is carried out when there is evidence that an asset may be impaired. In addition, intangible assets
that are not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. When the recoverable amount of an asset, being the higher
of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value is reduced
to its recoverable amount. This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. Value in use is calculated
using estimated cash flows, generally over a five-year period, with extrapolating projections for subsequent years. These are
discounted using an appropriate long-term interest rate. When an impairment loss arises, the useful life of the asset is reviewed
and, if necessary, the future depreciation/amortisation charge is accelerated. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently
decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the
previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement as an impairment reversal.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is assessed for impairment at each reporting date and is additionally tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is
allocated to cash-generating units and when the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, being the higher of its
fair value less costs of disposal or its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value of the goodwill is
reduced to its recoverable amount. This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. When an acquired
business that is included within a cash-generating unit permanently ceases to operate then it is treated as a disposal of that
business. For separately identifiable goodwill that was generated on the initial acquisition of that business and where all of the
factors that made up that goodwill are entirely unrelated to the continuing operations of the cash-generating unit, then the
goodwill is deemed to have been disposed of and is fully impaired. The impairment testing methodology is further described
in Note 9.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods, work in process and
intermediates includes raw materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs and overheads based upon the normal
capacity of production facilities. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Net realisable value is the estimated
selling price less cost to completion and selling expenses.
Receivables, including accounts receivable
Receivables are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts, trade discounts, cash
discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances. A receivable represents a right to consideration that is unconditional and
excludes contract assets. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for expected credit losses over the term of
the receivables. These estimates are based on specific indicators, such as the ageing of customer balances, specific credit
circumstances and the Group’s historical loss rates for each category of customers, and adjusted for forward-looking
macroeconomic data. Expenses for doubtful trade receivables are recognised within marketing and distribution expenses.
Trade discounts, cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with
the recognition of the related sales, using estimates based on existing contractual obligations, historical trends and the Group’s
experience.
Receivables are written off (either partly or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Where receivables
have been written off, the Group continues to engage in enforcement activities to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where
recoveries are made, these are recognised in profit or loss.
For trade and lease receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach prescribed by IFRS 9, which requires/permits the use
of the lifetime expected loss provision from initial recognition of the receivables. The Group measures an allowance for doubtful
accounts equal to the credit losses expected over the lifetime of the trade and lease receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and time, call and current balances with banks and similar institutions.
Such balances are only reported as cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to
insignificant risk of changes in their fair value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 153
Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to an outflow of
resources that can be reliably estimated. In particular, restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has a detailed
formal plan that has either commenced implementation or has been announced. Provisions are recorded for the estimated
ultimate liability that is expected to arise and are discounted when the time value of money is material. A contingent liability is
disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation
cannot be measured with reasonable reliability. Contingent assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of
economic benefits is probable.
Fair values
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices or by the use of established
valuation techniques such as option pricing models and the discounted cash flow method if quoted prices in an active market
are not available.
Financial instruments
The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following measurement categories which are disclosed in Note 31: amortised
cost; fair value through OCI; fair value through OCI – equity investments; or fair value through profit or loss (including hedging
instruments).
The classification depends on the Group’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the
cash flows. The Group reclassifies debt securities and financial assets at amortised cost when and only when its business model
for managing those assets changes.
At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value
through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs
of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.
Amortised cost. Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments
of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment. A gain or loss on a debt security that is
subsequently measured at amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset
is derecognised or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other financial income using the effective
interest rate method. Assets at amortised cost are mainly comprised of accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents and
time accounts over three months.
Fair value through other comprehensive income (fair value through OCI). These are financial assets that are held for
collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments
of principal and interest. Those are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value are
recorded in other comprehensive income, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign
exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain
or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss. Interest income from these financial assets
is included in other financial income using the effective interest rate method. Fair value through other comprehensive income
assets are mainly comprised of money market instruments and debt securities.
Equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (fair value through OCI). These are equity investments
in private biotechnology companies, which are kept as part of the Group’s strategic alliance efforts. These assets are
subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognised as other financial income in profit or loss unless the dividend
clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognised in OCI and
included in the fair value reserve. When such an asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI
is reclassified within equity from the fair value reserve to retained earnings and never to profit or loss.154 Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements Finance Report 2020
Fair value through profit or loss. These are financial assets whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis. A gain or loss
on a financial asset that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship
is recognised in profit or loss and presented within other financial income (expense) in the period in which it arises. Fair value
through profit or loss assets are mainly comprised of equity investments/securities. Contingent consideration liabilities are
initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in general and administration within
the operating results of the income statement.
Fair value through profit or loss – hedging instruments. These are derivative financial instruments that are used to manage
the exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. These instruments are initially recorded
and subsequently carried at fair value. Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments,
all changes in fair value are recorded as other financial income (expense).
Other financial liabilities. These are non-derivative financial liabilities. Other financial liabilities are initially recorded at
fair value, less transaction costs, and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Other
financial liabilities are mainly comprised of debt and trade payables.
Debt. Debt instruments are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Subsequently
they are reported at amortised cost. Any discount between the net proceeds received and the principal value due on
redemption is amortised over the duration of the debt instrument and is recognised as part of financing costs using the
effective interest rate method.
Derecognition. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual cash flows from the asset expire or when the Group
transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows from the financial assets in a transaction in which substantially all the
risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when the contractual
obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses (‘ECL’) for financial assets measured at amortised cost and
debt securities measured at fair value through OCI.
For trade and lease receivables the Group measures the allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.
For debt securities carried at fair value through OCI and debt securities and other financial assets at amortised cost, which
are determined to have low credit risk based on external credit ratings of the counterparties, the Group measures loss
allowances at an amount equal to 12-month ECL. The Group considers debt securities to have low credit risk when their credit
risk rating is equivalent to the globally understood definition of ‘investment grade’. The Group considers this to be at least Baa3
from Moody’s and BBB- from Standard & Poor’s. When the credit risk of debt securities carried at fair value through OCI and
debt securities and other financial assets at amortised cost has increased significantly since their initial recognition, the Group
measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. The Group assumes that the credit risk of such instruments have
increased significantly if they are more than 30 days past due.
Financial assets are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally
the case when the Group determines that the customer does not have assets or sources of income that could generate
sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off are still
subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group’s policy for recovery of amounts due.
Hedge accounting
The Group uses derivatives to manage its exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. The
instruments used may include interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, forwards contracts and options. The Group generally
limits the use of hedge accounting to certain significant transactions. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship
must meet several strict conditions on eligibility of hedging and hedged instruments, formal designation and documentation, as
well as hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. While many of these transactions can be considered as hedges in
economic terms, if the required conditions are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case
the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship, which means
that any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in other financial income (expense).Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group 155
Cash flow hedge. This is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction and could affect profit or loss. The hedging
instrument is recorded at fair value. The effective portion of the hedge is included in other comprehensive income and any
ineffective portion is reported in other financial income (expense). If the hedging relationship is the hedge of the foreign
currency risk of a firm commitment or highly probable forecasted transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial
item, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive
income are included in the initial carrying value of the non-financial item at the date of recognition. For all other cash flow
hedges, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive
income are included in other financial income (expense) when the forecasted transaction affects net income.
Fair value hedge. This is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or an unrecognised
firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk
and could affect profit or loss. The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item is recorded at its previous
carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair value that are attributable to the hedged risk. Changes in the fair values are
reported in other financial income (expense).
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding taxes payable on the
distribution of retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based on income, such as property and capital taxes, are
included within general and administration expenses.
Liabilities for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally
relating to subsidiaries, are only recognised where it is probable that such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future.
Where the amount of tax liabilities is uncertain, accruals are recorded within income tax liabilities for management’s best
estimate of the ultimate liability that is expected to arise based on the specific circumstances and the Group’s historical
experience.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their carrying values. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the same taxation authority
and when there is a legally enforceable right to offset them. Deferred taxes are determined based on the currently enacted tax
rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction where the Group operates.
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The original purchase cost,
consideration received for subsequent resale of these equity instruments and other movements are reported as changes in
equity. These instruments are held for the Group’s potential conversion obligations that may arise from the Group’s equity
compensation plans.
Changes in accounting policies
In 2020 the Group has implemented various minor amendments to existing standards and interpretations, which have no
material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position. The amendments to IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ on the
definition of a business, which are mandatorily applicable in 2020, were early adopted by the Group in 2018.
Future new and revised standards
The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of the various new and revised standards and interpretations that
will be mandatory from 1 January 2021 which the Group has not yet applied. Based on an analysis to date, the Group does
not anticipate that these will have a material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position. The Group is also
assessing other new and revised standards which are not mandatory until after 2021.156 Roche Group | Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Finance Report 2020
Report of Roche Management on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
control over financial reporting. The internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance over the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2020
based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment,
management has concluded that the system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 31 December 2020.
The Statutory Auditor KPMG AG has audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended

Statutory Auditor’s Report
To the General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise
the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2020 and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement
of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements (pages 48–155) give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial
position of the Group as at 31 December 2020, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows
for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and Swiss Auditing Standards.
Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit
of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the
provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as the International Ethics Standards Board
for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards)
(IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

We performed sensitivity analysis over key assumptions
to identify those that were more likely to lead to a material
misstatement so we could focus our work and assess
management’s allowance for risk. Throughout our procedures
we challenged management’s external valuers.
We obtained an understanding of Spark’s integrated
gene therapy platform that comprises multiple elements
including in-licensed and in-house developed technologies,
expertise and know-how of Spark personnel, and processes
in the areas of vector design, vector manufacturing and
investigational new drug enabling studies and regulatory
processes for gene therapy. We challenged the level of
goodwill recognised and assessed the appropriateness
of management’s decision to allocate the goodwill to the
Roche Pharmaceuticals cash-generating unit based on
expected synergies and how those would be used within
the Roche business. We have also assessed whether the
Group’s disclosures in relation to the acquisition meet the
requirements of the relevant accounting standards.

Other Information in the Annual Report
The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information in the annual report. The other information comprises all
information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial
statements of the company, the remuneration report and our auditor’s reports thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information in the annual report and we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information in the
annual report and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we
have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibility of the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in
accordance with IFRS and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law,
ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and
maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal control.
— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made.
— Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to
the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going
concern.
— Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures,
and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation.Finance Report 2020 Statutory Auditor’s Report | Roche Group 163
— Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within
the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision
and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.
We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report
because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such
communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and the Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control
system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions
of the Board of Directors.
We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

Alternative Performance Measures
The financial information included in the Financial Review includes certain Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) which are
not accounting measures as defined by IFRS, in particular the core results, net working capital, net operating assets, free cash
flow and constant exchange rates. These APMs should not be used instead of, or considered as alternatives to, the Group’s
consolidated financial results based on IFRS. These APMs may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other
companies. All APMs presented in the Financial Review relate to the performance of the current year and comparative periods.
Core results
Core results allow for an assessment of both the Group’s actual results as defined by IFRS and the underlying performance of
the business. The core results concept, which is used in the internal management of the business, is based on the IFRS results,
with the following adjustments:
• Global restructuring plans (see Note 7) are excluded.
• Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (see Note 10), excluding commercial software intangible assets, and
impairment of goodwill (see Note 9) are excluded.
• Acquisition accounting and other impacts from the accounting for merger and acquisition transactions and alliance
arrangements (see Financial Review) are excluded.
• Discontinued operations (currently none) are excluded.
• Legal and environmental cases (see Financial Review) are excluded.
• Global issues outside the healthcare sector beyond the Group’s control are excluded.
• Material treasury items such as major debt restructurings (currently none) are excluded.
• Pension plan settlements (see Note 26) are excluded.
• The tax benefit recorded under IFRS in respect of Equity Compensation Plans (ECPs), which varies according to the price of the
underlying equity, is replaced by a normalised tax benefit, being the IFRS 2 expense multiplied by the applicable tax rate (see Note 5).
The core results concept was further described on 22 October 2010 at an Investor Update teleconference, which is available
for download at: http://www.roche.com/investors/ir_agenda/csr_151010.htm

Free cash flow
Free cash flow is used to assess the Group’s ability to generate the cash required to conduct and maintain its operations.
It also indicates the Group’s ability to generate cash to finance dividend payments, repay debt and to undertake merger and
acquisition activities. The free cash flow concept is used in the internal management of the business.
Operating free cash flow is calculated based on the IFRS operating profit and adjusted for certain non-cash items, movements
in net working capital and capital expenditures (investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as well
as the principal portion of lease liabilities paid for leased assets). Operating free cash flow is different from cash flows from
operating activities as defined by IAS 7 in that it includes capital expenditures (which are within the responsibility of divisional
management) and excludes income taxes paid (which are not within the responsibility of divisional management). Cash outflows
from defined benefit plans are allocated to the operating free cash flow based on the current service cost with the residual
allocated to treasury activities.
Free cash flow is calculated as the operating free cash flow adjusted for treasury activities and taxes paid. Free cash flow is
different from total cash flows as defined by IAS 7 in that it excludes dividend payments, cash inflows/outflows from financing
activities such as issuance/repayment of debt, purchase/sale of marketable securities and cash inflows/outflows from mergers,
acquisitions and divestments.172 Roche Group | Multi-Year Overview and Supplementary Information Finance Report 2020

EBITDA
The Group does not use Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) in either its internal management
reporting or its external communications. In the opinion of the Group’s management, operating free cash flow gives a more
useful and consistent measurement of ‘cash earnings’ than EBITDA, which includes many non-cash items such as provisions,
allowances for trade receivables and inventories, and certain non-cash entries arising from acquisition accounting and pension
accounting. Operating free cash flow also includes the cash used for investments in property, plant and equipment, leased
assets and intangible assets, whereas EBITDA excludes all costs and cash outflows for these items.
For the convenience of those readers who do use EBITDA, this is provided in the table below. As the starting point this uses the
core results, which already exclude the amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.

Net operating assets
Net operating assets allow for an assessment of the Group’s operating performance of the business independently from
financing and tax activities. Net operating assets are calculated as property, plant and equipment, leased assets
(‘right-of-use assets’), goodwill, intangible assets, net working capital and long-term net operating assets minus provisions.
The calculation of the net operating assets disclosed in Note 2 of the Annual Financial Statements is shown in the tables below.

Net debt
Net debt is used to monitor the Group’s overall short- and long-term liquidity. Net debt is calculated as the sum of total debt
(long-term and short-term) less marketable securities, cash and cash equivalents.
Net debt calculations, including details of movements during the current year, are shown in the table on page 40 in the
Financial Review.
Net working capital
Net working capital is used to assess the Group’s efficiency in utilising assets and short-term liquidity. Net trade working capital
is calculated as trade receivables and inventories minus trade payables. Net working capital is calculated as net trade working
capital adjusted for other receivables and other payables.
Net working capital and net trade working capital calculations are shown in the tables on page 27 (Pharmaceuticals Division),
page 33 (Diagnostics Division) and page 35 (Corporate) in the Financial Review.
Constant exchange rates
Certain percentage changes in the Financial Review have been calculated using constant exchange rates (CER) which allow for
an assessment of the Group’s financial performance with the effects of exchange rate fluctuations eliminated. The percentage
changes at constant exchange rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the current reported period
and the prior period numbers at constant currency exchange rates, equalling the average exchange rates for the prior year.
For example, a CER change between a 2020 line item and its 2019 equivalent is calculated using the average exchange rate
for the year ended 31 December 2019 for both the 2020 line item and the 2019 line item and subsequently calculating the
change in percent with respect to the two recalculated numbers.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are excluded from the calculation of CER growth rates in the earnings per share disclosures.
In countries where there is a significant devaluation in the local currency in the current year, the simulations use the average
exchange rate of the current year instead of the prior year to avoid that CER growth rates are artificially inflated.Finance Report 2020 Roche Securities | Roche Group 177

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel (the ‘Company’) have been prepared in accordance with the provisions
of Swiss Law on Accounting and Financial Reporting (32nd title of the Swiss Code of Obligations, ‘CO’). Where not prescribed by
law, the significant accounting principles applied are described below.
The Company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with a recognised accounting standard
(International Financial Reporting Standards). In accordance with the CO, the Company decided to forgo presenting additional
information on audit fees in the notes as well as a cash flow statement.
Valuation methods and translation of foreign currencies
Marketable securities are reported at the lower of cost or market value. All other financial assets, including investments,
are reported at cost less appropriate write-downs. Own equity instruments are recognised at cost and deducted from equity
at the time of purchase. If the own equity instruments are sold, the gain or loss is recognised through the income statement.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange,
except investments which are translated at historical rates. Transactions during the year which are denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at the exchange rates effective at the relevant transaction dates. Resulting exchange gains and
losses are recognised in the income statement with the exception of unrealised gains which are deferred.
Investments
The direct and indirect investments of the Company are listed in Note 33 to the Roche Group Annual Financial Statements.
This listing excludes Chugai’s subsidiaries as well as companies that are not material, notably companies that are inactive,
dormant or in liquidation. Ownership interests equal voting rights.
Taxes
Direct taxes include corporate income and capital taxes.Finance Report 2020 Notes to the Financial Statements | Roche Holding Ltd, Basel 183
2. Shareholders’ equity
Share capital
As in the previous year, share capital amounts to CHF 160 million. The share capital consists of 160,000,000 bearer shares with
a nominal value of CHF 1.00 each. Included in equity are 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine). They are
not part of the share capital and confer no voting rights. However, each non-voting equity security confers the same rights as
any of the shares to participate in the available earnings and in any remaining proceeds from liquidation following repayment
of the nominal value of the share capital and, if any, participation certificates.
Own equity instruments
At 31 December 2020 the Company did not hold any Roche shares or non-voting equity securities (2019: none). During 2020
and 2019 the Company neither purchased nor sold Roche shares or non-voting equity securities.
Company subsidiaries that meet the definitions and requirements of Article 659b CO do not hold equity instruments. Within the
Roche Group Annual Financial Statements some entities (mainly foundations) are included in the consolidation which do not
qualify as subsidiaries under Article 659b CO.

owned 72,018,000 shares, which represented 45.01% of the issued shares. On 5 December 2019 the shareholder group

Holding Ltd. The shareholder pooling agreement has existed since 1948. The duration of the pool was extended for an indefinite
period in 2009. The figures above do not include any shares without pooled voting rights that are held outside this group by
individual members of the group. Ms Maja Oeri, formerly a member of the pool, holds 8,091,900 shares representing 5.057% of
the voting rights independently of the pool.
At 31 December 2020, based on information supplied to the Group, 53,332,863 shares (2019: 53,332,863 shares) are owned by
Novartis Holding AG, Basel (participation below 331⁄3%).

Statutory Auditor’s Report
To the General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2020,
the income statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant
accounting policies.
In our opinion the financial statements (pages 179–187) for the year ended 31 December 2020 comply with Swiss law and the
company’s articles of incorporation.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those provisions
and Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our
report. We are independent of the entity in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss
audit profession and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Report on Key Audit Matters based on the circular 1/2015 of the Federal Audit Oversight Authority
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial
statements of the current period. We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report.
Responsibility of the Board of Directors for the Financial Statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Swiss
law and the company’s articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary
to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the entity’s ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing
Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions
of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.Finance Report 2020 Statutory Auditor’s Report | Roche Holding Ltd, Basel 189
As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and
maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.
— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control.
— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made.
— Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern.
We communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during
our audit.
We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that were
of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We
describe these matters in our auditor’s report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and the Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control
system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of
Directors.
We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the company’s articles of
incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

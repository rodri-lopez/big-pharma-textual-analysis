Roche Business Report 2011 | Letters to ShareholdersDear Shareholders
The deepening debt crises in Europe and the United States, turbulent currency markets and slower
global economic growth all had a profound impact on the business landscape in 2011. Increasing
pressure on government budgets also weighed heavily on healthcare markets. With resources
stretched, many countries are focusing on short-term savings targets and budget controls. A number
of governments, particularly in Europe, have sought to ease their deficits by imposing substantial
price cuts on pharmaceuticals — including innovative, patent-protected medicines — along with other
measures aimed at controlling or reducing healthcare expenditure.
Amid these challenges Roche posted very strong results for the year. Group sales advanced 2%
at constant exchange rates (excluding Tamiflu) to 42.2 billion Swiss francs. Earnings performance
improved significantly faster, with net income rising 7% to 9.5 billion Swiss francs.
I am also very pleased that the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes once again named us the Super-
sector Leader in healthcare, ranking Roche as the world’s most sustainable healthcare company
for the third consecutive year. We are convinced that sustainable corporate policies and practices
create long-term value and promote innovation. They therefore support our primary mission as a
company, which is to prolong people’s lives or improve quality of life through excellence in science.
For a research-based company like ours, recent developments in healthcare policy and policy-
makers’ short-term focus on costs are a major cause for concern. Of course I understand that
Roche as a leading pharmaceutical and diagnostics company — and indeed, our industry as a
whole — must play its part in efforts to overcome the current financial and debt crises. We are pre-
pared to do that. Through constructive dialogue we aim to contribute to finding a fair and sus-
tainable balance between health policy and industrial policy — a balance that encourages and
rewards the type of innovation from which society as a whole will benefit.
In my nearly four decades of working in the healthcare industry, I have rarely been as optimistic as
I am now about the medium- to long-term outlook for research-based, innovation-driven companies.
The fundamental trends point in the right direction: a growing, ageing global population; increas-
ingly affluent emerging markets; rapid scientific and technological advances that are paving the way
for more targeted, cost-effective treatments; and an undiminished need for medical progress,
since many diseases are still not effectively treated.
We must not forget the increasing economic significance of innovation and the fact that nations,
regions and communities around the globe compete with each other for investment and jobs.
We see countries increasingly taking targeted action to promote research and innovation within
their borders. I am very impressed by the progress Shanghai, Beijing, Singapore and other cities
in emerging markets have made as they strive to become global leaders in the life sciences, particu-
larly in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics. Moreover, their positive attitude and openness towards
new scientific discoveries and technologies are definite assets.
5
Letters to Shareholders | Roche Business Report 2011These countries recognise that the research-based healthcare industry’s high productivity can
translate into significant economic growth, generating skilled jobs, further investment and exports.
High expenditures on research and development lead ultimately to strong value creation. Much
of Roche’s R & D activity continues to be located at our headquarters in Switzerland precisely
because of the country’s competitive advantage. Switzerland will remain one of the best places
in the world for investments in science if we can maintain and strengthen these innovation-pro-
moting advantages.
Why am I particularly optimistic about our company’s future? For over a decade now Roche has
maintained its strategic focus on innovative diagnostics and therapeutics. As the world’s biggest
biotech company, with 14 biopharmaceuticals on the market, we are ideally equipped to transform
our growing knowledge of disease biology into novel treatments and tests. In 2011 we spent
8 billion Swiss francs on research and development — a sum that puts us among the top R & D
spenders, regardless of the industry. Unlike some of our competitors, we intend to continue invest-
ing heavily in research and development, particularly in those areas where we have competitive
advantages: oncology, diabetes, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and neuroscience. At
the same time, we will maintain our strong focus on the optimal use of resources and continued
productivity improvements.
Roche remains the world’s leading supplier of cancer medicines and the number one in vitro diag-
nostics company. With its combined strengths in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics and proven
expertise in molecular biology, our company is uniquely positioned to make Personalised Healthcare
a reality. The achievements of the past year — the US launch of Zelboraf in record time, the Euro-
pean Medicines Agency’s positive opinion on this novel treatment for skin cancer and the progress
of other projects in our development pipeline — are all testimony to this.
Cost-effective, targeted medicines and diagnostics have a key role to play in overcoming the health-
care sector’s current difficulties. As pricing pressures increase, payers will shift resources to
products and services offering the greatest incremental benefit to patients. As a company focused
on developing medicines and tests that create real value for patients and physicians, we are well
equipped to compete successfully in an increasingly challenging healthcare market. The strengths
that serve us well today will be even more important tomorrow.
In view of the company’s strong performance and positive outlook — the difficult economic and
financial environment notwithstanding — the Board of Directors is proposing a dividend increase of
3% to 6.80 per share and non-voting equity security for 2011 (up from 6.60 Swiss francs in 2010).
Subject to your approval at the Annual General Meeting on 6 March 2012, this will be Roche’s 25 th
consecutive annual dividend increase.
Finally, I want to inform you that André Hoffmann and Prof. Sir John Irving Bell, two highly experi-
enced and distinguished Roche Board members, have agreed to stand for election for a further
term at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. I will be standing for re-election as Chairman and
would be honoured by your continued confidence.
Franz B. Humer

Roche Business Report 2011 | Letters to ShareholdersDear Shareholders
Given the significantly harsher market conditions we faced, 2011 was no easy year for your company,
but it was nevertheless a successful one.
Let’s look at Roche’s financial performance first. We met all of our 2011 targets, despite the significant
impact of a strong Swiss franc on our reported results. Excluding sales of our influenza medicine
Tamiflu, which as anticipated were down sharply from the previous year, Group sales advanced 2%
at constant exchange rates, with pharmaceutical sales up 1%, in line with market growth. The
Diagnostics Division posted a 6% increase in sales, reinforcing its position as the leading supplier
of in vitro diagnostics.
Group profitability continued to improve ongoing productivity gains and cost savings. This is all
the more impressive given the price cuts that were imposed on our products in some major markets.
Core Earnings per Share — a key metric of underlying performance which excludes non-core items
such as global restructuring charges, amortisation and impairment of intangible assets — increased
11% at constant exchange rates. Core operating profit grew strongly and faster than sales, rising
6% on a currency-adjusted basis to 15.1 billion Swiss francs. Both divisions again increased their
core operating profit margins. Our solid earnings performance will enable us to continue investing
heavily in research into the causes of disease and advancing the growing number of late-stage
projects in our product pipeline.
The success rate of our clinical trial programmes has been extraordinary and makes me very opti-
mistic about Roche’s future. In 2011 no fewer than 17 of our 20 major clinical trials for new medi-
cines reported positive data — an excellent mark also compared to the industry as a whole. These
results help position us even more strongly for future growth.
Roche owes its success to its employees. Thanks to their tremendous dedication and hard work
we — once again — met our annual objectives in an ever more challenging market environment. On
behalf of the Executive Committee, I take this additional opportunity to thank all Roche employees
for their valuable contributions.
Importantly, 2011 was a landmark year for Roche Personalised Healthcare. Due to advances in
molecular diagnostics, our therapies can increasingly be targeted at particular patient populations.
Already, roughly half the new molecular entities in our late-stage portfolio are tailored to subsets
of patients who can be identified using specific diagnostic tests.

Letters to Shareholders | Roche Business Report 2011Zelboraf, our novel, personalised therapy for metastatic melanoma, the most aggressive form of
skin cancer, is a major milestone for patients and their doctors, and for Roche. The US Food and
Drug Administration approved Zelboraf and its companion diagnostic test in August 2011, followed
late in the year by a recommendation for approval from the European Medicines Agency. This is
the first time Roche has simultaneously launched a new medicine and a companion diagnostic.
Close collaboration between our Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics Divisions was crucial to bring-
ing Zelboraf to market in the record time of just five years. Metastatic melanoma is extremely
difficult to treat and every hour of every day a patient somewhere dies of the disease. Zelboraf
inhibits a mutated form of the BRAF protein which occurs in about half of all melanomas and can
be detected with the Roche test. This is the first targeted treatment shown to extend the survival
of patients with metastatic melanoma and significantly improve their quality of life. We expect that
approvals in many additional markets over the course of 2012 will make Zelboraf and its companion
diagnostic available to patients worldwide.
In 2011 we also filed for regulatory approval of our novel biologic pertuzumab for the treatment of
breast cancer. This is another instance of a new drug addressing a significant medical need. Breast
cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, with more than 1.4 million new cases diag-
nosed annually. Worldwide, breast cancer still claims the lives of over 450,000 women every year,
despite major advances in therapy.
Pertuzumab is effective in the roughly 20% of breast cancer patients whose tumours carry a genetic
mutation causing them to overproduce a protein known as the HER2 receptor. These HER2-posi-
tive tumours are highly aggressive, fast growing and associated with a high risk of recurrence.
Pertu zumab is designed specifically to prevent the HER2 receptor from pairing with other HER
receptors, a process that is believed to play an important role in the formation and growth of
several types of cancer. Adding pertuzumab to a treatment regimen of Roche’s medicine Herceptin
and chemotherapy was found to reduce the risk of disease progression or death by an impressive
38%. Indeed, the clinical trial data are so encouraging that this drug combination could become
the new standard first-line treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer.
We aspire to make good treatment options better. One of our goals is to see cancer — once a certain
death sentence — increasingly become a chronic condition. Unfortunately, many cancers eventu-
ally develop resistance to therapies. Cancer cells are ‘masters of evasion’ and often start growing
and multiplying again. Combination regimens that attack cancers on several fronts simultaneously
will thus gain in importance.
Zelboraf and pertuzumab are tangible examples in the field of cancer of how we deliver significant
benefits to patients through excellence in science. We intend to build on successes like these
in oncology, and in other therapeutic areas, by developing more effective, targeted strategies for
fighting serious diseases. In addition to new cancer therapies, we are working on personalised
medicines for hepatitis C, for asthma, and drugs to alleviate or cure various disorders of the central
nervous system, including Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia and depression. We currently have
more than 200 drug development projects in which we are also doing research that could lead to
a companion diagnostic.
8
Roche Business Report 2011 | Letters to ShareholdersMolecular biology is ushering in a new era in medicine. Our clear strategic advantages in this field
will figure more and more prominently in our R & D successes going forward. As our understanding
of the underlying biology of diseases grows, so will our ability to develop targeted medicines and
companion diagnostics. We are increasingly making personalised healthcare a reality. This holds
tremendous potential for patients and healthcare systems — and for Roche.
We will encounter significant challenges and opportunities in the years ahead. Roche will respond
boldly and decisively to both as we continue to serve the interests of patients, employees and you,
our shareholders. Thank you for your continued confidence in our company.

How Personalised Healthcare works
Today, findings from new basic research disciplines are enabling
scientists to refine their understanding of diseases at the molecular
level and identify subgroups of outwardly similar patients whose
disorders have different causes.

How Roche is making Personalised Healthcare a reality
Combining strengths in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics with proven
expertise in molecular biology, Roche is committed to the systematic
pursuit of Personalised Healthcare. This concept is becoming a reality
for more and more of our development projects.

Cancer is a case in point of important insights derived from molecular

Additionally, we have established incident management teams
throughout the Roche Group to ensure that we act quickly in
an emergency. These teams regularly rehearse different crisis
scenarios, alerts and escalation procedures.
In 2011 we strengthened our business continuity management,
including establishing a Business Continuity Management task
force to ensure that all our sites respond effectively to cata-
strophic events. The importance of these efforts was high-
lighted by the tsunami that struck Japan in March 2011 and the
widespread flooding in Thailand in fall 2011. The task force is
developing a Group-wide business continuity framework, as
well as guidelines for local implementation. This work will con-
tinue through 2012, with the goal of establishing strategies and
responses to mitigate business continuity risks.

Research and Development | Roche Business Report 2011Roche Personalised Healthcare
How Personalised Healthcare works
On average, only about five out of ten patients who receive a given therapy actually benefit from it, while some
may experience side effects.
Thanks to advances in new research disciplines, scientists now have a better understanding of disease at the
molecular level. As a result, they are able to distinguish patient subgroups in which different causes drive
what has traditionally been regarded as a single disease. In oncology, this has led to efforts to identify genetic
characteristics affecting patients’ responses to particular therapies.
Identifying clinically significant patient subgroups is a key element of our Personalised Healthcare
strategy, which marries new diagnostic techniques with advances in biotechnology in an effort to
develop more targeted, more efficient therapies.
This strategy is being systematically implemented at every stage of new product development
at Roche and is aimed at helping us
• better understand disease diversity
• identify differences between patients
• identify the best drug targets
• improve the quality and efficiency of our R & D efforts
• develop biomarkers and diagnostic tests

Green logistics
Roche is committed to incorporating sustainable business
practices in all areas of its supply chain to not only improve
processes but also as a means of ensuring patient safety and
product quality.
The Pharmaceuticals Division has established a green logistics
project to reduce its environmental footprint for the transpor-
tation of raw materials and finished products. The project
includes several pilots to study alternative modes of transpor-
tation. Notable among them was changing from air freight to
refrigerated road and sea ferry transport for cold-chain prod-
ucts shipped between Switzerland and Greece. This change
reduced carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions by roughly 85% and
2
packaging by a significant amount, as insulating material was
no longer required.
Similarly, the Diagnostics Division realised significant reduc-
tions in CO emissions by using alternative modes of transpor-
2
tation and innovations in packaging. For example, emissions
were reduced by 84% for shipments between the US and
France by switching from air freight to truck and sea transport.
In Italy, changing from road transport to rail cut the division’s
CO emissions by 67%. And CO emissions from freight ship-

using temperature-controlled trailers.
Our first year of tracking reductions in CO emissions, waste

production and energy usage from logistics revealed several
challenges in data availability and quality, including differences
in methodologies among Roche sites for measuring energy
usage. In 2012 we will work to further develop reliable methods
of collecting consistent data throughout our organisation.

marketing responsibly and ethically
The pharmaceutical industry is governed by strict regulations
and industry guidelines for the sale and marketing of products.
As one of the world’s largest healthcare companies, Roche
takes seriously its obligation to meet these high standards. We
have rigorous internal processes to ensure that our employees
adhere to the laws, regulations and industry codes of conduct
that support good marketing practices. These include uphold­
ing our social responsibility for ensuring that decisions about
healthcare products and services are made using transparent,
open, fair and consistent processes.
Our Code of Conduct sets out standards for interacting and
engaging with healthcare professionals. The goal is to enable
healthcare professionals to make decisions independently,
based on all relevant data available, for delivering the greatest
medical benefit to patients. We continuously train staff who
interact with healthcare professionals to increase awareness
and understanding of our Code of Conduct, as well as industry
and country­specific marketing codes, guidelines and best
practices. In addition, Roche uses a global marketing and
sales compliance questionnaire to help local managers assess

‘In the field of oncology it is particularly helpful to involve
diagnostics as early as possible in clinical development.
This increases the efficiency and speed of discovering and
developing patient selection markers that could have an
actual impact in the clinic, and make an important difference
to patients’ lives. In order to do this at a high frequency for
our drug candidates across multiple indications, a dedicated
in-house diagnostics effort is required, and Roche clearly
has one of the largest and strongest in the industry.’

‘Increasingly, treatment decisions are based on sophisticated

Our People | Roche Business Report 2011Roche Personalised Healthcare
Intervening at the molecular level
Thanks to ultramodern methods of sequencing the genome — including a series of innovative technologies
from Roche — today’s scientists have identified some 350 genes involved in the genesis of cancer. An
example is the BRAF gene that is found in a mutated form in about 50% of all cases of metastatic melanoma
(the most aggressive form of skin cancer) and approximately 8% of all solid tumours.
Receptors
Grb2
RAF
MEK KSR
ERK
Oncogenic
BRAF
ERK
Transcription
factor
A mutation of the BRAF gene results in an abnormal BRAF protein that is locked
in an active state. This may lead to uncontrolled cell growth and survival, potentially
driving the development and progression of a tumour.
Our new cancer medicine Zelboraf selectively blocks the action of the altered BRAF
protein. This may cause cancer cells to stop growing or even die, which in turn can
lead to tumour shrinkage, reduce the risk of disease progression and extend a patient’s
life.
Personalised Healthcare is the strategy of the future. Not only for cancer, but also
for fighting infectious diseases like hepatitis B and C, inflammatory diseases such as
asthma and diseases of the central nervous system.

cycle, including supporting those affected by organisational
changes such as our Operational Excellence programme. To
date around 4,100 positions have been reduced in Roche Phar-
maceuticals as a result of the programme. Of those reductions,
about 1,400 took place in 2010 and a further 2,700 during 2011,
including transfers to third parties. These changes have been
partially off-set by headcount increases in our Diagnostics
Division and in emerging markets, such as China, where we
continue to build capacities and capabilities given the increas-
ing importance of those markets to Roche.
By the end of March 2011, we had concluded consultations
with employee representative bodies about Operational Excel-
lence and ensured that social plans and support measures
were in place to meet the needs of all affected employees.
Those measures included severance pay, outplacement ser-
vices, counselling, access to career centres, retraining and
redeployment options.

Focused giving. We direct our efforts across four strategic areas, with an
emphasis on innovation, collaboration and sustainability, as exemplified by the
EDUCARE programme which trains healthcare professionals in oncology in
sub-Saharan Africa.
Measuring impacts. We assess our engagement through the outcomes of the
projects we support. To advance this, we strengthened our processes for collecting
outcome information from our affiliates during 2011.
Community redevelopment. A particular area of focus in 2011 was
redevelopment projects in communities which had been devastated by natural
disasters, such as the rebuilding of schools in Haiti and Pakistan.
Supporting education. In partnership with UNICEF Switzerland we laid the
foundation for a new teachers training college in Malawi, that will house and train
540 teachers in 2013.

Environmental Stewardship | Roche Business Report 2011Roche Personalised Healthcare
Personalised treatment strategies
Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) can cause acute or chronic liver damage and ultimately lead
to liver failure, cirrhosis or cancer of the liver. Worldwide, about 170 million people are infected with HCV.
Today we know that there are a number of subtypes of HCV that differ not only in their molecular structure
but also in their responsiveness to treatment. Roche has developed molecular tests that can identify
which HCV subtype a patient has. This information helps physicians predict how long a patient should
continue treatment (e.g. 24, 48 or 72 weeks) in order to achieve a lasting virological response.

Remuneration Report | Roche Business Report 20111.3 Security holdings. Directors André Hoffmann and
Andreas Oeri and members of the founders’ families who are
closely associated with them belong to a shareholder group
with pooled voting rights. At the end of 2011 this group held
72,018,000 shares (45.01% of issued shares). Detailed informa-
tion about this group can be found in the Finance Report, Note
32 to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
(‘Related parties’, page 130) and in the Note 4 to the Financial
Statements of Roche Holding Ltd (‘Significant shareholders’,
page 158). In addition, as of 31 December 2011 the members
of the Board of Directors and persons closely associated with
them and the members of the Executive Committee and per-
sons closely associated with them held shares and NES as
shown in the table on page 135.
1.4 Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs). At
31 December 2011 Franz B. Humer and William M. Burns
(being the only members of the Board of Directors holding
S-SARs due to their former positions) and the members of the
Corporate Executive Committee held Stock-settled Stock
Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) as shown in the table ‘S-SARs’
on page 136.
The S-SARs shown in the table on page 136 were introduced
by Roche on 1 January 2005 in place of stock options. S-SARs
entitle holders to benefit financially from any increase in the
value of Roche’s NES between the grant date and the exercise
date. The strike price for S-SARs under the terms of this multi-
year plan was the closing price for Roche NES at grant date. All
S-SARs vest within three years of the grant date: i.e. one-third
vest at the end of one year, one-third at the end of two years,
and one-third at the end of three years. Vested S-SARs must
be exercised (converted into NES) within seven years of the
grant date, and unexercised S-SARs lapse without compensa-
tion. The fair value of the S-SARs is calculated at the date of
issue using the Black-Scholes formula and as if the S-SARs
were tradable, with an 11% deduction for the average two-year
vesting period.
The strike prices, expiry dates and grant values for S-SARs are
shown in the table on page 136. The numbers of S-SARs as
calculated at the time of issue have been entered as values in
the table ‘Remuneration of members of the Corporate Execu-
tive Committee, C. Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights
(S-SARs)’ on page 130.

Our responsibility is to provide a conclusion on the subject
matter based on our assurance procedures in accordance
with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements
(ISAE) 3000.
For those subject matters with a limited assurance the evi-
dence-gathering procedures are more limited than with a rea-
sonable assurance (for example, an audit of financial state-
ments), and therefore less assurance is obtained than in an
overall reasonable assurance engagement.

Annual
Report
2011
626 x 297 210 11 210 195
Annual Report
was a landmark year for Roche Personalised Healthcare. This
annual report highlights the progress we made in advancing a strategic
priority shared by the entire Roche Group. We successfully launched
new tests and medicines tailored to the needs of specific patient popu-
lations and made good progress in developing others that also promise
to make treatment safer and more effective. At Roche we believe that
medically differentiated products benefit all healthcare stakeholders, from
patients and physicians to regulators and payers.

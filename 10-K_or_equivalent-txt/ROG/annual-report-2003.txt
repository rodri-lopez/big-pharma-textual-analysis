Results before exceptional itemsLetter from the Chairman
Dear Shareholders
The Roche Group made significant strategic,operational and financial progress
in 2003.Our Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics divisions recorded growth rates well
ahead of their respective markets,and this,together with further increases in
profitability and our strong research and development pipelines,confirms that our
strategy of focus and innovation is on track.Net income is now back to a healthy
level,and we have continued restructuring our finances and reducing Group debt.
At the same time,we have further enhanced corporate governance.The Board of
Directors will propose a dividend increase of 14% to 1.65 Swiss francs per share and
non-voting equity security to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.
If approved,this will be the Group’s seventeenth dividend increase in as many years.

2003 was a very successful year for the Pharmaceuticals Division, with sales
growing ahead of the world market and an even faster rise in operating profit.
Thanks to the strong performance of the division’s oncology portfolio, especially
MabThera/Rituxan, Roche extended its number-one position in this important
therapeutic area.We expect novel products like Avastin to help us achieve even
stronger leadership in oncology in the future.
Our new hepatitis C treatment Pegasys surpassed our expectations in its first full
year on the market in terms of sales and market penetration.Another milestone
was the launch of our novel HIV/AIDS drug Fuzeon.
Nearly 30 licensing agreements for new technologies and products were
concluded in 2003 to complement our strong internal research organisation.

Outlook
Based on its achievements in 2003,the
Pharmaceuticals Division has a solid
medium-term perspective,with sales
again expected to grow faster than the
world market in 2004.
We anticipate continued strong
growthfor our cancer products.The
addition ofAvastin to our oncology
portfolio will be a major milestone in
2004 and will set the stage for continu-
ing leadership in the oncology sector.
We anticipate an increase in sales of
Pegasys andFuzeon and expect Neo-
Recormon,Epogin and CellCept to
remain major sales drivers.Rocephin
and Roaccutane/Accutane are expected
to play a less important role in our
overall portfolio.
Thanks to our current and future
products,we are ideally positioned for
sustained growth in our core areas of
competency:oncology,virology and
anemia.We expect to maintain our
current strength in the specialty care
sector.
Pharmaceuticals 33Thanks to treatment with Pegasys, Margaret, who lives
in Miami, has completely cleared her hepatitis C infec-
tion. Viral load monitoring with reliable, highly sensitive
molecular diagnostic tests show that her blood is now
virus free.
For many patients with viral diseases, Roche’s efforts to align diagnosis,
treatment and response monitoring are vitally important. Our PCR-based
blood tests enable doctors to determine the stage of a patient’s disease and
thus help guide decisions on the dose and duration of therapy.Diagnostics Division in brief

Two major acquisitions – Disetronic (insulin pumps) and Igen (immuno-

above-average sales gains combined to make 2003 a successful year for Roche
Diagnostics, despite limited global market growth. The division not only
maintained its global leadership but in fact increased its pre-eminence over the
competition, growing its market share from 19% to 20% and again posting
a substantial – double-digit – increase in profitability.

Outlook
Roche Diagnostics’recent strategic
moves – Disetronic,Igen and
Affymetrix – mean that it is now in a
position to develop new products and
markets with high growth potential.
With the help ofDNA microarray and
other cutting-edge technologies we
aim to advance the paradigm shift to
individualised healthcare solutions
and play a leading role in developing
the market for health information.
Roche Diagnostics is on track to
achieve its objectives ofabove-market
growth in fiscal 2004 and an operat-
ingprofit margin before exceptional
items ofaround 23% in 2006.This is
equivalent to the previously announced
goal ofan adjusted marginof20%.

Corporate Governance 53Finance
During 2003 Roche Finance made significant progress in providing
a solid platform for value creation and the entrepreneurial develop-
ment of the Group and towards achieving conditions for a balanced
financial income by the end of 2004. Debt was reduced by 7.1 billion
Swiss francs, instruments covering convertible debt obligations
were re-financed,and short-term bank debt was replaced by attractive
long-term financing. Furthermore, we have reduced the risk expo-
sures of financial investments and foreign exchange transactions.
The core businesses Pharma and Diagnostics continue to achieve
improved operating results and strong cash generation.As a result,
Group net liquidity increased by 5.3 billion Swiss francs to 5.9 billion
Swiss francs, and the ratio of equity and minority interests to total
assets improved to 49% from 40%.

Operating
In 2003, the Roche Group’s continuing businesses Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics showed
steady progress. Local currency sales in the core businesses were up by 19%, with roughly 12%
due to organic growth and the remainder due to the acquisition of Chugai. The 25% growth in
local currency operating profit before exceptional items was driven by sales growth, particularly
in high margin products and business areas, and by reduced other operating expenses. Operating
costs increased due to the Chugai integration, launch expenses, higher research and develop-

Financial Review 55ment expenses and higher administration costs. When also taking into account the exceptional
items, local operating profit growth was even stronger at 37%, mainly as a result of the income of
225 million Swiss francs from Genentech legal settlements in the second half of 2003 compared
to the 2002 charge for the Genentech legal case with the City of Hope Medical Center.
The strength of the Swiss franc relative to other currencies, in particular the US dollar and
theJapanese yen, had a negative impact on the results. For example, the US dollar was worth
1.35CHF on average in 2003 compared to 1.56 CHF in 2002. As a result the 25% increase in
theoperating profit before exceptional items of the Group’s continuing businesses translates
intoa17% increase in Swiss franc terms.
The results of the discontinuing Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business, which was sold to DSM
effective 30 September 2003, are included in the Group’s results for the first nine months of 2003.
The Group’s operating profit including Vitamins and Fine Chemicals increased by more than
4.2billion Swiss francs to 5.6 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 319%. Drivers were the positive
results from the core businesses, which were only partially offset by the impacts of the divest-
ment of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business, notably an impairment charge of 375 million
Swiss francs and a loss on the divestment of 20 million Swiss francs. The results in 2002 included
1,770 million Swiss francs of expenses for the vitamin case and 1,650 million Swiss francs for the
Vitamins and Fine Chemical business impairment.
Treasury and Financing
Significant progress has been made in 2003 towards achieving conditions for a balanced financial
income by the end of 2004. Roche is now showing improved financial strength. Steps taken
include further restructuring and reduction of the Group’s debt, the refinancing of the instruments
covering convertible debt obligations, and the reduction of the financial risk exposures.
The achievements were principally based on a strong cash generation by the operating business
and major items like the proceeds from the sale of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business to
DSM. In addition, debt has been significantly reduced and bank loans were switched into capital
market debt. The ‘Bullet’ and ‘LYONs II’ debt instruments were repaid with a total cash outflow
of3.1 billion Swiss francs. The conversion of the ‘Helveticus’ bonds reduced debt by a further
207million Swiss francs. The first issues of the European Medium Term Note programme raised
proceeds of 2.6 billion Swiss francs at attractive conditions, which were used to refinance existing
short-term bank debt with long-term capital market financing. Group net liquidity increased to
5.9billion Swiss francs from 0.6 billion Swiss francs.
The Group has reassessed and refinanced instruments that cover the potential conversion
obligations that may arise from its convertible debt instruments. At 31 December 2002 the Group
had reclassified its forward purchases of non-voting equity securities from equity to debt.
Thiswas done based on developments in international accounting. During 2003 the ‘LYONs II’
convertible bond was redeemed and this freed-up the non-voting equity securities that were
covering the potential conversion obligation. These were partly used in the Disetronic acquisition
and partly sold. The proceeds were used to close all of the forward purchases. The potential
conversion obligation of the ‘LYONs V’ and ‘Sumo’ convertible bonds are now covered by Low
Exercise Price Options. These do not have future cash commitments and are classified as equity
rather than debt. As a result of these transactions, the Group has a stronger and more transparent
balance sheet, and the closing of the forward purchases has reduced interest expenses and
long-term debt. As at 31 December 2003 long-term debt has been reduced by 2.4 billion Swiss
francs and financial long-term assets have been reduced by 0.7 billion Swiss francs. The net cash
outflow was 1.6 billion Swiss francs. Additional details are given in Note 33 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
56 Financial ReviewThe financial risk exposures have been decreased. The proportion of financial assets that are
heldin equities has been further reduced with no net adverse effect to net income. The equity
securities now amount to 1.4 billion Swiss francs or 9% of total cash and marketable securities,
compared to 3.7 billion Swiss francs at the end of 2002 (24% of total cash and marketable
securities). The market risk of these financial assets, measured using a Value-at-Risk (VaR)
model, indicates that with 95% confidence, over the next month a potential loss in asset value will
not exceed 117 million Swiss francs. Impairment charges for financial assets were 313 million
Swiss francs, of which 277 million Swiss francs arose from shares that experienced large falls in
the second half of 2002 and failed to recover sufficiently in the following six months to be above
the Group’s impairment threshold. Impairments in the second half of 2003 were 36 million Swiss
francs.
Foreign exchange risks have also been reduced, as profits were continuously and increasingly
locked-in upon favourable movements of the exchange rates, thereby reducing foreign exchange
transaction exposures. According to Value-at-Risk analysis with 95% confidence, any potential
foreign exchange loss over the next month will not exceed 41 million Swiss francs.
Roche now shows a significantly improved balance sheet and a healthy risk profile.

Sales: Core business sales grew by 19% in local currencies (11% in Swiss francs)
The Roche Group recorded sales of 29.0 billion Swiss francs from its two core businesses in
2003.This represents an increase of 19% in local currencies (11% in Swiss francs) over 2002.
Approximately 12% of the increase was due to organic growth, with 7% due to the integration
ofChugai. Growth was driven both by the Pharmaceuticals Division, where the rate of sales
growth increased significantly, reaching 23% in local currencies (14% in Swiss francs), and by
theDiagnostics Division, which posted an 8% increase in local currencies (3% in Swiss francs).

Financial Review 57Operating profit: Substantial growth and profitability increase
Operating profit before exceptional items from continuing businesses, which excludes the results
from the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals division, increased by 25% in local currencies (17% in
Swiss francs) to 6.1 billion Swiss francs. The growth was driven by increased sales and by lower
other operating expenses. This development was partially offset by increased operating costs,
primarily as a result of the Chugai integration. There were also investments in the marketing of
new products such as Pegasys and Fuzeon, and for activities supporting the development pipeline
of own, newly in-licensed andopt-in compounds. The operating profit before exceptional items
margin increased by 1.1percentage points to 21.1 percent of sales.

Gross profit: Increased by 19% (11% in Swiss francs) to 22.3 billion Swiss francs in 2003

inhigh-margin prescription products and the effects of continuing productivity improvements,
which compensated for the lower than average gross profit margin of Chugai and the Disetronic
acquisition accounting and integration impacts.
Marketing and distribution: Increased by 17% (9% in Swiss francs) to 8.6 billion Swiss francs.
The increase was driven by the support for newly launched products such as Pegasys, Copegus

tech for Xolair, Raptiva and Avastin and at Chugai for Renagel, Xeloda and Pegasys. At Group
level, the acquisition of Chugai contributed some 30% to local growth. Marketing and distribution
as a percentage of sales remained fairly stable at around 30%.
Research and development: Increased by 22% (13% in Swiss francs) to 4.7 billion Swiss francs
tosupport the strong research and development pipelines of Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics
including in-licensed and opt-in compounds. At Group level, the acquisition of Chugai con-
tributed roughly 40% to local growth. Research and development costs as a percentage of sales
at Group level reached with 16% the same level as in 2002. The same is valid for Pharmaceuticals,
which accounts for almost 85% of the Group's research and development expenses, where they
reached 18% of sales, and for Diagnostics, where they reached 10%.
58 Financial ReviewAdministration: Increased by 22% (15% in Swiss francs) to 1.4 billion Swiss francs. At Group
level, the acquisition of Chugai contributed around 30% to local growth. The remainder was
primarily driven by Genentech and the acquisition of Disetronic.
Amortisation of intangible assets: Increased by 9% (1% in Swiss francs) to 1.0 billion Swiss
francs. The amortisation of intangible assets from the Chugai acquisition was 70 million Swiss
francs in 2003 compared to 18 million Swiss francs for the fourth quarter 2002 and from Dise-
tronic (since May 2003) 21 million Swiss francs.
Other operating income: Increased by 10% (0% in Swiss francs) to 1.3 billion Swiss francs, pri-
marily as the second half 2002 gain of 217 million Swiss francs on the disposal of Neupogen was
compensated by the second half 2003 gain of 106 million Swiss francs (80 million US dollars) on
the sale to Protein Design Labs of exclusive worldwide rights to market, develop and sell Zenapax
in all disease indications other than organ transplantation and the first half of 2003 litigation
settlement income from Bayer.
Other operating expenses: Decreased by 3% (8% in Swiss francs) to 1.8 billion Swiss francs.
This reduction was primarily due to 170 million Swiss francs lower foreign exchange losses on
receivables in Latin America and Turkey due to the recovery of the corresponding currencies,
70million Swiss francs lower restructuring expenses, about 30 million Swiss francs each lower
SAP implementation costs and lower impairment charges, partially offset by higher royalty
expenses.

Pharmaceuticals
Sales by the Pharmaceuticals Division reached 21.6 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 23% in
local currencies and of 14% in Swiss francs. EBITDA totalled 6.5 billion Swiss francs, up by 21%
inlocal currencies (13% in Swiss francs) and the margin remained fairly stable at 30.4% of sales.
Operating profit before exceptional items increased by 28% in local currencies (20% in Swiss
francs) to 5.0billion Swiss francs, and the margin rose from 21.9% in 2002 to 23.0% in 2003. The
higher operating profitability was driven by the sales growth. This was in spite of considerably
increased spending for new products and scheduled launches, support for existing products
(particularly NeoRecormon) and for the strong research and development pipeline. Other operat-
ing income and other operating expenses declined in parallel. On the income side, the 2003 gain
on the sale of Zenapax rights to Protein Design Labs only partially compensated the 2002 gain
onNeupogen. On the expense side, the decline was in particular due to the absence of the 2002
restructuring expenses of 102million Swiss francs and the 52 million Swiss francs impairment
charge relating tothe Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring and lower foreign exchange losses
on receivables inLatin America and Turkey.
Total prescription: Local currency sales of prescription medicines rose 23% to 19.8 billion Swiss
francs (14% in Swiss francs). Growth was again driven by Roche’s successful oncology products.
Other products contributing to the strong sales growth included Pegasys/Copegus, NeoRecormon
and CellCept. Sales of the antibiotic Rocephin remained stable, as the continued high demand in
Italy and the growth in the US compensated for the generic competition in Europe, in particular in
France and Germany. The acne medicine Roaccutane/Accutane declined in local terms by 37%,
due to tighter US prescription requirements and generic competition in the US and Europe. Xeni-
cal sales decreased by 13% in line with market trends. The Roche prescription business improved
its operating profit before exceptional items as a percent of sales by 1.1 percentage points to
25.3% due to an increased gross profit margin and lower other operating expenses. The increased
gross profit margin was partially a result of the 2002 additional manufacturing validations, start-
up and scale-up costs for Pegasys and Fuzeon, and increased regulatory compliance costs. The
lower other operating expenses were primarily due to significantly lower foreign exchange losses
on receivables and the 2002 costs relating to the Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring. These
positive effects were partially offset by increased marketing efforts in 2003 for newly launched
products such as Pegasys/Copegus and Fuzeon and increased costs for the strong research and
development pipeline. The Genentech prescription business continued to have very strong sales
and profit growth. The EBITDA margin increased to 39.2% primarily as a result of increased sales
60 Financial Reviewat a higher gross profit margin due to economies of scale in production, and due to a milestone
payment from a research collaboration partner. The EBITDA margin of the Genentech prescription
business underlines their strong contribution to the Group’s operating cash generation. The
Chugai prescription business posted an operating profit before exceptional items of 462 million
Swiss francs, and the EBITDA margin was 19.1%, compared to 13.0% in 2002. This development
was driven by higher sales at an improved gross profit margin and the positive effects of Chugai’s
restructuring programme. The combined effect of the 49 million Swiss francs final write-off of the
remaining fair value adjustments on inventories as a result of the acquisition accounting and the
30 million Swiss francs restructuring expenses recorded in 2003 were roughly at the same level as
the write-off of the fair value adjustments on inventories of 87 million Swiss francs in 2002.
OTC: Sales of non-prescription medicines rose 17% in local currencies (12% in Swiss francs)
to1.8 billion Swiss francs. Roche Consumer Health sales, excluding Chugai, grew by 5% in local
currencies to 1.6 billion Swiss francs due to strong growth in most markets, but especially in
Asia–Pacific and Eastern Europe and driven by Bepanthen, Redoxon and Aleve. OTC operating
profit before exceptional items totalled 267 million Swiss francs, growing by 12% in local
currencies (9% in Swiss francs) compared to 2002. The operating profit before exceptional
items’margin declined by 0.5 percentage points to 15.1% of sales. This decline was driven by
thelower profitability of Chugai’s OTC business and investments to develop orlistat (Xenical)
asan OTC product.
Diagnostics
Sales increased by 8% in local currencies (3% in Swiss francs), more than twice as fast as
theworldwide market for in-vitro Diagnostics, to 7.4 billion Swiss francs. Growth was driven by
the most profitable business areas, namely Diabetes Care, the in-vitro Diagnostics business of
Molecular Diagnostics and the immunodiagnostics business in Centralized Diagnostics. The
downturn in biotech research negatively impacted the growth rates of Applied Science, and the
divestment ofthe non-clinical Drug-of-Abuse-Testing business and OPTI product lines negatively
impacted the growth rate of Near Patient Testing. On Diagnostics level, the sales growth impacts
of these divestments were offset by the acquisition of Disetronic. Before exceptional items, oper-
ating profit increased by 13% in local currencies (6% in Swiss francs) to 1.4 billion Swiss francs
and EBITDA by 12% (6% in Swiss francs) to 2.1 billion Swiss francs. Profitability further improved
with the operating profit and EBITDA margins up by 0.5 and 0.9 percentage points to 19.0%
and28.5% of sales respectively. Higher marketing spend and rising research and development
expenses forthe broadest research and development pipeline in the industry, and higher amor-
tisation of intangible assets as a result of the Disetronic acquisition were offset by reduced SAP
implementation costs, gains from continuing product portfolio and asset realignments and a
litigation settlement income from Bayer.

Amortisation of goodwill: Remained stable at 0.5 billion Swiss francs, although it increased
inlocal currencies by 9%. Goodwill amortisation from the Chugai acquisition accounting was
10million Swiss francs in 2003 compared to 3 million Swiss francs in 2002. In addition there was
38 million Swiss francs of goodwill amortisation from the Disetronic acquisition in May 2003.
Following the implementation of recent accounting changes, companies using accounting princi-
ples generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP) no longer amortise goodwill and are
required to perform an impairment test at least annually. Roche continues to amortise goodwill,
including that held by Genentech, as required by International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS), but presents this as an exceptional item in view of proposed IFRS changes and to improve
comparability with its healthcare peers.
Major legal cases: In 2003, the 216 million Swiss francs income is due to cash received of
225million Swiss francs from litigation settlements at Genentech in the second half of the year
and a net expense of 9 million Swiss francs resulting from the judgement in the Igen litigation
issued in July 2003. In 2002, a 778 million Swiss francs provision was recorded for the Genentech
legal case with the City of Hope Medical Center.
Changes in Group organisation: Net proceeds received from DSM were 1.5 billion euros
(2.4billion Swiss francs), which include the provisional deduction under the agreed price adjust-
ment mechanisms, mainly related to the cash-and-debt-free basis and the working capital levels
of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business. The final amounts arising from these mechanisms,
including the net debt calculation, are subject to review and approval by the Group and DSM,
andare therefore liable to change. After taking into account incidental transaction costs and the
residual obligations that will be retained by the Roche Group, the preliminary assessment made
on 30 September 2003 showed that an additional loss on disposal of 20 million Swiss francs arose
on the disposal of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business. This was in addition to the impair-
ment charge of 375 million Swiss francs recorded in the first half of 2003. The final assessment
will be made in 2004 following the review and approval by the Group and DSM. In 2002 an
income of 586 million Swiss francs was recognised for the Chugai transaction and an impairment
charge of 1,650 million Swiss francs was recorded on the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business.
Operating profit: Major impact from exceptional items
Operating profit from continuing businesses increased by 37% in local currencies (28% in Swiss
francs) to 5.8 billion Swiss francs. This higher growth compared to the growth of 25% in local
currencies (17% in Swiss francs) of the operating profit before exceptional items is mainly a result
of the one-off income of 225 million Swiss francs from the Genentech legal settlements in the
second half of 2003 compared to the 2002 charge for the Genentech legal case with the City of
Hope Medical Center.

Financial income decreased to a net expense of 667 million Swiss francs from a net income of
663million Swiss francs in 2002. However the comparative result includes a gain of 1,199 million
Swiss francs from the LabCorp transactions. Excluding this gain, financial income for 2002 was
anet expense of 536 million Swiss francs.
Net income from equity securities was a loss of 168 million Swiss francs. This result includes
impairment charges of 313 million mainly relating to equity securities that as at 31 December
2002 had a market value below the Group’s 25% impairment threshold but for less than a
sustained six-month period. Excluding these impairment charges, an income of 145 million
Swissfrancs was achieved on equity securities. Interest income was 215 million Swiss francs,
adecrease of 56% relative to the prior year caused by lower holdings of debt securities and falls
in interest rates. Interest expense was reduced by 28% to 980 million Swiss francs, mainly due to
the reduction and restructuring of debt. The fall in interest rates had less impact here, as interest
rates on large parts of the debt are fixed. The Group achieved net foreign exchange gains of
270million Swiss francs, as profits were continuously and increasingly locked-in upon favourable
movements of exchange rates. A full breakdown of financial income is given in Note 14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

despite the increasing profit contribution by Genentech and Chugai at higher tax rates. The
Group’s overall effective tax rate was 30% due to the tax effects of the Vitamins and Fine Chemi-
cals disposal. The Group’s effective tax rate on continuing businesses before exceptional items

64 Financial ReviewOperating cash flows: The Group’s operations continued to show strong cash generation from
business operations of 9.2 billion Swiss francs, driven by continued growth in EBITDA. Cash flows
from operating activities improved greatly when compared to the same period in 2002. This is due
to lower vitamin case payments in 2003 and the inclusion in 2002 of the 1 billion Swiss francs
payment into a collateral account in relation to the Igen litigation which reversed into net inflow
of 0.8 billion Swiss francs in 2003. There was also a much lower net cash outflow for income
taxes, as the large income tax receivables recorded at the end of 2002 were recovered from the
tax authorities.
Financing cash flows: The most significant financing cash flows were the dividend payment of
1.2 billion Swiss francs, the 3.1 billion Swiss francs repayment of the ‘Bullet’ bonds and ‘LYONs II’
notes and the 2.6 billion Swiss francs proceeds from three issues from the Group’s European
Medium Term Note programme, which refinanced existing short-term debt. The refinancing of the
instruments covering convertible debt obligations resulted in a cash outflow of 1.6 billion Swiss
francs (see Note 33 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
Investing cash flows:The most significant cash flows during 2003 were proceeds of 2.1 billion
Swiss francs from the divestment of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business, which consists of
2.2 billion Swiss francs received from DSM, net of the 0.1 billion Swiss francs in cash held by the
divested companies. Investing cash flows also include increased expenditure on property, plant
and equipment and intangible assets. There was a net cash outflow from the Group’s portfolio of
marketable securities in order to fund the purchase of Disetronic, the debt repayments and the
vitamin case payments.

Long-term assets: The sale of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business reduced property,
plant and equipment by 1.3 billion Swiss francs. 0.8 billion Swiss francs in the collateral account
in relation to Igen litigation was repaid to the Group, lowering financial long-term assets.
Theacquisition of Disetronic increased goodwill and other intangible assets by 1.2 billion Swiss
francs. Financial long-term assets were reduced by 0.7 billion Swiss francs as the collateral
supporting the instruments covering convertible debt obligations was released.
Current assets: The sale of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business also had an impact on
current assets, notably by reducing inventories by 1.0 billion Swiss francs.
Equity: The most significant movements were the net income of 3.1 billion Swiss francs and the
1.2 billion Swiss francs dividend payment.
Minority interests: Increase was driven by the improving performance at Genentech and cur-
rency translation effects.
Non-current liabilities: The proceeds from the European Medium Term Note programme
increased long-term debt by 2.6 billion Swiss francs, while the ‘LYONs III’ and ‘LYONs IV’ notes,
with a book value of 3.3 billion Swiss francs, are now classified as short-term debt. The refinanc-
ing of the instruments covering convertible debt obligations reduced long-term debt by 2.4 billion
Swiss francs.
Current liabilities: The repayment of the ‘Bullet’ bonds and ‘LYONs II’ notes decreased short-
term debt by 3.1 billion Swiss francs. Vitamin case payments of 0.6 billion Swiss francs reduced
short-term provisions. The reclassification of the ‘LYONs III’ and ‘LYONs IV’ notes, with a book
value of 3.3 billion Swiss francs, increased current liabilities.

On average in 2003, the Swiss franc was stronger against the US dollar and the Japanese yen
than in 2002, but weaker against the euro. The total negative currency effect on sales growth of
the continuing businesses and on operating profit growth was 8% points. In absolute terms, the
sensitivity of Group sales of continuing businesses to a change of the US dollar against the Swiss
franc by 0.01 Swiss francs for the average of 2003 was approximately 75 million Swiss francs, and
the corresponding sensitivities for euro and yen were approximately 55 million Swiss francs and
30million Swiss francs respectively.
The Group monitors its net currency exposures, and when appropriate, enters into transactions
with the aim of preserving the value of assets, commitments and anticipated transactions. The
Group uses forward contracts, swaps and foreign currency options to optimise certain anticipated
foreign exchange revenues, cash flows and financing transactions. In 2003, the Group pursued
astrategy to continuously lock-in favourable developments of foreign exchange rates by entering
into derivative contracts, thereby reducing the exposure to potential future moves in foreign
exchange rates. As a result, the Group’s overall transaction risk decreased continuously in 2003.
The transaction risk of monetary positions is quantified using a Value-at-Risk (VaR) approach,
which measures the potential negative impact on foreign exchange results due to adverse
changes inforeign exchange rates. The VaR calculation below is based on normal market condi-
tions, a confidence level of 95% and a holding period of 30 days.

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could have adverse effects on
theGroup’s net income or financial position. Changes in interest rates cause variations in interest
income and expenses on interest-bearing assets and liabilities. In addition, they can affect the
market value of certain financial assets, liabilities and instruments. The Group manages its interest
rate risk if necessary using financial derivatives such as swaps and options.
Financial Review 67In 2003, the Group pursued the goal of reducing its debt. As a consequence, the exposure to
potential changes of interest rates decreased continuously and interest rate VaR, measuring
thepotential change of the net market value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, con-
tinuously declined. The potential increase in interest expenses due to movements in interest rates
is not material for the Group as the major debt instruments have fixed interest rates. At Group
level, potential impacts of interest rate changes on financial instruments are monitored and quan-
tified using Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Earnings-at-Risk (EaR) models. VaR measures the potential
change in fair value of interest sensitive financial instruments. EaR reflects the potential change
in net annual interest expenses that could result from adverse interest rate movements. Both VaR
and EaR are measured using a historical simulation approach under normal market conditions
with aconfidence level of 95% and a holding period of 30 days.

Market risk of financial assets
Changes in the market value of cash and marketable securities can affect the net income or
financial position of the Group. Market risk arises from movements in stock prices, interest rates
or foreign exchange rates.
In 2003, the Group decided to change its risk profile by reducing its equity position considerably.
Equity securities now amount to 1.4 billion Swiss francs (2002: 3.7 billion Swiss francs) or 9%
(2002: 24%) of total cash and marketable securities. The continuous shift in the Group’s asset
allocation resulted in a reduction of VaR throughout the year. Market risk is measured using a
Value-at-Risk (VaR) model, based on a 95% confidence level and a holding period of 30 days, and
excludes positions at Genentech and Chugai who run their treasury operations independently.
Thus, VaR represents the expected level of loss which will not be exceeded with 95% probability
over the following 30 days.

Value-at-Risk and Earnings-at-Risk analysis tools
The Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculations are used to indicate within what ranges the value of the
respective assets or liabilities may fluctuate with a certain probability over a certain time period
(holding period). The VaR measure is a statistical measure, implicitly assuming that the value
changes of the recent past are indicative to value changes in the future. Market shocks are not
included in this calculation, unless recently observed. The Group conducts additional stress test-
ing to take such possibilities into consideration. The Group uses statistically relevant observation
periods and applies holding periods, which reflect the time period required to change the respec-
tive risk exposure if deemed appropriate. With longer holding periods, the probability of higher
value changes increases and so does the VaR measure.
68 Financial ReviewEarnings-at-Risk (EaR) is equivalent to the VaR methodology, but rather than potential value
changes, it indicates the potential changes to profits (losses) with a certain probability and over
acertain time period. The same constraints and limitations apply to this methodology.
The VaR and EaR models are based on a historical simulation approach, which simulates the
effects of historical price and rate movements on current positions. For each historical scenario
(representing all price and rate changes of all individual instruments over a specific 30 day period
in the past), all financial instruments are fully revalued (using valuation models) and the total
change in value and earnings is determined.
The Group cannot predict future market movements. The VaR and EaR figures given above do
notrepresent the actual losses, which are expected or might be incurred on financial assets and
liabilities, nor the possible worst loss over the period stated, nor does it consider the effect of
favourable changes in market rates.

1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of the Roche Group have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), including standards and interpretations
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). They have been prepared using
the historical cost convention except that, as disclosed in the accounting policies below, certain
items, including derivatives and available-for-sale investments, are shown at fair value. They were
approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 2 February 2004.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities,
and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. If in the future
such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best judgement at the date
of the financial statements, deviate from the actual circumstances, the original estimates and
assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the year in which the circumstances change.
Where necessary, the comparatives have been reclassified or extended from the previously
reported results to take into account presentational changes.
The Group has changed the presentation of the income statement in these financial statements,
with both the current year and comparative results split into ‘Continuing’ and ‘Discontinuing’
businesses. The impairment of long-term assets and the costs of the Pharmaceuticals Division
restructuring are now classified as part of other operating expenses. Amortisation of goodwill and
intangible assets are now presented separately, as are other operating income and other operat-
ing expenses. Income from associated companies is now presented as part of profit before taxes.
This was done in order to show better comparability of results with other healthcare companies
and to allow readers to make a clearer assessment of the sustainable earnings capacity of the
Group. The 2002 results have been reclassified into the new format. The 2002 operating profit,
netincome and earnings per share are unchanged from the previously reported results.
Consolidation policy
These financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd,
acompany registered in Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’).
The subsidiaries are those companies controlled, directly or indirectly, by Roche Holding Ltd,
where control is defined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an enter-
prise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. This control is normally evidenced when Roche
Holding Ltd owns, either directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or potential vot-
ing rights of a company’s share capital. Special Purpose Entities are consolidated where the sub-
stance of the relationship is that the Special Purpose Entity is controlled by the Group. Companies
acquired during the year are consolidated from the date on which operating control is transferred
to the Group, and subsidiaries to be divested are included up to the date on which control passes
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements 75from the Group. Companies acquired exclusively to be resold in the near future are not consoli-
dated but are classified as assets held for sale and carried at fair value. Inter-company balances
and transactions and resulting unrealised income are eliminated in full.
Investments in associated companies are accounted for by the equity method. These are com-
panies over which the Group exercises significant influence, but which it does not control. This
isnormally evidenced when the Group owns 20% or more of the voting rights or potential voting
rights of the company. Balances and transactions with associated companies that result in un-
realised income are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associated company.
Interests in joint ventures are reported using the line-by-line proportionate consolidation method.
Segment reporting
The Group’s primary format for segment reporting is business segments and the secondary format
is geographical segments. The risks and returns of the Group’s operations are primarily deter-
mined by the different products that the Group produces rather than the geographical location of
the Group’s operations. This is reflected by the Group’s divisional management and organisational
structure and the Group’s internal financial reporting systems.
The Group has two divisions, Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. Until its disposal on 30 September
2003 the Group had a third division, Vitamins and Fine Chemicals. Within the Pharmaceuticals
Division there are four sub-divisions, Roche Prescription, Genentech Prescription, Chugai Pre-
scription and Consumer Health (OTC). The four sub-divisions have separate management and
reporting structures within the Pharmaceuticals Division and are considered separately reportable
segments. Certain corporate activities that cannot be reasonably allocated to the other reportable
segments, such as the costs of Corporate Headquarters, are reported as ‘Others’. TheGroup’s
geographical segments are determined by geographical location and similarity of economic envi-
ronments.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arm’s length basis. Divisional assets
and liabilities consist of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade
receivables/payables and inventories. Other segment assets and liabilities consist of other assets
and liabilities which can be reasonably attributed to the reported business segments. These
include pension assets/liabilities and provisions. Non-segment assets and liabilities mainly
include current and deferred income tax balances, and financial assets and liabilities. These are
principally cash, marketable securities, other investments and debt. Capital expenditure com-
prises additions to goodwill, intangible assets and additions to property, plant and equipment,
including those arising from acquisitions.
Foreign currency translation
Most Group companies use their local currency as their measurement currency. Certain Group
companies use other currencies (namely US dollars, Swiss francs or euros) as their measurement
currencies where this most usefully represents the results and financial positions of these com-
panies, given local economic conditions and circumstances. Local transactions in other curren-
cies are initially reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses
from the settlement of such transactions and gains and losses on translation of monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in other currencies are included in income, except when they are
qualifying cash flow hedges which are deferred into equity.
76 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsUpon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using measurement currencies
other than Swiss francs (foreign entities) are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of
exchange. Sales, costs, expenses, net income and cash flows are translated at the average rates
of exchange for the year. Translation differences due to the changes in exchange rates between
the beginning and the end of the year and the difference between net income translated at the
average and year-end exchange rates are taken directly to equity. On the divestment of a foreign
entity, the identified cumulative currency translation differences relating to that foreign entity are
recognised in income as part of the gain or loss on divestment.
Revenues and cost of sales
Sales represent amounts received and receivable for goods supplied to customers after deducting
trade discounts, cash discounts and volume rebates and excluding sales and value added taxes.
Revenues from the sale of products are recognised upon transfer to the customer of significant
risks and rewards, usually upon shipment. Other revenues are recorded as earned or as the services
are performed. Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and related
production overhead of goods manufactured and services rendered. Start-up costs between vali-
dation and the achievement of normal production capacity are expensed as incurred. Royalty
income is recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the economic substance of the
agreement and is reported as part of other operating income.
Research and development
Research costs are charged against income as incurred. Development costs are capitalised as
intangible assets when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. Such
intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the expected benefit,
and are reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date. Other development costs are
charged against income as incurred since the criteria for their recognition as an asset are not
met.
In-licensing, milestone and other up-front receipts and payments
Certain Group companies, notably Genentech, receive from third-parties up-front, milestone and
other similar non-refundable payments relating to the sale or licensing of products or technology.
Revenue associated with performance milestones is recognised based on achievement of the
milestones, as defined in the respective agreements. Revenue from non-refundable up-front pay-
ments and licence fees is initially reported as deferred income and is recognised in income as
earned over the period of the development collaboration or the manufacturing obligation. Pay-
ments made by Group companies to third parties and associated companies for such items are
charged against income as research and development costs unless it is probable that future eco-
nomic benefits will flow to the Group, which is normally evidenced by regulatory approval. In this
case they are capitalised as development costs and amortised as described above. In practice this
means that most in-licensing and milestone payments for pharmaceutical products are expensed
as incurred, as in most cases they have not yet gained regulatory approval. Receipts and pay-
ments between consolidated subsidiaries, such as between Genentech, Chugai and other Roche
Group subsidiaries, are eliminated on consolidation, except to the extent of any impacts on
minority interests.
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements 77Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and
non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by
employees of the Group. Where the Group provides long-term employee benefits, the cost is
accrued to match the rendering of the services by the employees concerned.
The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans throughout the
world. The cost for the year for defined benefit plans is determined using the projected unit credit
method. This reflects service rendered by employees to the dates of valuation and incorporates
actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of
benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth, and long-term expected rates of return for plan
assets. Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds in the
country concerned. Differences between assumptions and actual experiences and effects of
changes in actuarial assumptions are allocated over the estimated average remaining working
lives of employees, where these differences exceed a defined corridor. Past service costs are
allocated over the average period until the benefits become vested. Pension assets and liabilities
in different defined benefit schemes are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable
right to use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan. Pension assets are only
recognised to the extent that the Group is able to derive future economic benefits in the way
ofrefunds from the plan or reductions of future contributions. The Group’s contributions to the
defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the year to which they relate.
The Group operates several equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Genentech
and Chugai. For fixed plans, such as the Roche Option Plan and the equivalent plans at Genen-
tech and Chugai, no expense is recognised at the date of issue as the exercise price is greater or
equal to the fair value of the underlying equity instrument at the date of issue. Subsequent cash
flows from any exercises of vested grants are recorded to equity or, in the case of Genentech and
Chugai plans, to balance sheet minority interests. For performance related and variable plans,
such as the Roche Performance Share Plan or the Stock Appreciation Rights, an expense is
accrued over the vesting period for the difference between the exercise price and the fair value
ofthe underlying equity instrument. The Group discloses the values of issued options using the
Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes model was developed for traded
options with no vesting or transfer restrictions, and since the various plans used by the Group
include such restrictions, the fair value of any options issued would be lower than an unadjusted
value implied by the Black-Scholes methodology.
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding
taxes payable on the distribution of retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based
onincome, such as property and capital taxes, are included within other operating expenses or
financial income according to their nature.
Provision for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of
retained earnings, principally relating to subsidiaries, is only made where there is a current inten-
tion to remit such earnings.
78 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsDeferred income taxes are provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences between
the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements.
Deferred income tax assets relating to the carry-forward of unused tax losses are recognised to
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused
tax losses can be utilised.
Current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied
by the same taxation authority and when there is a legally enforceable right to offset them.
Deferred income taxes are determined based on the currently enacted tax rates applicable in
each tax jurisdiction where the Group operates.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction and are
depreciated on a straight-line basis, except for land, which is not depreciated. Estimated useful
lives of major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
Buildings and land improvements 40 years
Machinery and equipment 5–15 years
Office equipment 3 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Investment grants or similar assistance for projects are initially recorded as deferred income
(inother non-current liabilities) and are subsequently recognised as income over the useful lives
of the related assets. Repairs and maintenance costs are recognised as expenses as incurred.
Borrowing costs are not capitalised.
Leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all of the risks and
rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the start
of the lease at fair value, or the present value of the minimum lease payments, if lower. The rental
obligation, net of finance charges, is included in debt. Assets acquired under finance leases are
depreciated in accordance with the Group’s above policy on property, plant and equipment. The
interest element of the finance cost is charged against income over the lease term.
Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the
Group are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged
against income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements 79Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The cost of
acquisition is the cash paid plus the fair value at the date of exchange of any other purchase con-
sideration given in exchange for control over the net assets of the acquired company. The cost of
acquisition also includes directly attributable incidental costs. The acquired identifiable assets
and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. Where the Group does not acquire 100% own-
ership of the acquired company, assets and liabilities are recognised at fair value to the extent of
the Group’s interest and the minority interest is recorded as the minority’s proportion of the pre-
acquisition carrying amounts of the acquired assets and liabilities. Goodwill is recorded as the
surplus of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in fair value of identifiable net assets
acquired. Any goodwill and fair value adjustments are recorded as assets and liabilities of the
acquired company and are recorded in the local currency of that company. Goodwill is amortised
over its useful life on a straight-line basis. Estimated useful life of goodwill is between 5–20 years.
Goodwill may also arise upon investments in associated companies, being the surplus of the cost
of investment over the initial value of the investment applying the equity method. Such goodwill
is recorded within investments in associated companies, and the amortisation is included within
the income from associated companies.
Intangible assets
Patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value.
Where these assets have been acquired through a business combination, this will be the fair
value allocated in the acquisition accounting. Where these have been acquired other than
through a business combination, the initial fair value will be cost. Intangible assets are amortised
over their useful lives on a straight-line basis. Estimated useful life is the lower of legal duration
and economic useful life, up to a maximum of 20 years.
Impairment of non-monetary assets
When there is evidence that an asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is
calculated and an impairment assessment is carried out. When the recoverable amount of an
asset, being the higher of its net selling price and its value in use, is less than its carrying
amount, then the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable value. This reduction is reported
in the income statement as an impairment loss. Value in use is calculated using estimated cash
flows, generally over a five-year period, with extrapolating projections for subsequent years.
These are discounted using an appropriate long-term pre-tax interest rate. When an impairment
loss arises the useful life of the asset in question is reviewed and, if necessary, the future
depreciation/amortisation charge is accelerated. The impairment of financial assets is discussed
below in the ‘financial assets’ policy.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. The cost of finished goods and
work in process comprises raw materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs and
overheads based upon normal capacity of production facilities. Borrowing costs are not included.
Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Net realisable value is the estimated
selling price less cost to completion and selling expenses.
80 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsAccounts receivable
Accounts receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubt-
fulaccounts. An allowance is recorded for the difference between the carrying amount and the
recoverable amount where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect
allamounts due.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and time, call and current balances with
banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which
are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a maturity of three months or less
from the date of acquisition. This definition is also used for the cash flow statement.
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The
original cost of acquisition, consideration received for subsequent resale of these equity instru-
ments and other movements are reported as changes in equity. These instruments have been
acquired primarily to meet the obligations that may arise in respect of certain of the Group’s debt
instruments.
As at 31 December 2002 the Group revised the classification of obligations to repurchase own
equity instruments, based on developments in international practice and exposure drafts of pro-
posed changes to IFRS published by the IASB. These were reclassified as liabilities and were
measured at their present value, which was the final obligation discounted using an appropriate
long-term pre-tax interest rate. As discussed in Note 33, these positions have been refinanced
during 2003 and there are no such obligations remaining at 31 December 2003.
Debt instruments
Debt instruments are initially reported at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction
costs. Subsequently they are reported at amortised cost using the effective interest method. To
the extent that debt instruments are hedged under qualifying fair value hedges, the carrying value
of the hedged item is adjusted for the fair value movement attributable to the risk being hedged.
Any discount between the net proceeds received and the principal value due on redemption is
amortised over the duration of the debt instrument and is recognised as part of interest expense
in the income statement.
On issue of convertible debt instruments, the cost of the liability portion is initially calculated
using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible instrument. The remainder of the
net proceeds is allocated to the equity conversion option, which is reported in equity, and to
deferred income tax liabilities. Where the equity conversion option is on shares of a consolidated
subsidiary, the portion of net proceeds attributable to that option is recorded within minority
interest. The liability element is subsequently reported at amortised cost. Amortisation of the debt
discount and release of the deferred tax liabilities are recognised in the income statement over
the duration of the debt instrument. The value of the equity conversion option recorded in equity
is not changed in future periods.
The limited conversion preferred stock is in substance a financial liability rather than an equity
instrument, and therefore it is classified as long-term debt in the balance sheet and the related
dividend payments are treated as interest expense.
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements 81Provisions
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will
probably lead to an outflow of resources that can be reasonably estimated. Provisions are
recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise, taking into account foreign
currency effects and the time value of money, where material. A contingent liability is disclosed
where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events, or where the
amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability. Contingent assets are
not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Fair values
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged
between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by
reference to quoted market prices adjusted for estimated transaction costs that would be incurred
in an actual transaction, or by the use of established estimation techniques such as option pricing
models and estimated discounted values of cash flows. The fair values at the balance sheet date
are approximately in line with their reported carrying values unless specifically mentioned in the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Financial assets
Financial assets, principally investments, including marketable securities, are classified as either
‘Held-for-trading’, ‘Available-for-sale’, ‘Held-to-maturity’ or ‘Originated by the Group’. Held-for-
trading financial assets are acquired principally to generate profit from short-term fluctuations in
price. Held-to-maturity financial assets are securities with a fixed maturity that the Group has the
intent and ability to hold until maturity. Financial assets originated by the Group are loans and
other long-term financial assets created by the Group or acquired from the issuer in a primary
market. All other financial assets are considered as available-for-sale.
All financial assets are initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs. All purchases and
sales are recognised on the settlement date. Held-for-trading financial assets are subsequently
carried at fair value, with all changes in fair value recorded as financial income in the period
inwhich they arise. Held-to-maturity financial assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost
using the effective interest rate method. Available-for-sale financial assets are subsequently
carried at fair value, with all unrealised changes in fair value recorded in equity. When the avail-
able-for-sale financial assets are sold, impaired or otherwise disposed of, the cumulative gains
and losses previously recognised in equity are included in financial income for the current period.
Financial assets originated by the Group are subsequently carried at amortised cost.
Financial assets are assessed for possible impairment at each balance sheet date. An impairment
charge is recorded where there is objective evidence of impairment, such as where the issuer is
in bankruptcy, default or other significant financial difficulty. For financial assets carried at amor-
tised cost, any impairment charge is the difference between the carrying value and the recover-
able amount, being calculated using estimated future cash flows discounted using an appropriate
long-term pre-tax interest rate. For available-for-sale financial assets, any impairment charge is
the amount currently carried in equity for the difference between the original cost, net of any
previous impairment, and the fair value.
82 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsAs at 31 December 2002 the Group revised its accounting estimates for impairment of financial
assets, based on developments in international practice and exposure drafts of proposed changes
to IFRS published by the IASB. In addition to the above impairment triggers, any available-for-
sale financial assets that have a market value of more than 25% below their original cost, net of
any previous impairment, for a sustained six-month period will be considered as impaired. Any
decreases in the market price of less than 25% of original cost, net of any previous impairment,
orfor less than a sustained six-month period are not by themselves considered as objective
evidence of impairment, and such movements in fair value are recorded in equity until there
isobjective evidence of impairment or until the asset is sold or otherwise disposed of.
Derivatives
All derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs.
Derivatives are subsequently carried at fair value. Apart from those derivatives designated as
qualifying cash flow hedging instruments (see below), all changes in fair value are recorded
asfinancial income in the period in which they arise.
Hedging
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types. Fair value
hedges are hedges of particular risks that may change the fair value of a recognised asset or
liability. Cash flow hedges are hedges of particular risks that may change the amount or timing
offuture cash flows. Hedges of net investment in a foreign entity are hedges of particular risks
that may change the carrying value of the net assets of a foreign entity.
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on
documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. If
these conditions are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this
case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were
nohedging relationship. In particular any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in
fair value included in financial income.
For qualifying fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged
item is recorded at its previous carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair value that are
attributable to the hedged risk. Any changes in the fair values are reported in financial income.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion
ofany change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity, and any remaining
ineffective portion is reported in financial income. If the hedging relationship is the hedge of a
firm commitment or highly probable forecasted transaction, the cumulative changes offair value
of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in the initial carrying
value of the asset or liability at the time it is recognised. For all other qualifying cash flow hedges,
the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity
are included in financial income at the time when the forecasted transaction affects net income.
For qualifying hedges of net investment in a foreign entity, the hedging instrument is recorded at
fair value. The portion of any change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity.
Any remaining ineffective portion is recorded in financial income where the hedging instrument is
a derivative and in equity in other cases. If the entity is disposed of, then the cumulative changes
of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in financial
income at the time of the disposal.
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements 83Changes in accounting policy
In line with developing international practice, cash discounts are now classified as a deduction
from sales. Previously cash discounts were reported as marketing and distribution expenses. The
2002 comparative figures in these financial statements for sales and marketing and distribution
expenses were both reduced by 272 million Swiss francs. There is no impact to operating profit
and net income from this reclassification. Comparative segment and discontinuing operations
information has also been restated.
International Financial Reporting Standards
There were no revised or new standards or interpretations that became effective from 1 January
2003 that had a significant effect on the Group’s financial statements. In late 2003 the Inter-
national Accounting Standards Board has published a revised version of IAS 32 ‘Financial
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’, a revised version of IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement’ and ‘Improvements to International Accounting Standards’,
whichmakes changes to 14 existing standards. These must be adopted for 2005, with possible
early adoption in 2004. The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of these new
standards. Several exposure drafts have also been published, notably ED 2 ‘Share-based Payment’
and ED 3 ‘Business Combinations’ for which final standards are expected in early 2004.
2. Financial risk management
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies and guidelines approved by
senior management. These policies and guidelines cover foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk,
market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Group policies and guidelines also cover areas such as
cash management, investment of excess funds and the raising of short- and long-term debt.
Group companies report details of the financial instruments outstanding and financial liquidity
toGroup Treasury on at least a monthly basis. The Group’s subsidiaries Genentech and Chugai
have their own treasury operations. These have operational independence, whilst working within
afinancial risk management framework that is consistent with the rest of the Group. The com-
pliance with the Group’s financial risk management policies and guidelines is overseen by the
Financial Risk Manager.
The Group, in accordance with its risk management guidelines, continues to monitor these risks,
and when deemed appropriate, certain of the above risks are significantly altered through the use
of financial instruments, such as derivatives. Group management believes that, in order to create
the optimum value for the Group, it is not desirable to eliminate or mitigate all possible market
fluctuations. The Group does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative pur-
poses; short-term positions are sometimes entered to take advantage of market opportunities in
asset management.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates across the world and is exposed to movements in foreign currencies affect-
ingits net income and financial position, as expressed in Swiss francs. The Group continues to
monitor its currency exposures, and when appropriate, enters into transactions with the aim of
preserving the value of assets, commitments and anticipated transactions. The Group uses
forward contracts and foreign currency options to optimise certain anticipated foreign exchange
revenues, cash flows and financing transactions.
84 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsTransaction exposure arises because the amount of local currency paid or received for trans-
actions denominated in foreign currencies may vary due to changes in exchange rates. For many
Group companies income will be primarily in the local currency. A significant amount of expendi-
ture, especially for purchase of goods for resale and interest on and repayment of loans will be in
foreign currencies. Similarly, transaction exposure arises on net balances of monetary assets
heldin foreign currencies. Group companies manage this exposure at a local level, if necessary by
means of financial instruments such as options and forward contracts. In addition, Group Treasury
monitors total worldwide exposure with the help of comprehensive data received on a monthly
basis.
Translation exposure arises from the consolidation of the foreign currency denominated finan-
cial statements of the Group’s foreign subsidiaries. The effect on the Group’s consolidated equity
is shown as a currency translation movement. The Group hedges significant net investments in
foreign currencies by taking foreign currency loans or issuing foreign currency denominated debt
instruments. Major translation exposures are monitored on a regular basis.
A significant part of the Group’s cash outflows for research, development, production and admin-
istration is denominated in Swiss francs, while a much smaller proportion of the Group’s cash
inflows are Swiss franc denominated. As a result, an increase in the value of the Swiss franc rela-
tive to other currencies has an adverse impact on consolidated net income. Similarly, a relative
fall in the value of the Swiss franc has a favourable effect on results published in Swiss francs.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could have adverse effects on
theGroup’s net income or financial position. Changes in interest rates cause variations in interest
income and expenses on interest-bearing assets and liabilities. In addition, they can affect the
market value of certain financial assets, liabilities and instruments as described in the following
section on market risk. The interest rates on the Group’s major debt instruments are fixed, as
described in Note 31, which reduces the Group’s exposure to changes in interest rates. Group
companies manage their short-term interest rate risk at a local level, if necessary using financial
instruments such as interest rate forward contracts, swaps and options.
Market risk of financial assets
Changes in the market value of certain financial assets and derivative instruments can affect the
net income or financial position of the Group. Financial long-term assets are held for strategic
purposes and marketable securities are held for fund management purposes. The risk of loss in
value is reduced by reviews prior to investing and continuous monitoring of the performance of
investments and changes in their risk profile. Investments in equities, bonds, debentures and
other fixed income instruments are entered into on the basis of approved guidelines with regard
to liquidity and credit rating.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counter-party to a transaction may be unable or
unwilling to meet their obligations causing a financial loss to the Group. Trade receivables are
subject to a policy of active risk management focussing on the assessment of country risk, credit
availability, ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures. There are no signifi-
cant concentrations within trade receivables of counter-party credit risk, due to the Group’s large
number of customers and their wide geographical spread. Country risk limits and exposures are
continuously monitored. The exposure of other financial assets to credit risk is controlled by set-
ting a policy for limiting credit exposure to high-quality counter-parties, on-going reviews of
credit ratings, and limiting individual aggregate credit exposure accordingly.
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements 85Liquidity risk
Group companies need to have sufficient availability of cash to meet their obligations. Individual
companies are responsible for their own cash management, including the short-term investment
of cash surpluses and the raising of loans to cover cash deficits, subject to guidance by the
Group and, in certain cases, to approval at Group level. The Group maintains sufficient reserves
of cash and readily realisable marketable securities to meet its liquidity requirements at all times.
In addition, the strong international creditworthiness of the Group allows it to make efficient use
of international capital markets for financing purposes.
3. Changes in Group organisation in millions of CHF
A listing of the major Group subsidiaries and associated companies is included in Note 40.
Changes in Group organisation had the following one-time impacts on the income statement:
2003 2002
Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business – impairment of net assets7 (375) (1,650)
Disposal of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business7 (20) –
Chugai transaction6 – 586
Total (395) (1,064)
The disposal of the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business is discussed in Note 7, and the invest-
ment in Chugai is discussed in Note 6.
Disetronic: Effective 2 May 2003 the Group acquired a controlling interest in Disetronic, a public
company headquartered in Burgdorf, Switzerland. Disetronic is a world leader in the research,
development and commercialisation of insulin pumps and injection systems for the treatment of
diabetes. Disetronic’s Infusion Systems division has become part of Roche Diagnostics’ Diabetes
Care business area. Sales of Disetronic’s Infusion Systems division for the year ended 31 March
2003 were 242 million Swiss francs. As part of the acquisition process Disetronic’s Injection
Systems was simultaneously resold to Disetronic’s founder and chairman and continues to operate
as an independent company. The Group has a 100% interest in Disetronic.
The acquisition was approved by an extraordinary general meeting of Disetronic’s shareholders
on 23 April 2003 and has been cleared by the relevant antitrust authorities. The Group paid the
shareholders of Disetronic 670 Swiss francs in cash and two Roche non-voting equity securities
for each Disetronic share. The net consideration paid was 1,132 million Swiss francs, of which
892million Swiss francs was in cash and 240 million Swiss francs was in the form of 2,744,893
Roche non-voting equity securities. In addition incidental costs were 4 million Swiss francs. The
allocation of the total purchase consideration of1,136 million Swiss francs is as follows:
Net assets acquired
Goodwill 861
Intangible assets 320
Deferred income taxes (83)
Cash 12
Other net assets (liabilities) 26
Total 1,136
Goodwill and acquired intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over 15 years and
10 years respectively.
86 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsFollowing the acquisition, a restructuring programme was announced, which resulted in restruc-
turing charges of 40 million Swiss francs. These are recorded as part of other operating expenses.
The restructuring programme will be substantially completed by mid 2004.
Igen: The Group will acquire a controlling interest in Igen upon the closing of the transaction,
which is expected to be on 13 February 2004. This is described in Note 39 as a subsequent event.
Isotechnika: Between March 2002 and July 2003 the Group acquired a 10% interest in Isotech-
nika Inc. (‘Isotechnika’) for a total of 32 million Swiss francs. Isotechnika is a life sciences com-
pany headquartered in Canada that develops immunosuppressive therapeutic drugs for use in
organ transplant patients and in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Following the acquisition
the Group is expected to have material transactions with Isotechnika for access, development,
and milestone payments with respect to its renal transplantation drug ISA(TX)247. The materiality
of these transactions is such that the Group has potential to exercise significant influence over
Isotechnika and accordingly Isotechnika is reported as an associated company. 22 million Swiss
francs of goodwill arose on the acquisition, which together with the balance of the acquisition
price, is reported as an investment in associated companies.
Antisoma: On 23 December 2002 the Group acquired a 9% interest in Antisoma plc (‘Antisoma’)
for 9 million Swiss francs. Antisoma is a British biopharmaceutical company that develops prod-
ucts for the treatment of cancer. Following the acquisition the Group is expected to have material
transactions with Antisoma for access, development, and milestone payments with respect to its
oncology product portfolio. The materiality of these transactions is such that the Group has
potential to exercise significant influence over Antisoma and accordingly Antisoma is reported
asan associated company. 7 million Swiss francs of goodwill arose on the acquisition, which
together with the balance of the acquisition price, is reported as an investment in associated
companies.
The cash flows from changes in Group organisation are shown in the table below. These amounts
are net of any cash balances in the acquired/divested company/business.

90 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements5. Genentech
Effective 7 September 1990 the Group acquired a majority interest of approximately 60% of
Genentech, Inc., a biotechnology company in the United States. On 13 June 1999 the Group exer-
cised its option to acquire the remaining shares of Genentech on 30 June 1999, at which point
Genentech became a 100% owned subsidiary of the Group. On 23 July 1999, 26 October 1999 and
29 March 2000 the Group completed public offerings of Genentech’s Common Stock, as a result
of which the Group’s majority interest was 60%. Genentech issues additional shares of common
stock in connection with its equity compensation plans and also may issue additional shares for
other purposes. The affiliation agreement between the Group and Genentech provides, amongst
other things, that Genentech establish a stock repurchase programme to maintain the Group’s
percentage ownership interest in Genentech. At 31 December 2003 the Group’s interest in
Genentech was 58.4% (2002: 59.8%).
The common stock of Genentech is publicly traded and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
under the symbol DNA. Genentech prepares financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP). These are filed on a quarterly basis
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Due to certain consolidation entries and
differences in the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US
GAAP, there are differences between Genentech’s stand-alone results on a US GAAP basis and
the results of Genentech as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS. These

Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements 91Differences between IFRS and US GAAP
Following the acquisition by the Group of 100% interest in Genentech on 30 June 1999, the
analysis carried out for the acquisition accounting identified amounts attributable to in-process
research and development (IPR&D). In Genentech’s US GAAP financial statements these items
have been recorded in 1999 as either an adjustment to equity or as a one-time expense. Under
IFRS these items cannot be classified as separate assets at the date of acquisition and therefore
form part of goodwill. Therefore in the years subsequent to 1999 there is a goodwill amortisation
expense in respect of this IPR&D in the Group’s results under IFRS. Genentech adopted US
accounting standards FAS 141 and FAS 142 effective 1 January 2002, under which goodwill is no
longer amortised, but is subject to an impairment test at least annually. Under IFRS goodwill contin-
ues to be amortised, while also being subject to testing for impairment.
Effective 1 July 2003 Genentech has applied FASB Interpretation No. 46 (or FIN 46) on ‘Consoli-
dation of Variable Interest Entities’ to its US GAAP financial statements. As a result Genentech
has consolidated certain of its leasing structures in its US GAAP financial statements, as is dis-
closed in detail in Genentech’s SEC filings. As reported in the Group’s annual financial state-
ments for 2002 and 2001 Genentech’s leasing structures are already consolidated within the
Group’s results in accordance with IFRS. The property, plant and equipment concerned has been
capitalised and is being depreciated and the lease finance is reported within long-term debt.
There are other differences between IFRS and US GAAP, but these have a relatively minor impact.
Genentech stock repurchases and stock options
On 5 December 2003 Genentech’s Board of Directors authorised a stock repurchase programme
to repurchase up to 1,000 million US dollars of Genentech’s common stock. By 31 December 2003
Genentech had repurchased common stock worth 6 million US dollars (8 million Swiss francs).
Earlier in 2003 Genentech repurchased common stock worth 195 million US dollars (263 million
Swiss francs) as part of an earlier stock repurchase programme which expired on 30 June 2003.
During 2002 Genentech has repurchased 693 million US dollars (1,079 million Swiss francs) of
their own common stock.
Genentech has a stock option plan adopted in 1999 and amended in 2000. The plan allows for
thegranting of various stock options, stock awards and stock appreciation rights to employees,
directors and consultants of Genentech. Details are as shown in the table below.

Other matters
As discussed in Note 8, the Group has recorded income of 225 million Swiss francs (2002:
expense of 778 million Swiss francs) in respect of certain litigation matters at Genentech.
On 19 January 2000 the Group issued ‘LYONs IV’ zero coupon US dollar notes that are exchange-
able into Genentech shares. If all of these notes were converted the Group’s percentage owner-
ship in Genentech would decrease by approximately 2.5%. See also Note 31.
6. Chugai
On 10 December 2001, Roche and Chugai announced that they would enter into an alliance to
create a leading research-driven Japanese pharmaceutical company, which would be formed by
the merger of Chugai (excluding Gen-Probe) and Roche’s Japanese pharmaceuticals subsidiary,
Nippon Roche. Under the terms of the alliance, both Chugai and Nippon Roche were indepen-
dently valued. Roche agreed to make additional cash contributions in order to bring Roche’s par-
ticipation to 50.1% of the agreed combined value. The alliance was approved by the shareholders
of Chugai at their Annual General Meeting on 27 June 2002.
The newly merged company, known as Chugai, is a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group.
Roche is the majority shareholder with 50.5% ownership as at 31 December 2003, with a 49.5%
minority interest.
Transaction process
In late-September 2002, Roche acquired through a public tender offer approximately 10% (30 mil-
lion shares) of Chugai’s outstanding shares at the price of JPY 2,800 per share. The total cash out-
flow from the Group as a result of this tender offer was 84.0 billion Japanese yen (1,027 million
Swiss francs). Immediately after the tender offer, Roche subscribed to an issue by Chugai of
21.1million new shares at a price of JPY 1,780 per share, which resulted in a cash contribution
toChugai of 37.6 billion Japanese yen (459 million Swiss francs). On 16 September 2002, before
closing the tender offer by Roche, Chugai completed the spin-off of its 100% shareholdings inGen-
Probe, its California-based diagnostics subsidiary, to its registered shareholders as of 31July 2002.
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements 93On 1 October 2002, Chugai merged with Nippon Roche. Prior to the merger Nippon Roche issued
convertible bonds to the Roche Group (‘Roche CB’), the obligation to which succeeded to Chugai. On
1 October 2002 Roche acquired additional shares of Chugai by the conversion of such bonds in pro-
portion to the shares issued by Chugai from the conversion of the convertible bonds previously issued
by Chugai to third parties (‘Chugai CB’), such that Roche’s ownership reached 50.1%. This resulted in
a cash contribution of 37.7 billion Japanese yen (460 million Swiss francs). On an on-going basis
Roche will convert the remaining Roche CB into Chugai shares corresponding to the conversion of
the remaining Chugai CB such that Roche maintains at least a 50.1% ownership in Chugai.
Purchase consideration
The closing of the transaction was on 1 October 2002. The transaction is accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting. The consideration paid by Roche for 50.1% of Chugai consists of
firstly the public tender offer, secondly the 49.9% of the subscription to new Chugai shares and con-
version of the Roche CB that relates to minority shareholders and thirdly the 49.9% of the net assets
of Nippon Roche that are now attributable to minority shareholders. As Nippon Roche was not a
public company, the 49.9% of the net assets of Nippon Roche were valued with reference to the fair
value of the Chugai shares acquired in exchange. This allocation is shown in the table below.
JPY billions CHF millions
Public tender offer 84.0 1,027
Subscription (49.9% of 37.6 billion JPY) 18.7 229
Convertible bonds (49.9% of 37.7 billion JPY) 18.8 230
Implied value of 49.9% of Nippon Roche 101.1 1,236
Transaction costs 1.7 21
Purchase consideration for 50.1% of Chugai 224.3 2,743
Acquisition accounting
The market value of the Chugai shares acquired was 182.9 billion Japanese yen (2,237 million
Swiss francs), which corresponds to 50.1% of the market capitalisation of Chugai prior to the
transaction. The purchase consideration of 224.3 billion Japanese yen (2,743 million Swiss francs)
therefore represents a surplus of 41.4 billion Japanese yen (506 million Swiss francs) over the
market value of the Chugai shares acquired. This surplus was written-off, so that the recorded net
assets of Chugai do not exceed the market capitalisation. As a result of the transaction a gain
of89.3 billion Japanese yen (1,092 million Swiss francs) arises on the part disposal of Nippon
Roche. Accordingly net income of 47.9 billion Japanese yen (586 million Swiss francs) was
recognised in the income statement for these two amounts.
The acquired net assets of Chugai are shown in the table below. The amount allocated to good-
will includes 10.2 billion Japanese yen (125 million Swiss francs) that is attributable to in-process
research and development. Under International Financial Reporting Standards these items cannot
be classified as separate assets at the date of acquisition and therefore form part of goodwill.

94 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsOngoing impacts of purchase accounting
From 1 October 2002, Chugai’s results are included in the Group’s consolidated financial state-
ments. ‘Chugai prescription’ is shown as a separate business segment in the segment informa-
tion. The ‘Chugai prescription’ business segment includes the results of the newly merged Chugai
company (which includes the former Nippon Roche business) from 1 October 2002, and also
includes the results of Nippon Roche for the periods until 30 September 2002. The results of
Chugai’s OTC business are included in the ‘OTC’ business segment. Segment information is given
in Note 4. The fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition accounting have the following

The fair value adjustments to inventories have been fully written-off, in line with the inventory
turnover, by the end of the first quarter of 2003. Goodwill and acquired intangible assets are
amortised on a straight-line basis over 15 years and between 10 and 18 years respectively.
Local statutory financial year
On 25 June 2003 Chugai’s annual general meeting approved a change to its local statutory finan-
cial year-end from 31 March to 31 December. Accordingly, Chugai will have a nine-month local
fiscal term beginning 1 April 2003, and thereafter a twelve-month fiscal term beginning 1 January
2004. For reporting to the Roche Group, Chugai will continue to report using International Finan-
cial Reporting Standards drawn up to the same date as the rest of the Roche Group.
Dividends
The dividends distributed to third-parties holding Chugai shares during 2003 totalled 2,198 mil-
lion Japanese yen, or 26 million Swiss francs (1 October–31 December 2002: 2,199 million
Japanese yen or 27 million Swiss francs) and has been recorded against minority interests (see
Note 36). Dividends paid by Chugai to Roche are eliminated on consolidation as inter-company
items.
Restructuring plan
On 29 January 2003 Chugai announced further details of its restructuring plans involving the
closure and sale of certain plants and facilities in Japan. On 10 April 2003 Chugai announced
theadditional closure plan of research operations of its US subsidiary. Within the Group’s
2003results restructuring costs of 2.6 billion Japanese yen (30 million Swiss francs) have been
recorded. The restructuring programme has been substantially completed by 31 December 2003.
Share repurchase
During 2003 Chugai repurchased 4,300,000 of its common shares for a total consideration of
5.8billion Japanese yen (68 million Swiss francs). As a result the Group’s ownership in Chugai
increased to 50.5% and goodwill increased by 21 million Swiss francs. The Chugai annual general
shareholders’ meeting on 25 June 2003 authorised the repurchase of up to 5,000,000 common
shares for a maximum of 7 billion Japanese yen.
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements 95Stock acquisition rights
During 2003 Chugai adopted a Stock Acquisition Rights programme. The programme allows for
the granting of rights to employees and directors of Chugai. Each right entitles the holder to
purchase 100 Chugai shares at a specified exercise price.
Details are shown in the table below.

7. Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division in millions of CHF
Effective 30 September 2003, after receiving the final regulatory approvals, the Group completed
the sale of its global Vitamins and Fine Chemicals business (‘the VFC business’) to the Dutch
company DSM.
The consideration for the sale was 1,742 million euros (2,681 million Swiss francs), which con-
sisted of 1,650 million euros (2,540 million Swiss francs) in cash, and 2.24 million shares in DSM
with a market value of 92 million euros (141 million Swiss francs). Under the terms of the final
purchase agreement, the DSM shares acquired by the Group are blocked for between one and
two years.
96 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsThe sale was made on a cash-and-debt-free basis, and therefore the cash received from DSM
was reduced by 164 million euros (252 million Swiss francs) to reflect the net debt in the VFC
business. Furthermore, under the terms of the final purchase agreement with DSM, there were
certain agreed purchase price adjustment mechanisms, mainly related to working capital levels of
the VFC business. These mechanisms resulted in a further purchase price reduction of 40 million
euros (62 million Swiss francs). The final amounts arising from these mechanisms, including the
net debt calculation, are subject to review and approval by the Group and DSM, and are therefore
liable to change.
An impairment charge of 1,650 million Swiss francs was recorded at 31 December 2002 and a
further impairment charge of 375 million Swiss francs was recorded at 30 June 2003. These were
based on assessments at the respective dates of the difference between the expected net pro-
ceeds from disposal and the net assets of the VFC business, taking into account the residual
obligations that will be retained by the Roche Group. The preliminary assessment made on
31December 2003 showed that an additional loss on disposal of 20 million Swiss francs arose
onthe disposal of the VFC business. The final assessment will be made in 2004 following review
and approval by the Group and by DSM.
The transaction is summarised in the table below:
EUR millions CHF millions
Consideration 1,742 2,681

Net assets of the VFC business, net of impairment charges
and accruals for residual obligations retained by the Roche Group (2,345)

The preliminary assessment of the disposal results in a tax benefit currently estimated at 41 mil-
lion Swiss francs. The cash inflow from the disposal, net of cash balances of 113 million Swiss
francs held by companies within the VFC business, was 2,113 million Swiss francs.
Following the sale of the VFC business, certain assets and liabilities of the Vitamins and Fine
Chemicals Division, mainly associated with the vitamin case, remain with the Group. These are
described below in the section on the vitamin case. In addition the Group has given DSM certain
indemnities in respect of any remedial actions at the sites of the VFC business that may be
required by environmental laws. Further arrangements were put in place regarding utilisation of
certain assets and certain purchasing contracts as well as adopting DSM as a preferred supplier
for pharmaceutical ingredients. Under one of these arrangements, the Group has guaranteed to
purchase for a period of four years beginning 1 January 2004 products with a sales value totalling
100 million euros. The Group will reimburse DSM for 75% of any unutilised amounts. The other
arrangements consist of certain residual obligations, which are fully accrued for.

98 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsVitamin case
Following the settlement agreement with the US Department of Justice on 20 May 1999 regarding
pricing practices in the vitamin market and the overall settlement agreement to a class action
suitbrought by the US buyers of bulk vitamins, the Group recorded provisions in respect of the
vitamin case in 1999. These provisions were the Group’s best estimate at that time of the total
liability that may arise, taking into account currency movements and the time value of money.
Provisions for legal fees were recorded separately. At 31 December 2001 and 31 December 2002,
based on the development of the litigation and recent settlement negotiations, the Group
recorded additional provisions of 760 and 1,770 million Swiss francs, respectively.
On 17 January 2003 the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that non-US plaintiffs
may bring claims in US courts under US anti-trust laws for alleged damages suffered from trans-
actions outside the United States in connection with the vitamin case. The defendants, including
Roche, have filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to review the case. On 15 December 2003
the Supreme Court decided to consider the appeal by the defendants. No provisions have been
recorded in respect of this litigation as the eventual outcome is uncertain at this stage.
Total payments during the year were 638 million Swiss francs (2002: 3,266 million Swiss francs),
which were charged against the provisions previously recorded. Payments made in 2003 include
403 million US dollars (545 million Swiss francs) to direct customers in the United States.
The Group is seeking to resolve the remaining outstanding issues, however the timing and the
final amounts involved are uncertain. The remaining provisions recorded total 170 million Swiss
francs and are based on current litigation and recent settlement agreements. These provisions
areall considered as short-term as cash outflows are expected to arise during 2004 and are not
discounted as the time value of money is not considered material in this case. As the litigation
and negotiations progress it is possible that the ultimate liability may be different from the
amount of provisions currently recorded.
As part of the disposal process, the liabilities in respect of the vitamin case remain with the
Roche Group. Roche and DSM have signed an Indemnity and Co-operation Agreement under
which Roche may provide DSM with certain indemnities and guarantees in connection with the
vitamin case.

Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements 99Igen litigation
On 15 February 2002 the United States District Court of Maryland entered judgement in the civil
litigation between Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany (RDG) and Igen International, Inc. (Igen)
over claims related to the licensing of Igen’s electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology to RDG.
The court concluded that several breaches of the licence agreement were material so that Igen
has the right to terminate the licence agreement, and awarded Igen 105.4 million US dollars in
compensatory damages and 400 million US dollars in punitive damages.
On 9 July 2003 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the substantial
damages awarded against RDG. The court reversed the finding that RDG had engaged in unfair
competition through the continuation of a patent lawsuit against Igen by one of RDG’s affiliated
companies. In setting aside that claim, the Court eliminated the only basis for the award of
400million US dollars in punitive damages against RDG. The court also held that RDG did not
violate an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the License Agreement, thereby
also setting aside the award of 82 million US dollars in compensatory damages on that claim. In
total the Court eliminated 486 million USdollars of the 505 million US dollars judgement entered
against RDG. The Court left intact thejury’s award of the remaining damages and the finding that
Igen may terminate the License Agreement with RDG. Igen notified RDG that Igen will terminate
the License Agreement. On 24July 2003 the Group and Igen announced plans under which
theGroup will acquire Igen. Thisacquisition is expected to be completed on 13 February 2004
(see Note 39).
As the previous license agreement has been terminated, the Group has written-off the intangible
assets for this technology that were recorded at the time of the acquisition of the Corange Group
by the Roche Group in 1997. The net book value of these was 117 million Swiss francs. At the
same time the Group released to income 108 million Swiss francs of litigation provisions, being
the balance in the provision less the remaining outstanding compensatory damages awards. The
net of these two amounts, an expense totalling 9 million Swiss francs, has been recorded as an
expense from major legal cases.
In March 2002 RDG paid 606 million US dollars into a collateral deposit account in relation to
theIgen litigation. Following entry of the final judgement RDG paid the remaining 18.6 million
USdollars (25 million Swiss francs) in respect of the remaining compensatory damages to Igen.
The amount in the collateral deposit account was repaid to the Group. The net cash inflow of
these two transactions was 808 million Swiss francs.
Genentech legal cases
In 2003 the Group has recorded income of 225 million Swiss francs in respect of certain litigation
settlements, including litigation involving Amgen. In 2002 the Group recorded a provision of
778million Swiss francs in respect of certain litigation matters, including litigation involving
theCity of Hope.
On 10 June 2002 Genentech announced that a Los Angeles County Superior Court jury voted
toaward City of Hope Medical Center approximately 300 million US dollars in compensatory
damages based on a finding of a breach of a 1976 agreement between Genentech and the City
ofHope. On 24 June 2002 the jury voted to award City of Hope 200 million US dollars in punitive
damages in the same case. On 13 September 2002 Genentech filed a notice of appeal of the jury
verdict and damages awards with the California Court of Appeal. The appeals process is on-going
and will take from one to four years depending on the scope of the review. A full provision has
100 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statementsbeen recorded for these awards. During the appeals process interest accrues on the total amount
of the damages at a simple annual rate of 10%. Following the judgement interest of 54 million
USdollars or73 million Swiss francs (2002: 26 million US dollars or 40 million Swiss francs) was
recorded asthe time cost of provisions, within interest expenses (see Note 14). On 3 October
2002 Genentech entered into an arrangement with third party insurance companies to post a
surety bond of 600 million US dollars in connection with this judgement. As part of this arrange-
ment Genentech pledged 630 million US dollars in cash and investments to secure this bond.
These amounts, which are equivalent to 779 million Swiss francs, are reported as restricted cash
within financial long-term assets (see Note 21).
In addition, Genentech is party to a patent infringement suit filed by Chiron Corporation on 7 June
2000 in the US District Court in the Eastern District of California (Sacramento) in respect of
Herceptin. On 25 June 2002 the court issued several decisions regarding summary judgement
motions that had been filed. The jury trial of this suit began on 6 August 2002. Following the first
phase of the trial, based on the findings by the jury, the Court entered judgement in favour of
Genentech. On 20 November 2002 Chiron filed notice of appeal with the US Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit. On 4 December 2002 Genentech filed notice of cross-appeal with the same
court. The appeal process is ongoing.
On 12 August 2002 the United States Patent and Trademark Office declared an interference
between the Chiron patent involved in this lawsuit and a patent application exclusively licensed to
Genentech from the University of Pennsylvania relating to anti-HER2 antibodies. In declaring the
interference, the Patent Office has determined that there is substantial question as to whether the
inventors of the Chiron patent were the first to invent the technology involved and are entitled to
the patent. In connection with a second patent infringement lawsuit filed on 13 March 2001
against Genentech by Chiron, discovery in this case is currently stayed.
On 13 January 2003 arbitration proceedings began between Genentech and Tanox Biosystems,
Inc. (’Tanox’) regarding a July 1996 Settlement and Cross-Licensing Agreement relating to the
development and manufacture of certain antibody products directed towards immunoglobin E,
including Xolair and Hu-901. Tanox have claimed breaches of the Agreement and Genentech have
made counterclaims. Genentech continues to work through the arbitration process with Tanox.
Both parties have agreed to postpone a decision on the arbitration and the earliest the decision
will be made is late February 2004. No provisions have been recorded in respect of this arbitra-
tion, as the outcome cannot be determined as of the date of these financial statements.
On 27 August 2003 Genentech and Amgen, Inc. announced a settlement of their patent litigation
in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. Under the settlement agreement,
both parties agreed to dismiss their claims and counterclaims against each other. As part of the
settlement Amgen made a one-time payment to Genentech. In November 2003 Genentech and
Bayer settled a breach of contract action that Genentech brought against Bayer relating to
Bayer’s manufacture and sale of Factor VIII under a license agreement between Bayer and
Genentech. As part of the settlement, Bayer made a one-time payment to Genentech. Income
from major legal cases of 225 million Swiss francs has been recorded in respect of these
settlements.
Genentech is party to other litigation, as described in Genentech’s annual report and quarterly
SEC filings, however these other matters are not as far advanced as the matters referred to above.

The charges for employee benefits are included in the relevant expenditure line by function.
Thenumber of employees at the year-end was 65,357 (2002: 69,659). Other employee benefits
consist mainly of life insurance schemes and certain other insurance schemes providing medical
and dental cover.
10. Pensions and other post-employment benefits in millions of CHF
Most employees are covered by retirement benefit plans sponsored by Group companies. The
nature of such plans varies according to legal regulations, fiscal requirements and economic con-
ditions of the countries in which the employees are employed. The majority of such plans are
defined benefit plans, the largest of which are located in Switzerland, the United States, Germany,
the United Kingdom and Japan. Other post-employment benefits consist mostly of post-retire-
ment healthcare and life insurance schemes, principally in the United States. Plans are usually
funded by payments from the Group and by employees to trusts independent of the Group’s
finances. Where a plan is unfunded, notably for the major defined benefit plans in Germany, a
liability for the whole obligation is recorded in the Group’s balance sheet.
The amounts recognised in arriving at operating profit for post-employment defined benefit plans
are as follows:
2003 2002
Current service cost 351 314
Interest cost 584 627
Expected return on plan assets (602) (688)
Net actuarial (gains) losses recognised 109 22
Past service cost 4 4
(Gains) losses on curtailment 23 –
Total included in employees’ remuneration 469 279
The actual return on plan assets was 1,050 million Swiss francs (2002: negative return of
1,022million Swiss francs).
In September 2002 the Group paid an additional contribution of 340 million US dollars (530 mil-
lion Swiss francs) into a post-employment defined benefit plan of one of its US subsidiaries, due
to falls in the market value of this plan’s assets during 2002. This payment is included in ‘contri-
butions paid’ in the table below and is accounted for as part of the recognised surplus on funded
pension plans (see also Note 22) in the Group’s consolidated financial statements in 2002.
Thereafter it has been included in the actuarial calculation of the Group’s pension expenses
andbalances.

dominantly non-current and are reported as long-term assets and non-current liabilities.
Plan assets of the funded plans do not include any of the Group’s own equity instruments
(2002:900,000 non-voting equity securities with a fair value of 87 million Swiss francs).
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements 103The Group operates defined benefit schemes in many countries and the actuarial assumptions
vary based upon local economic and social conditions. The range of assumptions used in the
actuarial valuations of the most significant defined benefit plans, which are in countries with
stable currencies and interest rates, is as follows:
2003 2002

11. Employee stock options and other equity compensation benefits in millions of CHF
Roche Option Plan
The Group offers non-voting equity security options to certain directors and management. The
exercise price is the market price of the non-voting equity securities at the date of issue. The
options, which are non-tradable, have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over
three years. The Group covers such obligations by purchasing non-voting equity securities, or
derivatives thereon (see Note 33). The cost of these instruments is reported in own equity instru-
ments, within equity on the balance sheet. When the options are exercised the cash received is
credited to own equity instruments. There are no impacts on the income statement, other than
employer social insurance costs and the administrative costs of the plan. The previous option
compensation plan, whereby the Group purchased options directly from third party financial insti-
tutions and granted them to certain employees, is closed; existing option grants under the old
plan continue, but no further such options are being granted. Details of the Roche Option Plan
are shown in the table below.

Roche Performance Share Plan
The Group offers future non-voting equity security awards (or at the Board’s discretion, their cash
equivalent) to certain directors and key senior management. The programme was established at
the beginning of 2002 and will be in effect for three years. The amount of non-voting equity
securities granted depends upon the individual’s salary level and the achievement of performance
targets linked to the Group’s total shareholders’ return (shares and non-voting equity securities
combined) relative to the Group’s peers during the three-year period from the date of the grant.
The grants vest after three years. The final number of non-voting equity securities awarded are
equivalent to between 0% and 200% of the original grant, depending on the final total share-
holders’ return performance. This will be approved by the Board of Directors after the close of the
2004 financial year and will be settled in 2005. The number of original grants outstanding as at
31December 2003 is 200,013. The cost of the plan is accrued over the vesting period of the grant,
based on the final cash outflow estimated at each balance sheet date. During the year the cost
ofthe plan was 18 million Swiss francs (2002: 15 million Swiss francs), which was reported within
the relevant operating expense categories.
Roche Connect
This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the United States and cer-
tain other countries, to make regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting equity
securities. It is administered by independent third parties. The Group makes a contribution to the
programme, which allows the employees to purchase non-voting equity securities at a discount
(usually 20%). The administrator purchases the necessary non-voting equity securities directly
from the market. 279,143 non-voting equity securities were held at 31 December 2003 (2002:
28,843). The programme has been operational since 1 October 2002. During the year the cost of
the plan was 6 million Swiss francs (2002: 1 million Swiss francs), which was reported within the
relevant operating expense categories.
Stock Appreciation Rights
Some employees of certain US subsidiaries of the Group receive Stock Appreciation Rights
(SARs) as part of their compensation. The SARs may be exercised after a vesting period of
between one and three years for a cash payment, based upon the amount that the market price
ofthe Group’s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) at the point of exercise exceeds the strike
price (grant price at issuance).

As part of the on-going alignment of its product portfolio, the Group periodically disposes of product
lines that are no longer considered as core products. On 30 September 2003 the Group announced
the sale to Protein Design Labs (PDL) of the business related to the Zenapax product worldwide in
all disease indications other than organ transplantation. The Group will continue to market Zenapax
in transplantation indications until 2007, at which point PDL have an option to purchase. The cash
received was 106 million Swiss francs. On 1 October 2002 the Group completed the sale to Amgen of
the business related to the Neupogen products in the European Union, Switzerland and Norway.
Thecash received was 217 million Swiss francs. For both of these disposals the products concerned
had no book value and so the gain on disposal was the same as the cash proceeds. Both of these
disposals are reported within the operating profit of the ‘Roche prescription’ segment.

Gains on LabCorp transactions
In March and July 2002 the Group sold its remaining shares of LabCorp. These transactions
resulted in a pre-tax gain after incidental costs of 1,032 million Swiss francs. These amounts were
recorded as part of financial income. The net pre-tax cash inflow was 1,246 million Swiss francs.
In addition, the Group realised a gain of 167 million Swiss francs on equity derivatives that were
entered into in connection with the disposal of LabCorp shares. The Group has no remaining
ownership interest in LabCorp and no outstanding derivative positions in LabCorp equities.
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements 107Impairment of financial assets
As at 31 December 2002 the Group revised its accounting estimates for impairment of financial
assets. In addition to the existing impairment triggers (as described in Note 1), any available-
for-sale financial assets that have a market value of more than 25% below their original cost, net
of any previous impairment, for a sustained six month period will be considered as impaired. Any
falls in the market price of less than 25% of original cost, net of any previous impairment, or for
less than a sustained six-month period are not by themselves considered as objective evidence
ofimpairment, and such movements in fair value are recorded in equity until there is objective
evidence of impairment or until the asset is sold or otherwise disposed of. As a result of this revision
in accounting estimate, the Group recorded an exceptional impairment charge of 5,192 million
Swiss francs effective 31 December 2002.
Write-downs and impairments of equity securities in 2003 of 313 million Swiss francs mostly arise
from available-for-sale financial assets that have a market value of more than 25% below their
original cost for a sustained six-month period that are considered as impaired. These mainly
relate to equity securities that as at 31 December 2002 had a market value below the above limit
but for less than a sustained six-month period.
15. Income taxes in millions of CHF

Since the Group operates across the world, it is subject to income taxes in many different tax
jurisdictions. The Group calculates its average expected tax rate as a weighted average of the tax
rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates. This rate increased during 2002 as
operating income became a considerably higher proportion of pre-tax income than has been the
case in previous years. This caused an increase in the Group’s effective tax rate, as operating
income typically occurs in jurisdictions with higher tax rates when compared to financial income.
In 2003 the Group’s average expected tax rate has stabilised. Within the Group’s average
expected tax rate, the increasing significance of Genentech and Chugai causes an increase in the
rate which has been offset by ongoing improvement of the Group’s structures.
The Group’s effective tax rate can be reconciled to the Group’s average expected tax rate as
follows:

Deferred income tax liabilities (3,133) (3,551)
Net deferred income tax asset (liability) in the balance sheet (2,233) (2,767)
The decrease in current income tax assets is due to reimbursement in 2003 of Swiss withholding
taxes and a tax receivable in the United States. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax
loss carry forwards only to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit is probable. The
Group has unrecognised tax losses, including valuation allowances, of 594 million Swiss francs
(2002: 584 million Swiss francs), of which 111 million Swiss francs expires within five years. The
remaining 483 million Swiss francs of losses expire after fifteen years or more, or have no expiry
limit. Deferred income tax liabilities have not been established for the withholding tax and other
taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, as such
amounts are currently regarded as permanently reinvested. These unremitted earnings totalled
22.8 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2003 (2002: 21.3 billion Swiss francs).
The deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the deferred income tax charges (credits) are

Group currently has no internally generated intangible assets from development as the criteria
forthe recognition as an asset are not met.

Environmental and legal provisions
These provisions include 208 million Swiss francs (2002: 179 million Swiss francs) for environmen-
tal matters and 1,104 million Swiss francs (2002: 1,931 million Swiss francs) for litigation, includ-
ing major legal cases and the vitamin case.
Provisions for environmental matters cover various separate environmental issues in a number
ofcountries. Approximately half of these were pre-existing in companies acquired by the Group.
The Group has recorded additional environmental provisions in respect of certain indemnities
given to DSM in respect of any remedial actions at the sites of the VFC business (see Note 7).
Bytheir nature the amounts and timing of any outflows are difficult to predict. The Group
estimates that approximately half of the amount provided for may result in cash outflows over
thenext five years. Significant provisions are discounted by between 4% and 7%.
116 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsLegal provisions consist mainly of the major legal cases, notably the City of Hope Medical Center
litigation (see Note 8) and the vitamin case (see Note 7). The amounts, timing and uncertainties
of any outflows are discussed in those notes, as are the discount rates used. The remaining legal
provisions, which account for less than 20% of the balance, consist of a number of other separate
legal matters in various Group companies. The majority of any cash outflows are expected to
occur within the next one to three years, although these are dependent on the development of
thevarious litigations. Significant provisions are discounted by between 4% and 7%.
Major legal cases are described in Note 8 and the vitamin case is described in Note 7.
Other litigation matters, which are currently not as significant, are described below.
Carvedilol arbitration: Roche Diagnostics GmbH (‘RDG’) and SmithKline Beecham (Cork) Ltd
(‘SB’) are party to arbitration concerning RDG’s termination in 1998 of the Carvedilol License
Agreement of 1987, as amended in 1995, relating to the licensing and co-marketing of carvedilol.
RDG has submitted a claim for damages to an Arbitration Tribunal in Zurich and SB has sub-
mitted a counter-claim asserting the invalidity of RDG’s termination and claiming damages. The
final decision of the Arbitration Tribunal is expected at the earliest in 2005. The amount of pro-
visions, if any, recorded by RDG is not disclosed as this may seriously prejudice RDG’s position
inthis matter.
Applera litigation: On 9 October 2003 Applera Corporation (‘Applera’) filed suit against the
Group in the Superior Court of California and filed a Notice of Arbitration with the American Arbi-
tration Association. Both the Superior Court lawsuit and the arbitration demand make claims con-
cerning the interpretation and enforcement of contracts between the Group and Applera for the
commercialisation of the polymerase chain reaction (‘PCR’) technology. The claims seek termina-
tion of certain contracts, declarations regarding rights and obligations under those contracts, and
monetary damages and other relief in an unspecified amount for alleged breaches of various
agreements between the parties. On 15 December 2003, the Group filed its response in the arbi-
tration proceeding, in which the Group generally denied the claims against it and has made
counter-claims against Applera for declarations concerning the respective rights and obligations
of the parties under those contracts, including an alleged breach of Applera’s obligation to
source certain enzymes from the Group, and for damages. On 15 December 2003, the Group also
responded to Applera’s complaint in the Superior Court proceeding by petitioning the Court to
compel arbitration of the claims alleged by Applera and to stay the lawsuit pending completion of
the arbitration. The Court has not yet ruled on the Group’s petition. No hearing or trial date has
yet been set in either the arbitration proceeding or the Superior Court lawsuit. No provisions have
been recorded in respect of these matters, as the outcome cannot be determined as of the date
of these financial statements.
Promega litigation: In 1992 the Group filed a suit against the Promega Corporation (‘Promega’)
alleging patent infringement and breach of a licence agreement relating to the polymerase chain
reaction (‘PCR’) technology. This litigation is currently with the US District Court of the Northern
District of California with a decision on the enforceability of one of the patents concerned
expected in 2004. On 12 November 2003 the Group was notified that Promega had filed a non
public (Qui Tam) action against the Group with the US District Court of the Eastern District of
West Virginia in March 2000. This complaint, filed under the False Claims Act, alleges that the US
Federal Government was overcharged in its purchase of PCR enzyme products. In July 2003 the
US Federal Government notified the Court of its decision not to intervene in Promega’s complaint
and on 12 November 2003 the Court ordered the complaint of 2000 to be unsealed. The Group
intends to file a motion to dismiss this complaint. No provisions have been recorded in respect of
this litigation.
Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements 117Restructuring provisions
These arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of business undertaken
by the Group or the manner in which business is conducted. Such provisions include only the
costs necessarily entailed by the restructuring which are not associated with the on-going activi-
ties of the Group. Expected outflows in 2004 include the remaining 28 million Swiss francs relat-
ing to the restructuring of Disetronic and 231 million Swiss francs relating to closure costs that
are part of the Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring announced in 2001. The remaining
amounts are mostly in respect of obligations towards former employees arising from the Pharma-
ceuticals Division restructuring and other previous restructuring plans. The timings of these cash
outflows are reasonably certain on a global basis and are shown in the above table. Significant
provisions are discounted by 4%.
Other provisions
Other provisions consist mostly of claims arising from trade and various other provisions from
Group companies that do not fit into the above categories. The timings of cash outflows are
bytheir nature uncertain and the best estimates are shown in the above table. These provisions
are not discounted as the time value of money is not considered material in this case.
Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees,
tobe affected by political, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating
to environmental protection, in the countries in which it operates. The industries in which the
Group is engaged are also subject to physical risks of various kinds. The nature and frequency
ofthese developments and events, not all of which are covered by insurance, as well as their
effect on future operations and earnings are not predictable. See also Note 7 in respect of the
vitamin case and Note 8 in respect of major legal cases.
The Group has entered into strategic alliances with various companies in order to gain access
topotential new products or to utilise other companies to help develop the Group’s own potential
new products. Potential future payments may become due to certain collaboration partners
achieving certain milestones as defined in the collaboration agreements. The Group’s best esti-
mate of future commitments for such payments is 119 million Swiss francs in 2004, 171 million
Swiss francs in 2005 and 133 million Swiss francs in 2006.

The ‘LYONs’ zero coupon US dollar exchangeable notes (see below) are reflected as due the first
year that the holders of the notes can request the Group to purchase the notes.
The fair value of the debt instruments is 11.6 billion Swiss francs (2002: 12.6 billion Swiss francs)
and the fair value of total debt is 16.3 billion Swiss francs (2002: 23.3 billion Swiss francs). This
iscalculated based upon the present value of the future cash flows on the instrument, discounted
at a market rate of interest for instruments with similar credit status, cash flows and maturity
periods.
There are no pledges on the Group’s assets in connection with debt, except as noted below.
Theobligation arising from leases at Genentech is supported by restricted cash of 57 million
USdollars (70 million Swiss francs). In addition, this obligation is secured on property, plant and
equipment which has a net book value of 723 million Swiss francs as at 31 December 2003.
Amounts due to banks and other financial institutions
Interest rates on these amounts, which are primarily denominated in US dollars and euros,
average approximately 3.4% (2002: 2.8%). Repayment dates vary between 1 and 24 years.
1,571million Swiss francs (2002: 4,631 million Swiss francs) are due within one year.

Conversion of ‘Helveticus’ Swiss franc convertible bonds: By the due date of 31 July 2003
all of the remaining Swiss franc convertible bonds originally issued in 1995 were converted into
non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine).A total of 2,167,600 non-voting equity securities
were used to meet the conversion obligations of the ‘Helveticus’ bonds in 2003. In accordance
with the terms of the bonds, an additional cash payment of CHF 200 per bond was made upon the
conversion of the remaining principal. The conversion reduced debt by 207 million Swiss francs,
of which 202 million Swiss francs was in the form of non-voting equity securities and 5million
Swiss francs in the form of cash.

11November 2004 at par plus 3% accrued annual interest. Each share is exchangeable at the
option of the holder for 14.29 non-voting equity securities or redeemable at the option of the

Hedge accounting
The Group’s accounting policy on hedge accounting, which is described in Note 1, requires that
to qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions
ondocumentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
As described in Note 2, the Group has financial risk management policies, which cover foreign
exchange risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. When deemed appropri-
ate, certain of the above risks are altered through the use of derivatives. While many of these
transactions can be considered as hedges in economic terms, if the required conditions are not
met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instru-
ment and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship,
which means that any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in
financial income.
The Group generally limits the use of hedge accounting to certain significant transactions. Conse-
quently as at 31 December 2003 the Group has no fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges
of net investment in a foreign entity that meet the strict requirements to qualify for hedge
accounting, apart from those described below for the Igen acquisition and for the Group’s sub-
sidiary Genentech.
In connection with the proposed acquisition of Igen, the Group would contribute 214 million US
dollars to Igen and purchase Igen’s shares for 1,226 million US dollars, giving a total cash outflow
of 1,440 million US dollars. During 2003, the Group has contributed 540 million US dollars as
equity to an acquisition vehicle. The remaining 900 million US dollars will be funded from liquid
funds held in Swiss francs and euros. The Group has entered into forward contracts to buy
200million US dollars for Swiss francs and 700 million US dollars for euros in order to hedge the
foreign exchange risk that could arise from movements in the US dollar exchange rate. The for-
ward rates are between 1.2488–1.2593 CHF/USD and 0.8108–0.8297 EUR/USD and the value
dateis 4 February 2004. The fair values of the forward contracts at 31 December 2003 were nega-
tive 4 million Swiss francs and negative 32 million Swiss francs respectively.
Genentech has non-US dollar cash flows from future royalty income and development expenses
expected over the next one to five years. To hedge part of this transaction exposure Genentech
enters into derivative financial instruments such as options and forward contracts. There were no
such instruments outstanding as at 31 December 2003. Genentech has equity investments in
various biotechnology companies that are subject to a greater risk of market fluctuation than the
stock market in general. To manage part of this exposure Genentech enters into derivative finan-
cial instruments such as zero cost collars and forward contracts. As at 31 December 2003 such
instruments, which are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, are recorded in the balance
sheet with a fair value of 151 million Swiss francs. These matters are also described in Genen-
tech’s annual report and quarterly SEC filings.
Movements on the fair value reserve for designated cash flow hedges are included in Note 35.

Non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
As of 31 December 2003, 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities were in issue as in the preced-
ing year. Under Swiss company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value, are
not part of the share capital and cannot be issued against a contribution which would be shown
as an asset in the balance sheet of Roche Holding Ltd. Each non-voting equity security confers
the same rights as any of the shares to participate in the net profit and any remaining proceeds
from liquidation following repayment of the nominal value of the shares and, if any, participation
certificates. In accordance with the law and the Articles of Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd,
the company is entitled at all times to exchange all or some of the non-voting equity securities
into shares or participation certificates.
Dividends
On 1 April 2003 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of 1.45 Swiss francs per
share and non-voting equity security (2002 1.30 Swiss francs) in respect of the 2002 business
year. The distribution to holders of outstanding shares and non-voting equity securities totalled
1,229 million Swiss francs (2002: 1,101 million Swiss francs) and has been recorded against
retained earnings in 2003. The Board has proposed dividends for the 2003 business year of
1.65Swiss francs per share and non-voting equity security. This is subject to approval at the
Annual General Meeting on 6 April 2004.
Own equity instruments
Following the redemption of the ‘LYONs II’ exchangeable notes on 20 April 2003 (see Note 31)
and in light of the on-going restructuring of the Group’s treasury operations and debt financing,
the Group has carried out a comprehensive review of the arrangements whereby it covers the
potential conversion obligations that may arise from its convertible debt instruments. The Group
has refinanced the various instruments that cover its potential obligations to deliver non-voting
equity securities. The Group has sold 11,671,933 of those non-voting equity securities that it pre-
viously held in a series of transactions, in addition to the 2,744,893 non-voting equity securities
utilised for the Disetronic transaction (see Note 3) and the 2,167,600 utilised for the conversion of
the ‘Helveticus’ bonds (see Note 31). The Group has also agreed with its counter-parties to
restructure its previous arrangements which used written/short put options and purchased/long
call options at the same strike price, which had the combined effect of a forward purchase. By
31December 2003 all of these arrangements have been closed. In addition the Group has pur-
chased from various counter-parties Low Exercise Price Options (LEPOs), which give the Group
the right to purchase non-voting equity securities at a low strike price.

ber of non-voting equity securities:

Non-voting equity securities and Low Exercise Price Options are held for the potential conversion
obligations that may arise from the Group’s convertible debt instruments (see Note 31). The
Group’s potential obligations to employees for the Roche Option Plan (see Note 11) are covered
by call options that are exercisable at any time up to their maturity. The Group also holds a resid-
ual number of options that were purchased for use in the Group’s previous option compensation
scheme, which is now closed (see Note 11).
At 31 December 2003 there were no amounts recorded in debt for forward contracts to purchase
non-voting equity securities (31 December 2002: 2,413 million Swiss francs) and no amounts
recorded in financial long-term assets for collateral to cover the forward purchases (31December
2002: 673 million Swiss francs). The net cash outflow for transactions in own equity instruments
regarding the refinancing of instruments covering convertible debt obligations was 1,635 million
Swiss francs. The net cash outflow from other transactions in own equity instruments was 15 mil-
lion Swiss francs (2002: netcash inflow of 20million Swiss francs).
The Group holds none of its own shares.

Diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security, the net income
and weighted average number of shares and non-voting equity securities outstanding are
adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential shares and non-voting equity securities.
Potential dilutive effects arise from the convertible debt instruments and the employee stock
option plans. If the outstanding convertible debt instruments were to be converted this would
lead to a reduction in interest expense and an increase in the number of shares which may
havea net dilutive effect on the earnings per share. The exercise of outstanding vested employee
stock options would have a dilutive effect. The exercise of the outstanding vested Genentech
employee stock options would have a dilutive effect if the net income of Genentech is positive.
The diluted earnings per share and non-voting equity security shows the potential impacts
ofthese dilutive effects on the earnings per share figures.

Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities are those derived from the Group’s primary activities, as
described in the divisional review. This is calculated by the indirect method, adjusting the Group’s
operating profit for any operating income and expenses that are not cash flows (for example
depreciation, amortisation and impairment) in order to derive the cash generated from operations.
This and other operating cash flows are shown in the cash flow statement. Operating cash flows
also include income taxes paid on all activities, including, for example, the taxes paid on the
gains from LabCorp share sales.

on these instruments. Cash flows from short-term financing, including finance leases, are also
included. These cash flows indicate the Group’s transactions with the providers of its equity and
debt financing. Cash flows from short-term borrowings are shown as a net movement, as these
consist of a large number of transactions with short maturity.

anddividend payments received in respect of these securities and investments. These cash flows
indicate the Group’s net reinvestment in its operating assets and the cash flow effects of the
changes in Group organisation, as well as the cash generated by the Group’s other investments.
Cash flows from marketable securities, including income and capital gains and losses, are shown
as a net movement on the Group’s portfolio, as these consist of a large number of positions which
are not held on a long-term basis. The cash flows from LabCorp transactions (see Note 14) are
shown as a separate line in the cash flow statement. The cash flows in respect of Chugai consist
of cash payments by Roche to third parties less the cash held by Chugai when acquired.

134 Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsReport of the Group Auditors
To the General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
As auditors of the Group, we have audited the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
(consolidated income statement, consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of changes
in equity, consolidated cash flow statement and consolidated notes) on pages 70 to 134 for the
year ended 31 December 2003.
These Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the Board of Directors of Roche
Holding Ltd. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Consolidated Financial State-
ments based on our audit. We confirm that we meet the Swiss legal requirements concerning
professional qualification and independence.
Our audit was conducted in accordance with auditing standards promulgated by the Swiss pro-
fession and with the International Standards on Auditing, which require that an audit be planned
and performed to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial State-
ments are free from material misstatement. We have examined on a test basis evidence support-
ing the amounts and disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We have also
assessed the accounting principles used, significant estimates made and the overall consolidated
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Roche Group present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position as of 31 December 2003, and the results of operations
and the cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS), and comply with Swiss law.
We recommend that the Consolidated Financial Statements submitted to you be approved.

CER (Constant Exchange Rates): The percentage changes at constant exchange rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the 2017 and 2016 results at constant
exchange rates (the average rates for the year ended 31 December 2016). For the definition of CER see page 148.
Core results and Core EPS (earnings per share): These exclude non-core items such as global restructuring plans and amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.
This allows an assessment of both the actual results and the underlying performance of the business. A full income statement for the Group and the operating results of the divisions
are shown on both an IFRS and core basis. The core concept is fully described on pages 141–144 and reconciliations between the IFRS and core results are given there.
Free cash flow is used to assess the Group’s ability to generate the cash required to conduct and maintain its operations. It also indicates the Group’s ability to generate cash
to finance dividend payments, repay debt and to undertake merger and acquisition activities. The free cash flow concept is used in the internal management of the business.

Roche in 2017
The Roche Group reported good overall results in 2017. Sales and core earnings per share both grew by 5% at constant exchange rates (CER).
IFRS net income decreased by 9% due to significant impairments of goodwill and intangible assets.
Sales
Group sales increased by 5% (CER) to CHF 53.3 billion (5% growth in CHF terms).
Pharmaceuticals sales growth was 5% (CER) due to recently launched medicines Ocrevus, Tecentriq and Alecensa. In oncology there was
continued growth in the HER2 franchise, while sales of Avastin decreased due to competitive pressure. Immunology sales increased, led by Xolair
and Actemra/RoActemra. Sales of Tamiflu fell due to generic competition in the US. The entry of biosimilars had a negative impact on sales of
MabThera/Rituxan in Europe.
Diagnostics sales showed growth of 5% (CER) with the immunodiagnostics business being the major contributor.
Operating results
Core operating profit increased by 3% (CER) to CHF 19.0 billion (3% increase in CHF terms).
Research and development expenditure grew by 5% (CER) to CHF 10.4 billion on a core basis, with the focus on the oncology and
immunology therapeutic areas. Research and development costs represented 19.5% of Group sales.
IFRS operating results include non-core expenses (pre-tax) of CHF 6.0 billion. The major factors were CHF 3.5 billion for the impairment
of goodwill and intangible assets, CHF 1.7 billion for the amortisation of intangible assets and CHF 1.2 billion from global restructuring plans,
notably the Pharmaceuticals Division’s strategic realignment of its manufacturing network.
Non-operating results
Financing costs (IFRS) decreased by CHF 0.3 billion to CHF 0.8 billion, driven by lower interest expenses and lower losses on bond
redemptions.
Income tax expenses (IFRS) include transitional expenses of CHF 0.1 billion arising from changes to US tax rates. The core effective tax rate
was 26.6%.
Net income
IFRS net income decreased by 9% at CER to CHF 8.8 billion (9% decrease in CHF terms).
Core earnings per share increased by 5% at CER (+6% in CHF terms).
Cash flows
Operating free cash flow increased significantly to CHF 17.8 billion. The underlying cash generation in both divisions, lower net working capital
and lower capital expenditure led to an increase of operating free cash flow of 26% at CER (27% in CHF terms).
Free cash flow increased by 47% at CER (47% in CHF terms) to CHF 13.4 billion, driven by the higher operating free cash flow as well as lower
pension contributions and lower interest paid.
Financial position
Net working capital decreased by 19% (CER), due to higher payables and accrued liabilities and lower inventories offset by an increase
in receivables driven by increased sales.
Net debt decreased to CHF 7.0 billion, as the generated free cash flow more than offset the dividends paid. Net debt as a percentage
of total assets was 9%.
Credit ratings strong: Moody’s at A1 and Standard & Poor’s at AA.
Shareholder return
Dividends. A proposal will be made to increase dividends by 1% to CHF 8.30 per share. This will represent the 31st consecutive year of dividend
growth and will result in a pay-out ratio of 54.1%, subject to AGM approval.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) was 9% representing the combined performance of share and non-voting equity security.Roche Group

The Roche Group’s results for 2017 showed sales growth of 5% at constant exchange rates (CER), with core operating profit up by
3% and Core EPS up by 5%. The sales growth was driven by the recently launched Pharmaceuticals products Ocrevus, Tecentriq and
Alecensa, and by the immunodiagnostics business in the Diagnostics Division. The Group continued supporting the development and
launch of new products, and reported growth in core operating profit despite the base effect of income from pension changes in the
2016 results. Operating free cash flow was CHF 17.8 billion, an increase of 26%, due to the cash generated from the business coupled
with a decrease in net working capital and lower capital expenditure.
Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division rose by 5% to CHF 41.2 billion with Ocrevus, Tecentriq and Alecensa contributing CHF 1.4 billion of
new sales, representing 65% of the division’s growth. In oncology, HER2 franchise sales increased by 7% to CHF 10.1 billion, led by Perjeta.
MabThera/Rituxan sales were CHF 7.4 billion, a growth of 1% globally, despite sales in Europe being 11% lower following biosimilar entry.
Sales of Avastin were CHF 6.7 billion, a decline of 2% due to competitive pressure. Sales in immunology grew to CHF 7.6 billion, with
Xolair and Actemra/RoActemra increasing by 16% and 14% respectively. Sales of Tamiflu fell by 33% due to competition from generics
in the US market. Diagnostics Division sales grew by 5%, with the major growth area being Centralised and Point of Care Solutions
where sales increased by 7% led by its immunodiagnostics business.
IFRS operating profit was stable in the Pharmaceuticals Division and down by 74% in the Diagnostics Division, with both divisions
impacted by impairment charges to goodwill and intangible assets. In Pharmaceuticals core operating profit increased by 4%, while in
Diagnostics it remained stable, with the operating profit growth rates of both divisions being impacted by the base effect of income
in 2016 from changes to the Group’s Swiss pension plans. For Pharmaceuticals, marketing and distribution costs grew by 6% due to the
launch of new products, notably Ocrevus and Tecentriq. There was continued investment in research and development, which totalled
over CHF 10 billion for the Group. The major areas in Pharmaceuticals were oncology, with Tecentriq and the cancer immunotherapy
portfolio being key drivers, immunology and neuroscience. Diagnostics activities increasingly focused on integrated core laboratory
and digitalised data management projects and during 2017 the division acquired Viewics, a software company focused on laboratory
business analytics.
Operating free cash flow was CHF 17.8 billion, an increase of CHF 3.7 billion or 26%. This was due to the high cash generation of the
business, with sales growth exceeding the increases in cash expenses. Furthermore net working capital decreased overall in 2017 after
an increase in 2016. The decrease was mainly due to higher payables partially offset by higher receivables. Capital expenditure decreased
as well compared to 2016. The free cash flow was CHF 13.4 billion, an increase of CHF 4.3 billion, due to the higher operating free cash
flow, lower pension contributions and lower interest payments.
Net income decreased by 9% at CER on an IFRS basis while it increased by 6% on a core basis. In addition to the items described above
in the core results, the IFRS results include intangible asset impairment charges totalling CHF 3.5 billion, notably CHF 1.7 billion for
the partial impairment of the Esbriet product intangible asset and impairments for the Diagnostics sequencing business of CHF 0.8 billion.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 3Roche Group | Financial Review
Global restructuring expenses were CHF 1.2 billion, in line with 2016 expenses. There was offsetting income of CHF 0.4 billion from
the reversal of contingent consideration arrangements and CHF 0.2 billion of income from the release of legal provisions. Financing costs
were lower due to decreasing interest expenses and lower losses on bond redemptions. The changes to US tax rates that will become
effective from 1 January 2018 resulted in a transitional expense of CHF 0.1 billion in 2017 arising from the remeasurement of the Group’s
year-end deferred tax positions. Core EPS increased by 5% at CER, in line with the sales growth of 5%.
In 2017 compared to 2016, the Swiss franc was weaker against the euro and other European currencies and against several major
currencies in the Asia-Pacific region. This was partially offset by the stronger Swiss franc against the Japanese yen. The Swiss franc
remained stable against the US dollar. The net impact is negligible on the results expressed in Swiss francs compared to constant
exchange rates for sales, core operating profit and Core EPS.

Sales
In 2017 sales increased by 5% at CER (+5% in CHF; +5% in USD) to CHF 53.3 billion. Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division rose 5% to
CHF 41.2 billion, with growth in the oncology, immunology and neuroscience therapeutic areas. A key growth driver was the additional
CHF 1.4 billion of sales for the recently launched products Ocrevus, Tecentriq and Alecensa. These three new products represented 65%
of the division’s growth and already account for 4% of the division’s total sales. MabThera/Rituxan sales were CHF 7.4 billion, a growth
of 1% driven by the US growth of 6%. The first biosimilar versions were launched in several EU markets in 2017 and contributed to a
decrease of MabThera/Rituxan sales in Europe by 11%. Sales of Avastin were CHF 6.7 billion, a decline of 2% due to competitive pressure.
The HER2 franchise continued to grow, with sales increasing by 7%. The main drivers of this growth were increased global demand
for Perjeta and higher Herceptin sales, notably in the US. Immunology sales were CHF 7.6 billion, a growth of 9% coming from Actemra/
RoActemra (+14%) and Xolair (+16%). Sales of Tamiflu fell by 33% due to competition from generics in the US market. The Diagnostics
Division recorded sales of CHF 12.1 billion, an increase of 5%. The major growth area was Centralised and Point of Care Solutions, which
represents 60% of the division’s sales and which grew by 7%, led by the immunodiagnostics business.

Core operating results
Core operating profit for the Group increased by 3% at CER. For the Pharmaceuticals Division core operating profit increased by 4%,
while in the Diagnostics Division it was stable at CHF 1.9 billion. In 2016 there was income of CHF 426 million (pre-tax) from changes
to the Group’s pension plans in Switzerland. Excluding this item, core operating profit for the Group grew by 6% compared to 2016,
with growth of 6% for the Pharmaceuticals Division and 4% for the Diagnostics Division.
Pharmaceuticals Division. The division’s core operating profit increased by 4% at CER, which was below the 5% sales increase.
There was increased expenditure on research and development, as well as launch expenses for Ocrevus and Tecentriq and other
new products. Income from product disposals and other income was CHF 611 million in 2017 compared to CHF 325 million in 2016.
The income from the pension plan changes in 2016 was CHF 310 million.
Diagnostics Division. Core operating profit was stable in CER, with an increase of 4% when the 2016 pension changes are excluded.
Cost of sales increased due to an unfavourable product mix arising from higher instrument placements, notably in the Asia-Pacific
region. Marketing and distribution increased, with higher spending in emerging markets, especially in China. General and administration
increased due to the income from pension changes in 2016, with a base effect in 2016 of CHF 77 million.
Acquisitions
In 2017 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in mySugr GmbH, which has developed one of the leading mobile diabetes
platforms in the market. The total cash consideration was CHF 70 million. In addition the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest
in Viewics, Inc. for a consideration of CHF 80 million. Viewics is a software company focused on laboratory business analytics.
On 22 December 2017 the Group announced an agreement to fully acquire Ignyta, Inc. with a total transaction value of USD 1.7 billion.
In 2017 there was CHF 353 million of non-core income from contingent consideration provisions, mainly due to the reversal of the
remaining provision related to the Seragon acquisition and the partial reversal of the provisions related to the Dutalys and Trophos
acquisitions. There were impairment charges of CHF 653 million related to these acquisitions, as noted below in the ‘Impairment
of goodwill and intangible assets’ commentary. In 2016 there was CHF 408 million of non-core income from contingent consideration
provisions and related intangible asset impairment charges of CHF 1,072 million. Non-core costs in 2016 also included expenses of
CHF 167 million from the release of the Esbriet inventory fair value adjustment, which was fully unwound by mid-2016.
Further details are given in Notes 5 and 29 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Global restructuring plans
During 2017 the Group initiated various resourcing flexibility plans in its Pharmaceuticals Division to address various future challenges
including biosimilar competition. The areas of the plans include biologics manufacturing, commercial operations and product development/
strategy. The Group also continued with the implementation of several major global restructuring plans initiated in prior years, notably
the strategic realignment of the Pharmaceuticals Division’s manufacturing network, and programmes to address long-term strategy in
the Diagnostics Division.

2) Includes the Pharmaceuticals Division’s strategic realignment of its manufacturing network and resourcing flexibility in biologics manufacturing network.
3) Includes plans for resourcing flexibility in the Pharmaceuticals Division’s commercial operations and global product development/strategy organisations.
Diagnostics Division. Strategy plans in the Diagnostics Division that were launched in 2016 incurred costs of CHF 212 million mainly
for employee-related costs. Spending on other smaller plans within the division was CHF 80 million and included costs related to
the ‘Autonomy and Speed’ initiative in Diabetes Care and certain IT projects.
Site consolidation. On 12 November 2015 the Pharmaceuticals Division announced a strategic realignment of its manufacturing network
including exiting from the manufacturing sites at Clarecastle, Ireland; Leganés, Spain; Segrate, Italy; and Florence, US. Costs from
this plan in 2017 were CHF 480 million, of which CHF 185 million were non-cash write-downs and accelerated depreciation of property,
plant and equipment. Some employee-related provisions were reversed as the most likely scenario for the Segrate site was changed
from closure to divestment. The divestments of the Florence, Segrate and Leganés sites have been completed and result in total costs
of CHF 201 million. This includes CHF 100 million of accumulated currency translation losses on consolidation that were transferred to
the income statement. The expected costs of the environmental remediation at the Clarecastle site were reassessed and resulted in an
increase in provisions for environmental remediation. Other plans include the resourcing flexibility in biologics manufacturing network
which resulted in headcount reductions in the US and also at the Kaiseraugst site in Switzerland and the exit from the small molecules
manufacturing site at Toluca, Mexico.
Other global restructuring plans. The major item was CHF 247 million for resourcing flexibility in the Pharmaceuticals Division, including
global field force reductions, notably in the US and Europe. The remaining CHF 85 million includes plans for the outsourcing of IT and
other functions to shared service centres and external providers.
Further details are given in Note 6 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
There were impairment charges of CHF 2,572 million in the Pharmaceuticals Division. The largest item was a charge of CHF 1,664 million
for the partial impairment of the Esbriet product intangible acquired as part of the InterMune acquisition. An impairment charge was
recorded in the first half of 2017 for this intangible asset following lower-than-expected sales of Esbriet in the first half of 2017 relative
to the most recent long-term forecasts. The revised long-term forecasts prepared in the second half of 2017 show a further reduction
in sales expectations which resulted in an additional impairment charge.
There was a charge of CHF 384 million for the full write-off of the goodwill relating to the Seragon acquisition due to the decision to
stop development of the back-up compound acquired. In addition, there was an impairment of CHF 195 million relating to a compound
acquired as part of the Trophos acquisition arising from the launch of a competitor product and an impairment of CHF 149 million due
to the decision to stop development of one compound with an alliance partner following assessment of clinical and non-clinical data.
There was a related decrease in the contingent consideration provisions, mainly from the Seragon, Trophos and Dutalys acquisitions,
which contributed to the income of CHF 353 million noted above in the ‘Acquisitions’ commentary.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 7Roche Group | Financial Review
The Diagnostics Division recorded impairment charges of CHF 946 million. The major part of this was in the sequencing business
with impairment charges of CHF 674 million against goodwill and CHF 120 million against product intangible assets acquired as part of
the Ariosa acquisition. These impairments are due to the latest long-term forecasts projecting a decrease in forecasted cash flows
due to changed assumptions around market penetration, pricing and reimbursement and a revised time to market of the single molecule
sequencing technology.
In addition, in the molecular diagnostics business, a partial impairment of CHF 152 million was also recorded against the product
intangible assets acquired as part of the GeneWeave acquisition. This was also due to a decrease in forecasted cash flows, and follows
a change in the timelines for future product development and updated market size assumptions.
Further details are given in Notes 8 and 9 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
During 2016 operating income of CHF 426 million was recorded for past service costs from changes to the Group’s pension plans in
Switzerland that were announced in June 2016. This represented the one-time impact of the adjustment of the pension liability for the plan
changes. Of this amount, CHF 310 million was recorded in the Pharmaceuticals Division, CHF 77 million in the Diagnostics Division
and CHF 39 million in Corporate. The after-tax impact was CHF 341 million. This matter has a base effect on the growth rates shown in
the 2017 results.
Further information on the Group’s pensions and other post-employment benefits is given in Note 25 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Legal and environmental cases
Based on the development of the various litigations, notably the Accutane case, some of the provisions previously held were released,
resulting in income of CHF 219 million in 2017. The expected costs of the environmental remediation at the Clarecastle site in Ireland
were reassessed and resulted in an increase in provisions for environmental remediation. There were no other significant developments
impacting the 2017 financial results. Further details are given in Note 19 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Treasury and taxation
Core financing costs were CHF 819 million, a decrease of 21%, due to lower interest expenses, lower interest costs of pension plans
and lower losses on bond redemption. Core other financial income was CHF 75 million, including net income from equity securities of
CHF 162 million, partly offset by net foreign exchange losses of CHF 115 million. Core tax expenses increased by 3% to CHF 4.9 billion and,
since this was lower than the increase in profit before tax, the Group’s effective core tax rate decreased to 26.6% compared to 27.2% in
2016. This was largely due to mix effects within the manufacturing supply chain.
On 22 December 2017 changes to US tax rates were enacted that will become effective from 1 January 2018. Among the changes is
a decrease in the US Federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. These resulted in a transitional expense of CHF 116 million in 2017 arising from
the remeasurement of the Group’s deferred tax positions which has been treated as a non-core item. Had these new rates applied for
the whole of 2017, and excluding any transition impacts, the Group’s 2017 effective core tax rate in percentage terms would have been
in the low twenties.

Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc depreciated significantly against the euro. This had a positive translation impact
on balance sheet positions. The appreciation of the Swiss franc against the US dollar had a negative translation impact on net operating
assets, which was mostly offset at Group level by the natural hedge from the Group’s US dollar-denominated debt. The exchange rates
used are given on page 28.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 9Roche Group | Financial Review
In the Pharmaceuticals Division net working capital decreased by 24% at CER. A major driver was higher liabilities for sales rebates and
chargebacks. Another factor was inventories, where write-offs and a decrease in inventory levels for certain mature products were partly
offset by higher inventories for launch products. This was offset by the increase in trade receivables due to higher sales and extended
post-launch payment terms for Ocrevus in the US. Long-term net operating assets were lower due to the CHF 2.6 billion of impairments
of intangible assets. In the Diagnostics Division the decrease in net working capital of 10% at CER was driven by an increase of other
payables due to higher liabilities for pending rebates. Inventories decreased due to inventories optimisation initiatives and high demand.
The decrease in trade payables followed the lower spending, while trade receivables increased due to higher sales. Long-term net
operating assets decreased by 4% due to lower goodwill and intangible assets, partially offset by higher property, plant and equipment
and lower provisions.
The decrease in net debt was due to free cash flow of CHF 13.4 billion, partly offset by dividend payments of CHF 7.1 billion. The net
pension liability decreased by CHF 0.3 billion to CHF 6.6 billion due to improved asset performance. The net tax liabilities decreased
mainly due to the deferred tax impact from the impairment of intangible assets, partially offset by the deferred tax impact from the
changes in US tax rates announced in late 2017.

For the definition of free cash flow and a detailed breakdown see pages 144–146.
The Group’s operating free cash flow for 2017 was CHF 17.8 billion, an increase of CHF 3.7 billion or 26% at CER. This reflects
the higher cash generation of the business due to improved operating results with sales growth exceeding cash operating expenses.
The development of the operating free cash flow was also positively impacted by net working capital, which decreased in 2017 after
an increase in 2016. The decrease was mainly due to higher payables partially offset by higher receivables. There is also a base impact
from inventories, where the build-up in 2016 was not repeated, and this contributed to the year-on-year growth in operating free cash
flow. Capital expenditure was also lower than in the comparative period. The free cash flow in 2017 was CHF 13.4 billion, an increase of
CHF 4.3 billion compared to 2016, due to the higher operating free cash flow, lower pension contributions and lower interest payments.

Pharmaceuticals Division sales increased by 5% at CER to CHF 41.2 billion, with growth in the oncology, immunology and neuroscience
therapeutic areas. The main products driving growth were the recently launched medicines Ocrevus, Tecentriq and Alecensa, which
contributed CHF 1.4 billion at CER of new sales. These three new products represented 65% of the division’s growth in 2017 and already
account for 4% of the division’s total sales. Other significant growth drivers were Perjeta, Xolair, Actemra/RoActemra and Herceptin.
MabThera/Rituxan growth was led by immunology. The first biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan were launched in several EU markets
from mid-2017 and led to decreased sales in Europe. Avastin sales declined by 2% under competitive pressure and sales of Tamiflu fell
by 33% due to generic competition in the US.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 11Roche Group | Financial Review
Ocrevus was launched in the US in April 2017 and has had a good uptake with sales of CHF 0.9 billion. The growth of Tecentriq sales was
driven mainly by uptake in the US in metastatic urothelial carcinoma and in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Alecensa sales were
101% higher, led by the US and Japan. The HER2 franchise continued to grow, with sales increasing by 7%. A main driver of this growth
was increased global demand for Perjeta in the neoadjuvant and metastatic settings. Herceptin sales were higher, notably in the US.
Sales increases in immunology came from Xolair in the US and increasing use of Actemra/RoActemra in the US and in Europe.

United States. Sales grew by 10% led by the uptake following the launches of Ocrevus and Tecentriq. Xolair sales (+16%) and Activase/
TNKase sales (+10%) both increased due to patient uptake. The HER2 franchise and MabThera/Rituxan also continued to grow (+9%
and +6% respectively). Tamiflu sales declined mainly due to competition from generics, and sales of Avastin fell by 2% due to competition
from immunotherapy medicines. Lucentis sales were broadly stable, while sales of Tarceva were lower due to competitive pressure.
Mandatory discounts to hospitals under the 340B Drug Discount Program increased, although at a lower rate than in 2016. This was
mainly due to higher utilisation of oncology products.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 15Roche Group | Financial Review
Europe. Sales decreased by 2%, mainly due to lower MabThera/Rituxan sales driven by competition from biosimilar versions which have
been launched in several EU markets in 2017. The HER2 franchise continued to grow (+6%) and was driven by Perjeta sales, especially
in the UK and Spain. Actemra/RoActemra sales increased due to growing demand for the subcutaneous formulation. Avastin sales
decreased primarily as a result from a delisting for metastatic breast cancer in France. Tamiflu sales in Europe were 74% lower due to
the base effect of a governmental order in the UK in 2016.
Japan. Sales grew by 3%. Alecensa sales increased by 41% due to further proceeded market penetration, Tamiflu by 25% and Actemra/
RoActemra by 10% and the osteoporosis medicine Edirol grew by 11%. This was partially offset by lower sales of various established
products.
International. Sales increased by 4% driven by Latin America and Asia-Pacific. Sales in China mainly grew due to additional
reimbursement as well as broader market penetration for Avastin. Sales in Brazil increased, led by Herceptin, which saw higher demand.
In Russia, sales declined as a result from the competition by non-comparable biologics for Herceptin.

Competition from generic medicines and biosimilars
The Group’s pharmaceutical products are generally protected by patent rights which are intended to provide the Group with exclusive
marketing rights in various countries. However, patent rights are of varying scope and duration, and the Group may be required to enter
into costly litigation to enforce its patent and other intellectual property rights. Loss of market exclusivity for one or more major products
– either due to patent expiration, challenges from generic medicines, biosimilars and non-comparable biologics or other reasons –
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations or financial condition. The introduction of a generic,
biosimilar or non-comparable biologic version of the same or a similar medicine typically results in a significant reduction in net sales
for the relevant product, as other manufacturers typically offer their versions at lower prices.
Patents and their expiry are, and always have been, an integral part of the Group’s business model and future growth will remain driven
by innovation. The latest information from clinical studies is included in the Annual Report on pages 40 to 53 and details of the Group’s
Product Development Portfolio are available for download at:

The intellectual property for biologics can involve multiple patents and patent timelines for each individual product and therefore it is more
difficult to give an exact date for patent expiry for biologic medicines. The Group currently estimates that some basic, primary patents
for its major biologic medicines will begin to expire as follows:
• MabThera/Rituxan: from around mid-2018 in the US.
• Herceptin: from mid-2019 in the US.
• Avastin: from mid-2019 in the US and from around 2020 in the EU.
• Subcutaneous formulations of MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin: beyond 2025 (secondary patent rights).
16 | Roche Finance Report 2017Financial Review | Roche Group
The ‘composition of matter’ patents for MabThera/Rituxan and Herceptin in the EU have expired. The first biosimilar versions of
MabThera/Rituxan were launched in several EU markets from mid-2017 and these were the major driver in the sales decline in Europe
in 2017.

MabThera/Rituxan – Europe 1,690 1,879 –11 First biosimilar launches from mid-2017
Based on publicly available information from competitor companies, the Group currently anticipates the following potential developments
in 2018:
• In the US, there are still many uncertainties surrounding when specific biosimilar versions of the Group’s biologic medicines will
be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The first biosimilar versions of MabThera/Rituxan could come to market in the US
around mid- to end-2018.
• In Europe, the first biosimilar versions of Herceptin could come to market during the first half of 2018.
• In Japan, the first biosimilar version of MabThera/Rituxan was approved and listed in late 2017. The first biosimilar versions of Herceptin
could also come to market in Japan during 2018.
Sales in 2017 for MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin are disclosed above in the previous sections, including regional breakdowns.

The increase of 18% at CER was mainly due to higher income from product disposals, which in 2017 included the sale of the worldwide
rights for Bonviva and Bondronat (both excluding US and Japan), Dilatrend and Kytril (excluding Japan). Royalty income increased by 2%
mainly due to a net increase in sales across the royalty portfolio, partly offset by the expiration of the royalty bearing Eylea patents.
Income from out-licensing agreements increased by 24% due to the out-licensing of lebrikizumab rights.

Core costs increased by 6% at CER and, as a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased by 0.2 percentage points to 21.1%.
Manufacturing cost of sales grew by 5%, in line with the sales growth. Increased costs from new manufacturing facilities being brought
online in recent years were partly offset by lower inventory write-offs. Royalty expenses were 5% higher due to Ocrevus sales in 2017.
Non-core costs include the amortisation of intangible assets, mainly related to the Esbriet product intangibles acquired in the InterMune
acquisition of 2014. The 2017 results additionally include CHF 1,664 million of impairment of these Esbriet intangibles, due to the lower-
than-expected sales of Esbriet in 2017 and a reduction in sales expectations in the latest long-term forecasts. The 2016 results included
the final fair value unwind adjustment of CHF 167 million for the acquired Esbriet inventories.

Core costs increased by 6% at CER and, as a percentage of sales, decreased by 0.1 percentage points to 21.9%. The oncology
franchise remained the primary area of research and development, with Tecentriq and the cancer immunotherapy portfolio being
key drivers. Neuroscience and immunology were also significant areas of spending, in both early-stage research and late-stage
development. In addition, the Pharmaceuticals Division in-licensed pipeline compounds and technologies with a total value of
CHF 736 million (2016: CHF 1,033 million), which are capitalised as intangible assets. The impairment charges of CHF 524 million include
an impairment of CHF 195 million for a compound acquired as part of the Trophos acquisition arising from the launch of a competitor
product and an impairment of CHF 149 million due to the decision to stop development of one compound with an alliance partner
following assessment of clinical and non-clinical data. Impairments totalling CHF 121 million were recorded following the write-off
of intangible assets acquired in the Dutalys and Santaris acquisitions.

in 2016 of CHF 310 million. Excluding this, core costs increased by 10% mainly due to higher legal service costs. There were also higher
personnel costs across the division. Impairments consist of the write-off of CHF 384 million of goodwill due to the decision to stop
development of the back-up compound acquired as part of the Seragon acquisition. The alliance and business combination income includes
the reversal of the contingent consideration provisions for the Seragon, Trophos and Dutalys acquisitions. Global restructuring costs
primarily relate to the divestment of the Florence, Segrate and Leganés sites.

Pharmaceuticals Division total core operating profit and operating profit both include the elimination of CHF minus 9 million of unrealised intercompany gains between
Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai (2016: CHF plus 127 million).
The decrease in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen has a negative impact of 4% on the Chugai results when expressed in Swiss francs.
Sales by Chugai to third parties increased by 3% in Japanese yen, while sales within the division increased by 22% in Japanese yen.
Chugai core operating profit increased by 27% due to higher sales and milestone income. This was partially offset by increased research
and development costs and higher general and administration costs. Operating free cash flow at Chugai increased by CHF 494 million
due to a decrease of inventories and higher operating profit.

The absolute amount of the movement between the 2017 and 2016 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2017 transactions (translated at average
rates for 2016) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2017 transactions include non-cash movements and therefore the movements in
this table are not the same as the amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only includes the cash movements). A full consolidated balance sheet is given on page 43
of the Annual Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given above is on page 147.
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc appreciated against
the US dollar, resulting in a negative translation impact on net operating assets. This is partially offset by the positive translation impact
from the euro against which the Swiss franc depreciated. The exchange rates used are given on page 28.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 19Roche Group | Financial Review
Net working capital. Net working capital decreased by 24%, due to lower inventories and a higher net liability for other receivables/
payables. Inventories decreased due to inventory write-offs and lower inventory levels for certain mature products, partly offset by higher
inventories for launch products. The net liability for other receivables/payables increased due to higher accruals for sales rebates and
chargebacks and for payroll. Other accrued liabilities in 2017 also included CHF 261 million for the Genentech property purchase option
exercise obligation, which is due in July 2018. Partially offsetting these effects, trade receivables increased due to higher sales and also
due to extended payment terms for Ocrevus in the US.
Long-term net operating assets. Overall long-term net operating assets decreased by 8%. Goodwill and intangible assets decreased
due to the significant impairments recorded in 2017. Capital expenditure included manufacturing investments in the US and Germany
and by Chugai in Japan, and also site development at the Basel and Kaiseraugst sites in Switzerland and at the South San Francisco
campus. Provisions decreased following the reversal of contingent consideration and legal provisions and the utilisation of restructuring
provisions. Other long-term net assets increased due to the reclassification from long-term to short-term of the CHF 261 million of
liabilities for the Genentech property purchase option exercise obligation due in July 2018.

See pages 144–146 for the definition of free cash flow and a detailed breakdown.
The Pharmaceuticals Division’s operating free cash flow increased by 21% to CHF 16.8 billion. The main contribution came from operating
profit, net of operating cash adjustments, with an increase of 7% at CER. This was higher than the increase in core operating profit of
4% due to the base effect of the income from pension changes in 2016. Net working capital absorbed less cash than at the start of the
year, mainly due to higher payables, partially offset by higher receivables. Most of the reduction in balance sheet inventories during 2017
came from non-cash effective write-downs. However, the build-up of inventories that occurred in 2016 was not repeated and this
contributed to the year-on-year growth in operating free cash flow. Capital expenditure was CHF 2.1 billion, with the major items as
described above in the ‘Financial position’ section. Capital expenditure and investments in intangible assets were lower than in 2016,
which contributed to the year-on-year growth in operating free cash flow.

Sales
The Diagnostics Division continued to increase sales with growth of 5% at CER to CHF 12.1 billion. Centralised and Point of Care
Solutions, with 7% sales growth, was the main contributor, led by its immunodiagnostics business. Molecular Diagnostics sales increased
by 4%, mainly driven by biochemical reagents, molecular diagnostics instruments and the human papillomavirus (HPV) screening.
Diabetes Care sales decreased by 4% due to continued challenging market conditions in the US. The growth in Tissue Diagnostics was
driven by the advanced staining product portfolio.

Centralised and Point of Care Solutions. With an increase in sales of 7%, this business area was the major contributor to the divisional
sales performance. Growth was primarily driven by the immunodiagnostics business (+13%), which represented 32% of divisional sales.
Sales growth was also supported by the clinical chemistry business (+3%). Regionally, sales grew in Asia-Pacific (+17%) due to growth
in China. The 3% sales growth reported in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (‘EMEA’) region was mainly due to the immunodiagnostics
business (+7%).

In North America sales were stable; the sales growth in Tissue Diagnostics (+8%) and Centralised and Point of Care Solutions (+1%)
were fully offset by lower sales in the Diabetes Care business, which fell by 23% due to continued price pressure. The sales increase
in Asia-Pacific was mainly in China, which grew by 21%. In Latin America sales rose by 10% due to new tender business and local
inflationary price increases. Sales growth in Japan was led by the Centralised and Point of Care Solutions business.

Core costs increased by 7% at CER. This was driven in part by an unfavourable product mix from higher instrument placements, notably
in the Asia-Pacific region. The remainder of the increase arose from higher depreciation of placed instruments. The core cost of sales ratio
increased to 46.8% from 46.1%. Impairment charges relate to the partial impairment of sequencing business intangible assets acquired
as part of the Ariosa acquisition. Global restructuring costs were mainly related to site closures and costs for the initiative to harmonise
processes and systems.

Core costs increased by 31% at CER compared to 2016 due to the base effect of income from changes in the Group’s Swiss pension
plans in 2016. Excluding this effect, core general and administration costs increased by 10%. Administration costs increased by 7%.
This was due to IT costs, additional headcount, notably in China, and the creation of new legal entities in the Diabetes Care business.
Business taxes included income from a settlement agreement for the Medical Devices Excise Tax in the US. Other general items in 2016
included income from underspending in IT and infrastructure areas. As a percentage of sales, core costs increased to 4.4% from 3.5%
in 2016. The impairment relates to goodwill for the sequencing business. Legal expenses mainly arose from increasing litigation costs in
the sequencing business.

The absolute amount of the movement between the 2017 and 2016 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2017 transactions (translated at average
rates for 2016) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2017 transactions include non-cash movements and therefore the movements in
this table are not the same as the amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only include the cash movements). A full consolidated balance sheet is given on page 43
of the Annual Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given above is on page 147.
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc depreciated significantly
against the euro, resulting in a positive translation impact on net operating assets. This was mostly offset by the appreciation of the
Swiss franc against the US dollar. The exchange rates used are given on page 28.
Net working capital. Net trade working capital increased by 1% at CER. Trade receivables increased by 3% driven by sales increase.
Inventories decreased by 5% due to inventories optimisation initiatives and high demand. Trade payables decreased by 4% due to lower
spending. The net liability for other receivables/payables increased due to higher liabilities for sales rebates.
Long-term net operating assets. Long-term net operating assets decreased by 4% at CER due to lower goodwill and intangible assets,
partially offset by higher property, plant and equipment and lower provisions. The 13% decrease in goodwill and intangible assets was
due to the impairments in the sequencing business and in Molecular Diagnostics. Property, plant and equipment increased by 6% due
to higher instrument placements and manufacturing site expansion in China and Germany. Provisions decreased by 11% following the
payment of milestones related to recent acquisitions.

The operating free cash flow of the Diagnostics Division was a net cash inflow of CHF 1,553 million compared to CHF 720 million in 2016.
The cash generation of the business, measured by the operating profit, net of operating cash adjustments, increased by 5%, in line
with the sales growth of 5%. The build-up in net working capital in 2016, notably in inventories, was not repeated and this contributed
to the year-on-year growth in operating free cash flow. Capital expenditure was CHF 1.4 billion, with the major items as described above
in the ‘Financial position’ section. Capital expenditure was lower than in 2016, which included significant site expansions.

General and administration costs increased by 22% at CER on a core basis, driven by the base effect of income from pension changes
in 2016. Excluding this, core costs were higher by 11% due to impairment of corporate assets, increased personnel related costs and
corporate project activities. Total costs on IFRS basis increased by 27% and included restructuring expenses in 2017 which offset legal
and environmental costs in 2016.
The change in net operating assets was due to the utilisation of provisions for ongoing environmental remediation activities at Nutley
in the US and at Grenzach in Germany and also due to the impairment of assets. Corporate operating free cash flow showed a higher
outflow, which was broadly in line with the growth of core costs excluding the impact of the pension plans changes.

In 2017 compared to 2016, the Swiss franc was weaker against the euro and other European currencies and against several major
currencies in the Asia-Pacific region. This was partially offset by the Swiss franc being stronger against the Japanese yen. The Swiss franc
remained stable against the US dollar. The net impact is negligible on the results expressed in Swiss francs compared to constant
exchange rates for sales, core operating profit and Core EPS.
The sensitivity of Group sales and core operating profit to a 1% change in average foreign currency exchange rates against the Swiss franc
during 2017 is shown in the table below.

The Group’s revenues are primarily generated from sales of products to customers. Such revenues are mainly received in the local
currency of the customer’s home market, although in certain emerging markets invoicing is made in major international currencies such
as the US dollar and euro. The costs of sales and marketing and also some administration costs follow the same currency pattern as
sales. The majority of research and development activities are incurred at the Group’s global research facilities, and therefore the costs
are mainly concentrated in US dollars, Swiss francs and euros. General and administration costs tend to be incurred mainly at central
locations in the US, Switzerland and Germany. Chugai’s revenues and costs are denominated in Japanese yen.

Financing costs
Core financing costs were CHF 819 million, a decrease of 21% at CER compared to 2016. Interest expenses (including amortisation of
debt discount and issue costs) decreased by 15% to CHF 598 million from CHF 707 million in 2016 due to the continued repayment and
refinancing of debt at lower interest rates. Losses on bond redemptions in 2017 were CHF 74 million compared to CHF 142 million in 2016.
The net interest cost of defined benefit pension plans decreased by 22% at CER to CHF 147 million mainly due to lower discount rates in
Germany at the end of 2016. A full analysis of financing costs is given in Note 3 to the Annual Financial Statements and details of the debt
repayments and redemptions are given in Note 20.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 29Roche Group | Financial Review
Other financial income (expense)
Core other financial income (expense) was a net income of CHF 75 million compared to a net income of CHF 37 million in 2016 due
to lower foreign exchange losses and higher net income from equity securities. The net foreign exchange results reflect hedging costs
and losses on unhedged positions and were a net loss of CHF 115 million compared to a net loss of CHF 124 million in 2016. Core net
income from equity securities was CHF 162 million in 2017 compared to CHF 154 million in 2016. A full analysis of other financial income
(expense) is given in Note 3 to the Annual Financial Statements.
Income taxes
The Group’s effective core tax rate decreased by 0.6 percentage points to 26.6% in 2017. This was largely due to mix effects within
the manufacturing supply chain.
The IFRS results show an increase in the effective tax rate of 2.7 percentage points mainly due to the transitional effect of changes
in US tax rates, as described below, and the non-core results including significant goodwill impairments that are not tax deductible.
The IFRS results also include non-core income from the releases of contingent consideration provisions that is not taxable, hence
the net tax effect in the ‘Alliances and business combinations’ line in the table below.
Changes to US tax rates were enacted on 22 December 2017 that will become effective from 1 January 2018. Among the changes is
a decrease in the US Federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Group has carried out a remeasurement of its deferred tax positions and
as a consequence the net deferred tax asset recorded on the balance sheet was reduced by CHF 346 million as of the end of 2017.
This resulted in a transitional expense of CHF 116 million in 2017 which has been treated as a non-core item. The remaining adjustments
of CHF 230 million were recorded to other comprehensive income, in so far as they relate to temporary differences arising on items that
were themselves recorded to other comprehensive income, such as actuarial gains/losses on US pension plans. Had these new rates
applied for the whole of 2017, and excluding any transition impacts, the Group’s 2017 effective core tax rate in percentage terms, would
have been in the low twenties.
Further details of the Group’s income tax expenses and related balance sheet positions are given in Note 4 to the Annual Financial
Statements.

Financial position
The decrease in net debt was due to free cash flow of CHF 13.4 billion, partly offset by dividend payments of CHF 7.1 billion. The net
pension liability decreased due to improved asset performance. The net tax liabilities decreased mainly due to the deferred tax impact
from the impairment of intangible assets, partially offset by the deferred tax impact from the changes in US tax rates announced in late
2017. At 31 December 2017 the Group held financial long-term assets with a market value of CHF 0.5 billion, which consist mostly of
holdings in biotechnology and other pharmaceuticals companies acquired as part of licensing transactions or scientific collaborations.
Compared to the start of the year, the Swiss franc appreciated against the US dollar, which had a positive translation impact on the
Group’s net debt, due to the US dollar-denominated debt translating into a lower Swiss franc amount at year-end.
30 | Roche Finance Report 2017Financial Review | Roche Group
Free cash flow
The cash outflow from treasury activities decreased to CHF 0.5 billion due to lower pension contributions and lower interest payments
in 2017, as well as the base effect of investments in financial long-term assets in 2016. Total taxes paid in 2017 were up by 5% to
CHF 3.9 billion due to higher tax payments in the US.

For the definition of free cash flow and a detailed breakdown see pages 144–146.
Operating free cash flow increased by CHF 3.7 billion, or 26% at CER, to CHF 17.8 billion. A major factor in this significant increase was
the growth in the underlying cash generated from operations, which increased by 7% to CHF 21.6 billion. The lower net working capital
also contributed to the overall operating free cash flow and, compared to the increase in net working capital in 2016, especially impacted
the year-on-year growth rate. In addition, capital expenditure was 15% lower than 2016.
The cash outflow from treasury activities went down to CHF 0.5 billion due to lower pension contributions and lower interest payments
in 2017 as well as the base effect of higher investments in financial long-term assets in 2016. Taxes paid were 5% higher at CHF 3.9 billion
due to higher US tax payments. The free cash flow of CHF 13.4 billion was significantly higher than in 2016, due to the higher operating
free cash flow and lower net cash outflow from treasury operations.

1) US dollar-denominated debt includes those bonds and notes denominated in euros that were swapped into US dollars, and therefore in the consolidated results they have
economic characteristics equivalent to US dollar-denominated bonds and notes.
The net debt position of the Group at 31 December 2017 was CHF 7.0 billion, a decrease of CHF 6.3 billion from 31 December 2016.
The decrease was due to the strong free cash flow partly offset by dividend payments of CHF 7.1 billion.
The issuance, redemption and repurchase of bonds and notes during 2017 (see Note 20 to the Annual Financial Statements) had
an impact on liquid funds, but had no impact on the net debt position.

Debt. This consists mainly of bonds and notes and includes the principal and interest on the Group’s debt instruments. Other debt is
mainly commercial paper. The carrying values are discounted based on the interest rates inherent in the instruments.
Contingent consideration provisions. These are potential payments arising from business combinations. The carrying values are risk-
adjusted and discounted.
Unfunded defined benefit plans. These are mainly the pension plans in the Group’s German affiliates, where the fully reserved pension
obligations are invested in the local affiliate’s operations. The carrying values are discounted. Future company contributions to the
Group’s funded plans are not shown in the above table.
Capital commitments for property, plant and equipment. These are non-cancellable commitments for the purchase and construction
mainly at the Roche sites in Basel (Switzerland), Mannheim (Germany) and South San Francisco (US) and also at the Chugai sites.
Operating leases. These are the future obligations under non-cancellable lease contracts. In 2019 the Group will implement IFRS 16
‘Leases’ and at that point these obligations will be reported in the balance sheet.
Contract manufacturing commitments. These are the future minimum take-or-pay commitments to purchase inventories arising from
the Group’s major long-term agreements with external Contract Manufacturing Organisations (‘CMOs’).
Alliance collaboration commitments. These are potential upfront and milestone payments that may become due from the Group’s
in-licensing arrangements. Potential payments to alliance partners and for asset deals within the next three years are included assuming
all projects currently in development are successful. Potential payments beyond three years are only included for asset deals.
Provisions for legal and environmental matters. These are not included in the above table as the timing and amount of any cash
outflow is uncertain and contingent on the development of the matters in question.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 33Roche Group | Financial Review
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate
fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. In 2017
expenses for the Group’s defined contribution plans were CHF 482 million (2016: CHF 473 million). All other plans are classified as
‘defined benefit plans’, even if the Group’s potential obligation is minor or has a relatively remote possibility of arising. Plans are usually
established as trusts which are independent of the Group and are funded by payments from the Group and by employees, but in some
cases the plan is unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources.
Defined benefit plans
During 2016 operating income of CHF 426 million was recorded for past service costs from changes to the Group’s pension plans in
Switzerland. This represents the impact of the adjustment of the pension liability for the plan changes announced in 2016. In 2017 expenses
for the Group’s defined benefit plans were CHF 658 million (2016 excluding past service costs: CHF 718 million). Based on the revised
actuarial assumptions at the end of 2017, expenses for the Group’s defined benefit plans in 2018 are expected to be approximately
CHF 651 million, in line with 2017. These estimates for 2018 pension expenses do not include any settlement or past service/curtailment
effects that might arise during the year.

Overall the funding status on an IFRS basis of the Group’s funded defined benefit plans increased to 91% compared to 86% at the start of
the year. Plan assets increased by CHF 0.8 billion driven by higher returns on assets which are partially offset by other items including
settlement payments made in the US and Ireland. The funded status of the pension funds is monitored by the local pension fund governance
bodies as well as being closely reviewed at a Group level. During 2017 additional contributions were paid into the Group’s pension plans in
the US and the UK. The total cash outflow from the Group’s defined benefit plans in 2017 was CHF 538 million compared to CHF 880 million
in 2016, which included additional contributions that were paid into the Group’s pension plans in Switzerland, the US and Ireland in that
year.
The unfunded plans are mainly those in the Group’s German affiliates, where the fully reserved pension obligations are invested in
the local affiliate’s operations. The unfunded liabilities for these plans increased by CHF 480 million during 2017 mainly due to the currency
translation effect from the increase in the euro against the Swiss franc during the year.
Full details of the Group’s pensions and other post-employment benefits are given in Note 25 to the Annual Financial Statements.

In 2017 Roche ranked number 11 among a peer group consisting of Roche and 15 other healthcare companies1) for Total Shareholder
Return (TSR), defined as share price growth plus dividends, measured in Swiss francs at actual exchange rates. At constant exchange
rates (CER) Roche ranked number 10, with the year-end return being +7% for Roche shares and +9% for Roche non-voting equity
securities. The combined performance of share and non-voting equity security was +9% compared to a weighted average return for
the peer group of +16% in CHF terms and +18% at CER.
The healthcare sector experienced a positive performance together with the world markets in 2017 driven by a recovery in the global
economy and the normalisation of monetary policy in both the US and the EU being more gradual than expected. The Swiss Market
Index (SMI) posted gains in 2017. However, the performance was mixed relative to other major global indices, as currency movements
continued to influence investors’ exposure to Swiss equities, with the SMI underperforming major US indices but outperforming
European indices. In this context, even with positive read-outs at the end of the 2017, the Roche share performance continues to be
impacted by investor concern over the biosimilar impact and competition in cancer immunotherapy.

Proposed dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing an increase of 1% in the dividend for 2017 to CHF 8.30 per share and non-voting equity security
(2016: CHF 8.20) for approval at the Annual General Meeting. This is the 31st consecutive increase in the dividend. If the dividend
proposal is approved by shareholders, dividend payments on the total shares and non-voting equity securities will amount to CHF 7.2 billion
(2016: CHF 7.1 billion), resulting in a pay-out ratio (based on core net income) of 54.1% (2016: 56.4%). Based on the prices at year-end
2017, the dividend yield on the Roche share was 3.4% (2016: 3.4%) and the yield on the non-voting equity security was 3.4% (2016: 3.5%).
Further information on the Roche securities is given on pages 149 to 150.

2) Of the proceeds from these bonds and notes, EUR 850 million has been swapped into US dollars, and therefore in the consolidated results these bonds and notes have economic
characteristics equivalent to US dollar-denominated bonds and notes.
The Group plans to meet its debt obligations using existing liquid funds as well as cash generated from business operations. In 2017
the free cash flow was CHF 13.4 billion, which included the cash generated from operations, as well as payment of interest and tax.
For short-term financing requirements, the Group has a commercial paper programme in the US under which it can issue up to
USD 7.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper notes and has committed credit lines of USD 7.5 billion available as back-stop lines.
Commercial paper notes totalling USD 0.8 billion were outstanding as of 31 December 2017 (2016: USD 2.1 billion). For longer-term
financing the Group maintains strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA by Standard & Poor’s and A1 by Moody’s which
should facilitate efficient access to international capital markets.
Further information on the Group’s debt is given in Note 20 to the Annual Financial Statements.

Financial risks
At 31 December 2017 the Group has a net debt position of CHF 7.0 billion (2016: CHF 13.2 billion). The financial assets of the Group
are managed in a conservative way with the objective to meet the Group’s financial obligations at all times.
Asset allocation. A considerable portion of the cash and marketable securities the Group currently holds is being used for debt
redemptions. Liquid funds are either held as cash or are invested in high-quality, investment-grade fixed income securities with
an investment horizon to meet those liquidity requirements.
Cash and marketable securities
2017 2016
(CHF m) (% of total) (CHF m) (% of total)
Cash and cash equivalents 4,719 39 4,163 46
Money market instruments 6,107 51 3,366 36
Debt securities 1,161 10 1,509 17
Equity securities 10 0 69 1
Total cash and marketable securities 11,997 100 9,107 100
Credit risk. Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations causing financial
losses for the Group. The rating profile of the Group’s CHF 12.0 billion of cash and fixed income marketable securities remained strong
with 91% being invested in the A-AAA range. The Group has signed netting and collateral agreements with the counterparties in order
to mitigate counterparty risk on derivative positions.
The Group has trade receivables of CHF 10.4 billion. Since the beginning of 2010 there have been financial difficulties in Southern
European countries, notably Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. The Group is a leading supplier to the healthcare sectors in these
countries and at 31 December 2017 has trade receivables of EUR 0.5 billion (CHF 0.6 billion) with public customers in these countries.
This is an increase of 13% compared to 31 December 2016 in euro terms due to the substantial collections in late 2016 prior to the year-
end. The Group uses different measures to improve collections in these countries, including intense communication with customers,
factoring, negotiations of payment plans, charging of interest for late payments, and legal actions. Since 2011 the Group’s trade
receivables balance in Southern Europe has decreased by 60% in euro terms.
Liquidity risk. Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time.
The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements at any
point in time. In addition to the current liquidity position, the Group has good cash generation ability. Those future cash flows will be
used to repay debt instruments in the coming years.
Roche enjoys strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA by Standard & Poor’s and A1 by Moody’s. At the same time Roche
is rated at the highest available short-term ratings by those agencies. In the event of financing requirements, the ratings and overall
creditworthiness of the Roche Group should permit efficient access to international capital markets, including the commercial paper
market. The Group has committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling USD 7.5 billion available as back-stop lines
for the commercial paper programme. As at 31 December 2017 no debt has been drawn under these credit lines.
Market risk. Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities. The exposures are
predominantly related to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to assess
the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. VaR data indicates the value range within which a given financial instrument will
fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices. The Group’s VaR remained stable during 2017.
Interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could affect the Group financial result or the value
of the Group equity. The Group may use interest rate derivatives to manage its interest-rate-related exposure and financial result.
Further information on financial risk management and financial risks and the VaR methodology is included in Note 29 to the Annual
Financial Statements.

International Financial Reporting Standards
The Roche Group has been using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to report its consolidated results since 1990.
In 2017 the Group has implemented various minor amendments to existing standards and interpretations, which have no material impact
on the Group’s overall results and financial position.
New and revised standards that will be applied in 2018
The Group has assessed the expected impacts of the various new and revised standards and interpretations that will be mandatory
from 1 January 2018 which the Group has not yet applied, as summarised below. The Group does not anticipate that these will have
a material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position. Furthermore, no restatements of the 2017 comparative results
will be necessary when the new standards are applied in 2018. See Note 32 to the Annual Financial Statements for further details.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’. The Group will implement the new standard effective 1 January 2018 and will apply the exemption
from full retrospective application for the classification and measurement requirements, including impairment, meaning that the
comparative 2017 results will not be restated when the new standard is applied. The standard deals with the classification, recognition
and measurement (including impairment) of financial instruments, the impairment of financial assets, including trade and lease
receivables and also introduces a new hedge accounting model.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenues from Contracts with Customers’. The Group will implement the new standard effective 1 January 2018 and will
apply the full retrospective method for the transition. Since the new standard does not change the amounts of revenue recognised for
2017 no restatements of the comparative 2017 results will be necessary. The new standard contains a new set of principles on when
and how to recognise and measure revenue as well as new requirements related to presentation. The core principle in that framework
is that revenue should be recognised dependent on the transfer of promised goods or services to the customer for an amount that
reflects the consideration which should be received in exchange for those goods or services.
New and revised standards that will be applied in 2019 and beyond
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’. The Group will implement the new standard effective 1 January 2019 and will apply the cumulative catch-up method
option for the transition, meaning that the comparative 2018 results will not be restated when the new standard is applied. The main
impact of the new standard will be to bring operating leases on-balance sheet. The Group is assessing the potential impact, but currently
anticipates that the new standard will result in the carrying value of leased assets being increased by approximately CHF 1.2 billion,
with lease liabilities increased by a similar amount at the date of implementation. The application of the new standard will result in part
of what is currently reported as operating lease costs being recorded as interest expenses. Given the leases involved and the prevailing
low interest rate environment the Group does not currently expect this effect to be material.
See Note 32 to the Annual Financial Statements for further details of these matters.

Consolidated Financial Statements
1. General accounting principles
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements (hereafter ‘the Annual Financial Statements’) of the Roche Group have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. They have been prepared using the historical cost
convention except for items that are required to be accounted for at fair value. They were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on
29 January 2018 and are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders on 13 March 2018.
These financial statements are the Annual Financial Statements of Roche Holding Ltd, a company registered in Switzerland, and its
subsidiaries (‘the Group’).
The Group’s significant accounting policies and changes in accounting policies are disclosed in Note 32.
Key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Annual Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingent amounts. Actual outcomes could differ from those management
estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various
other factors. Revisions to estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. The following are considered to be the
key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions made and are believed to be appropriate based upon currently available information.
Revenue. The nature of the Group’s business is such that many sales transactions do not have a simple structure and may consist
of multiple components occurring at different times. The Group is also party to out-licensing agreements which involve upfront and
milestone payments occurring over several years and which may also involve certain future obligations. Revenue is only recognised
when, in management’s judgement, the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred and when the Group does not
retain continuing managerial involvement or effective control over the goods sold or when the obligation has been fulfilled. For some
transactions this can result in cash receipts being initially recognised as deferred income and then released to income over subsequent
periods on the basis of the performance of the conditions specified in the agreement. There may be circumstances such that the level of
sales returns, and hence revenues, cannot be reliably measured. In such cases sales are only recognised when the right of return expires,
which is generally upon prescription of the products to patients. In order to estimate this, management uses publicly available information
about prescriptions as well as information provided by wholesalers and other intermediaries.
Revenues from product sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts and estimates of product
returns, all of which are established at the time of sale. All product sales allowances are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to
be claimed on the related sales. At 31 December 2017 the Group had CHF 3,023 million in provisions and accruals for expected sales
returns, chargebacks and other rebates, including Medicaid in the US and similar rebates in other countries. The provisions and accruals
relating to the US Pharmaceuticals business amounted to CHF 1,445 million, of which CHF 337 million related to expected sales returns.
These estimates take into consideration historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market
events and trends such as competitive pricing and new product introductions, estimated inventory levels, and the shelf life of products.
If actual future results vary, these estimates need to be adjusted, which could have an effect on sales and earnings in the period of the
adjustment. At 31 December 2017 the Group had CHF 517 million in provisions for doubtful receivables (see Note 11). Such estimates
are based on analyses of ageing of customer balances, specific credit circumstances, historical trends and the Group’s experience,
taking also into account current economic conditions.
Business combinations. The Group initially recognises the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non-
controlling interest and the consideration transferred in a business combination. Management judgement is particularly involved in the
recognition and fair value measurement of intellectual property, inventories, contingent liabilities and contingent consideration. In making
this assessment, management considers the underlying economic substance of the items concerned in addition to the contractual terms.
46 | Roche Finance Report 2017Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Impairment. At 31 December 2017 the Group had CHF 20,912 million in property, plant and equipment (see Note 7), CHF 10,077 million
in goodwill (see Note 8) and CHF 8,368 million in intangible assets (see Note 9). Goodwill and intangible assets not yet available for use
are reviewed annually for impairment. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in use are assessed for impairment when
there is a triggering event that provides evidence that an asset may be impaired. To assess whether any impairment exists, estimates of
expected future cash flows are used. Actual outcomes could vary significantly from such estimates. Factors such as changes in discount
rates, the planned use of buildings, machinery or equipment or closure of facilities, the presence of competition, technical obsolescence
and lower-than-anticipated product sales could lead to shorter useful lives or impairment.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits. The Group operates a number of defined benefit plans and the fair values of
the recognised plan assets and liabilities are based upon statistical and actuarial calculations. The measurement of the net defined
benefit obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate, inflation rate, expected mortality and medical cost trend
rate assumptions. At 31 December 2017 the present value of the Group’s defined benefit obligation is CHF 21,116 million (see Note 25).
The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changes in market and economic conditions, longer
or shorter life spans of participants, and other changes in the factors being assessed. These differences could impact on the defined
benefit plan assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Legal provisions. The Group provides for anticipated legal settlement costs when there is a probable outflow of resources that can
be reliably estimated. At 31 December 2017 the Group had CHF 485 million in legal provisions. The status of significant legal cases is
disclosed in Note 19. These estimates consider the specific circumstances of each legal case, relevant legal advice and are inherently
judgemental due to the highly complex nature of legal cases. The estimates could change substantially over time as new facts emerge
and each legal case progresses. Where no reliable estimate can be made, no provision is recorded and contingent liabilities are disclosed
where material.
Environmental provisions. The Group provides for anticipated environmental remediation costs when there is a probable outflow
of resources that can be reasonably estimated. At 31 December 2017 the Group had CHF 523 million in environmental provisions
(see Note 19). Environmental provisions consist primarily of costs to fully clean and refurbish contaminated sites, including landfills,
and to treat and contain contamination at certain other sites. These estimates are inherently judgemental due to uncertainties related
to the detection of previously unknown contamination, the method and extent of remediation, the percentage of the problematic
materials attributable to the Group at the remediation sites, and the financial capabilities of other potentially responsible parties.
The estimates could change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each environmental remediation progresses.
Contingent consideration provisions. The Group makes provision for the estimated fair value of contingent consideration arrangements
arising from business combinations. At 31 December 2017 the Group had CHF 591 million in contingent consideration provisions
(see Note 19) and the total potential payments under contingent consideration arrangements from business combinations could be
up to CHF 1,423 million (see Note 29). The estimated amounts provided are the expected payments, determined by considering the
possible scenarios of forecast sales and other performance criteria, the amount to be paid under each scenario, and the probability
of each scenario, which is then discounted to a net present value. The estimates could change substantially over time as new facts
emerge and each scenario develops.
Income taxes. At 31 December 2017 the Group had a current income tax net liability of CHF 3,060 million and a deferred tax net asset
of CHF 3,081 million (see Note 4). Significant estimates are required to determine the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Where tax positions are uncertain, accruals
are recorded within income tax liabilities for management’s best estimate of the ultimate liability that is expected to arise based on
the specific circumstances and the Group’s historical experience. Factors that may have an impact on current and deferred taxes include
changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, future levels of research and
development spending and changes in pre-tax earnings.
Leases. The treatment of leasing transactions is mainly determined by whether the lease is considered to be an operating or finance
lease. In making this assessment, management looks at the substance of the lease, as well as the legal form, and makes a judgement
about whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Arrangements which do not take the legal form
of a lease but that nevertheless convey the right to use an asset are also covered by such assessments.
Consolidation. The Group periodically undertakes transactions that may involve obtaining control or significant influence of other
companies. These transactions include equity acquisitions, asset purchases and alliance agreements. In all such cases management
makes an assessment as to whether the Group has control or significant influence of the other company, and whether it should
be consolidated as a subsidiary or accounted for as an associated company. In making this assessment, management considers
the underlying economic substance of the transaction in addition to the contractual terms.

2. Operating segment information
The Group has two divisions, Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics. Revenues are primarily generated from the sale of prescription
pharmaceutical products and diagnostic instruments, reagents and consumables respectively. Both divisions also derive revenues from
the sale or licensing of products or technology to third parties. Residual operating activities from divested businesses and certain global
activities are reported as ‘Corporate’. These include the Corporate Executive Committee and global group functions for communications,
human resources, finance (including treasury, taxes and pension fund management), legal, safety and environmental services.
Subdivisional information for Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai, operating segments within the Pharmaceuticals Division, is also
presented.

Supplementary unaudited information on sales by therapeutic areas in the Pharmaceuticals Division and by business areas in the
Diagnostics Division are given in the Financial Review. Sales are allocated to geographical areas by destination according to the location
of the customer. Royalties and other operating income are allocated according to the location of the Group company that receives
the revenue.

Major customers
In total three US national wholesale distributors represent approximately a third of the Group’s revenues in 2017. The three US national
wholesale distributors are McKesson Corp. with CHF 7 billion (2016: CHF 6 billion), AmerisourceBergen Corp. with CHF 6 billion
(2016: CHF 6 billion) and Cardinal Health, Inc. with CHF 5 billion (2016: CHF 4 billion). Approximately 96% of these revenues were in
the Pharmaceuticals operating segment, with the residual in the Diagnostics segment.
Supplementary revenues information
Revenues from product sales are recorded net of allowances for estimated rebates, chargebacks, cash discounts and estimates of
product returns, all of which are established at the time of sale. All product sales allowances are based on estimates of the amounts
earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration historical experience, current contractual and
statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends such as competitive pricing and new product introductions, estimated
inventory levels, and the shelf life of products. If actual future results vary, these estimates need to be adjusted, which could have an
effect on sales and earnings in the period of the adjustment.
The gross-to-net sales reconciliation for the Pharmaceuticals Division is shown in the table below. The companies in the Diagnostics
Division have similar reconciling items, but at much lower amounts.

Government and regulatory mandatory price reductions. These consist of mandatory price reductions. The major elements are
340B Drug Discount Program, Medicaid, and other plans in the US, which totalled USD 4.7 billion, equivalent to CHF 4.7 billion
(2016: USD 3.7 billion, equivalent to CHF 3.7 billion).
Contractual price reductions. These include rebates and chargebacks that are the result of contractual agreements that are primarily
volume-based and performance-based.
Cash discounts. These include credits offered to wholesalers for remitting payment on their purchases within contractually defined
incentive periods.
Customer returns reserves. These are allowances established for expected product returns.
Sales reductions that are expected to be withheld by the customer upon settlement, such as contractual price reductions and cash
discounts, are recorded in the balance sheet as a deduction from trade receivables (see Note 11). Sales reductions that are separately
payable to customers, governmental health authorities or healthcare regulatory authorities are recorded in the balance sheet as
accrued liabilities (see Note 18). Provisions for sales returns are recorded in the balance sheet as other provisions (see Note 19).

Since the Group operates internationally, it is subject to income taxes in many different tax jurisdictions. The Group calculates its average
expected tax rate as a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates. This rate changes from year
to year due to changes in the mix of the Group’s taxable income and changes in local tax rates.
The Group’s average expected tax rate decreased to 21.5% in 2017 (2016: 24.7%). The decrease was mainly due to the lower proportion
of the Group’s profits from the US, which has a relatively higher local tax rate than the Group’s average tax rate. The lower proportion
of US profits was driven by goodwill impairments in 2017.
The Group’s effective tax rate increased to 27.9% in 2017 (2016: 25.2%). The main drivers for the increase were the goodwill impairments
mentioned above, which are not tax deductible, the impact from the intra-group transfer of intangible rights in 2016 and the transitional
effect of changes in US tax rates.
On 22 December 2017 changes to US tax rates were enacted that will become effective from 1 January 2018. Among the changes
is a decrease in the US Federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Group has carried out a remeasurement of its deferred tax positions
and as a consequence the net deferred tax asset recorded on the balance sheet was reduced by CHF 346 million as of the end of 2017.
This resulted in a transitional expense of CHF 116 million in 2017. The remaining adjustments of CHF 230 million were recorded
to other comprehensive income, in so far as they relate to temporary differences arising on items that were themselves recorded
to other comprehensive income, such as actuarial gains/losses on US pension plans.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 53Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
The Group’s effective tax rate can be reconciled to the Group’s average expected tax rate as follows:
Reconciliation of the Group’s effective tax rate
2017 2016
Average expected tax rate 21.5% 24.7%
Tax effect of
– Non-taxable income/non-deductible expenses +4.8% +1.3%
– Equity compensation plans +0.2% +0.8%
– Research and development tax credits and manufacturing deductions –2.9% –2.6%
– US state tax impacts +0.5% +0.7%
– Tax on unremitted earnings +1.7% +1.7%
– Utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses – –0.3%
– Deferred tax on intra-group transfers – –2.3%
– Transitional effect of changes in US tax rates +0.9% –
– Prior year and other differences +1.2% +1.2%
Group’s effective tax rate 27.9% 25.2%
The income tax benefit recorded in respect of equity compensation plans, which varies according to the price of the underlying equity,
was CHF 87 million (2016: CHF 3 million). Had the income tax benefits been recorded solely on the basis of the IFRS 2 expense multiplied

The deferred tax net assets for other temporary differences mainly relate to accrued and other liabilities, provisions and unrealised profit
in inventory.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward only to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit is probable.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses, including valuation allowances, as follows:
Unrecognised tax losses: expiry

Total unrecognised tax losses 11,461 6% 10,302 6%
The ‘More than five years’ category includes losses that cannot be used for US state income tax purposes in those states which only
permit tax reporting on a separate entity basis.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been established for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the remittance
of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, where such amounts are currently regarded as permanently reinvested for the purpose of these
financial statements. The total unremitted earnings of the Group, regarded as permanently reinvested for the purpose of these financial
statements, were CHF 29.1 billion at 31 December 2017 (2016: CHF 29.9 billion).

5. Business combinations
Acquisitions – 2017
mySugr GmbH. On 29 June 2017 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in mySugr GmbH (‘mySugr’), a private company based
in Vienna, Austria. mySugr has developed one of the leading mobile diabetes platforms in the market and will become part of the Group’s
new digital health services in diabetes care. The acquisition of mySugr expands the Group’s leading position in the area of diabetes
management. mySugr is reported in the Diagnostics operating segment as part of the Diabetes Care business. The total cash
consideration was EUR 64 million.
Viewics, Inc. On 27 November 2017 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Viewics, Inc. (‘Viewics’), a US privately owned
company based in San Jose, California. Viewics is a software company focused on a laboratory business analytics solution. The acquisition
of Viewics expands the Group’s leading position in the integrated core lab with business analytics capabilities, enabling laboratories to
make faster data-driven informed decisions on their operations and processes. Viewics is reported in the Diagnostics operating segment.
The total consideration was USD 81 million, of which USD 62 million was paid in cash, USD 9 million was deferred consideration which
will be paid over the period from the date of control to 2021 and USD 10 million arose from a contingent consideration arrangement.
The contingent payments are based on the achievement of performance-related milestones and the range of undiscounted outcomes
is between zero and USD 10 million.
The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table below. The amounts for mySugr and Viewics are
provisional based on preliminary information and valuations of the assets and liabilities and subject to adjustment during 2018.

The fair value of the product intangible asset for mySugr is determined using a replacement cost method. The fair value of the other
intangible assets is determined using an excess earning method that is based on management forecasts and observable market data
for discount rates, tax rates and foreign exchange rates. The present value is calculated using a risk-adjusted discount rate of 13.0%
for mySugr and 9.5% for Viewics. The valuations were performed by independent valuers.
The Viewics accounts receivable is comprised of gross contractual amounts due of CHF 2 million which were all expected to be
collectable at the date of the acquisition.
Goodwill represents a control premium, the acquired work force and the synergies that can be expected from integrating the acquired
companies into the Group’s existing business. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
56 | Roche Finance Report 2017Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
The Group recognised a financial gain of CHF 7 million and CHF 2 million respectively for fair valuing the 12% interest in mySugr and
the 10% interest in Viewics held by the Group prior to the transaction. This gain is included in other financial income (expense) for 2017.
Directly attributable transaction costs of CHF 2 million were reported in the Diagnostics operating segment within general and
administration expenses.
The impact of the mySugr and Viewics acquisitions on the 2017 results for the Diagnostics Division and the Group were not material.
Future acquisitions
Ignyta, Inc. On 22 December 2017 the Group announced that it had entered into a merger agreement with Ignyta, Inc. (‘Ignyta’) to fully
acquire Ignyta at a price of USD 27.00 per share in an all-cash transaction. This corresponds to a total transaction value of USD 1.7 billion
on a fully diluted basis. Ignyta is a publicly owned US company based in San Diego, California, and is listed on Nasdaq under the stock
code ‘RXDX’. The closing of the transaction is expected to take place in the first half of 2018 and will be subject to a majority of Ignyta’s
outstanding shares being tendered to the Group, to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other customary conditions. Upon closing, Ignyta will be reported in the Pharmaceuticals Division.

2) Includes the Pharmaceuticals Division’s strategic realignment of its manufacturing network and resourcing flexibility in biologics manufacturing network.
3) Includes plans for resourcing flexibility in the Pharmaceuticals Division’s commercial operations and global product development/strategy organisations and the Pharmaceuticals
Division’s research and development strategic realignment and outsourcing of IT and other functions.
Diagnostics Division
In 2017 strategy plans in the Diagnostics Division that were launched in 2016 incurred costs of CHF 212 million mainly for employee-
related costs (2016: CHF 106 million related to site closures and employees). Spending on other smaller plans within the division was
CHF 80 million (2016: CHF 206 million) and included costs related to the ‘Autonomy and Speed’ initiative in Diabetes Care and certain
IT projects.
58 | Roche Finance Report 2017Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Site consolidation
On 12 November 2015 the Pharmaceuticals Division announced a strategic realignment of its manufacturing network including exiting
from the manufacturing sites at Clarecastle, Ireland; Leganés, Spain; Segrate, Italy; and Florence, US. Costs from this plan in 2017 were
CHF 480 million (2016: CHF 733 million), of which CHF 185 million were non-cash impairments and accelerated depreciation of property,
plant and equipment (2016: CHF 337 million). Some employee-related provisions were reversed as the most likely scenario for the Segrate
site was changed from closure to divestment. The divestment of the Florence, Segrate and Leganés sites have been completed in 2017
and result in total costs of CHF 201 million. This includes CHF 100 million of accumulated currency translation losses on consolidation
that were transferred to the income statement (see Note 22). The expected costs of the environmental remediation at the Clarecastle
site were reassessed and resulted in an increase in provisions for environmental remediation (see Note 19). Other plans include the
resourcing flexibility in biologics manufacturing network which resulted in headcount reductions in the US and also at the Kaiseraugst
site in Switzerland and the exit from the small molecules manufacturing site at Toluca, Mexico.
The divestment of the Nutley site in the US was completed in the second half of 2016 and resulted in an increase in provisions for
environmental remediation.
Other global restructuring plans
In 2017 total costs were CHF 332 million, with the major item being CHF 247 million for resourcing flexibility in the Pharmaceuticals
Division, including global field force reductions, notably in the US and Europe. The remaining CHF 85 million includes plans for
the outsourcing of IT and other functions to shared service centres and external providers.
In 2016 total costs were CHF 197 million, with the major items being CHF 74 million from the Pharmaceuticals Division research and
development strategic realignment and CHF 90 million in informatics mainly for the outsourcing of IT functions to shared service centres
and external providers. The remaining minor plans totalled CHF 33 million.

• A charge of CHF 674 million in the Diagnostics Division for the full write-off of the sequencing business goodwill. The factors leading
to this impairment were: (i) a decrease in forecasted cash flows relative to the previous year’s long-term forecast due to changed
assumptions around market penetration, pricing and reimbursement; and (ii) a revised time to market of the single molecule sequencing
technology. In addition impairment charges of CHF 120 million were recorded for sequencing business product intangibles in use
acquired as part of the Ariosa acquisition (see Note 9).
• A charge of CHF 384 million in the Pharmaceuticals Division for the full write-off of the goodwill relating to the Seragon acquisition due
to the decision to stop development of the back-up compound acquired.
Impairment charge – 2016
During 2016, a goodwill impairment charge of CHF 95 million was recorded in the Pharmaceuticals Division for the full write-off of
goodwill from the Anadys Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition in 2011 which is deemed to have been disposed of.

Pharmaceuticals. The recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal.
For Chugai and Foundation Medicine the fair value less costs of disposal is determined with reference to the publicly quoted share
prices of Chugai and Foundation Medicine shares.
Diagnostics Division. The division’s business areas are the cash-generating units used for the testing of goodwill. The goodwill arising
from the Corange/Boehringer Mannheim acquisition and part of the goodwill from the Ventana acquisition is recorded and monitored
at a divisional level as it relates to the strategic development of the whole division and cannot be meaningfully allocated to the division’s
business areas. Therefore the cash-generating unit for this goodwill is the entire division. The goodwill arising from the Viewics
acquisition is monitored at the divisional level. The recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is based on value in use.
Value in use. This is calculated using a discounted expected cash flow approach, with a post-tax discount rate applied to the projected
risk-adjusted post-tax cash flows and terminal value. The discount rate is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital as the cash-
generating units have integrated operations across large parts of the Group. It is derived from a capital asset pricing model using data
from capital markets, including government twenty-year bonds. For assessing value in use, the cash flow projections are based on the
most recent long-term forecasts approved by management. The long-term forecasts include management’s latest estimates on sales
volume and pricing, as well as production and other operating costs and assume no significant changes in the organisation. Other key
assumptions used in the calculations are the period of cash flow projections included in the long-term forecasts, the terminal value
growth rate and the discount rate.

– Other Diagnostics businesses 5 years 1.5% 6.8% 5 years 1.5% 6.5%
For cash-generating units with a terminal value growth, the respective rate does not exceed the long-term projected growth rate for
the relevant market. The ten years period of cash flow projections reflects the long-term nature of the development of the sequencing
business.
Sensitivity analysis
Management has performed sensitivity analyses for Roche Pharmaceuticals and the Diagnostics Division, which increased the discount
rate by 1% combined with decreasing the forecast cash flows by 5%, and for Chugai and Foundation Medicine, which decreased the
publicly quoted share prices by 5%. The results of the sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the above changes in the key assumptions
would not cause the carrying values of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amounts at 31 December 2017.

Internally generated intangible assets
The Group currently has no internally generated intangible assets from development as the criteria for the recognition as an asset are
not met.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
The Group currently has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Intangible assets not available for use
These mostly represent in-process research and development assets acquired either through in-licensing arrangements, business
combinations or separate purchases. At 31 December 2017 approximately 68% (2016: 70%) of the projects in the Pharmaceuticals
Division have known decision points within the next twelve months which in certain circumstances could lead to impairment. Due to
the inherent uncertainties in the research and development processes, intangible assets not available for use are particularly at risk
of impairment if the project is not expected to result in a commercialised product.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 67Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Intangible asset impairment
Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
eventual disposal. Factors such as the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence or lower-than-anticipated sales for
products with capitalised rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.
Impairment charges – 2017
Pharmaceuticals Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 2,188 million were recorded which related to:
• A charge of CHF 1,664 million for the partial impairment of the Esbriet product intangible in use acquired as part of the InterMune
acquisition. The asset concerned was written down to its estimated recoverable value of CHF 2,878 million. The main factor leading to
this was a decrease in forecasted cash flows relative to the previous year’s long-term forecast due to a reduction in sales expectations.
The intangible asset continues to be amortised over its remaining estimated useful life of four years.
• A charge of CHF 195 million due to the launch of a competitor product for the compound acquired as part of the Trophos acquisition.
The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was written down to its estimated recoverable value of CHF 101 million.
• A charge of CHF 149 million due to the decision to stop development of one compound with an alliance partner following an
assessment of clinical and non-clinical data. The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 74 million due to the decision to stop development of one compound acquired as part of the Dutalys acquisition.
The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 47 million due to the decision to stop development of one compound acquired as part of the Santaris acquisition
following a clinical data assessment. The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 39 million due to the decision to stop development of two compounds with two different alliance partners. The assets
concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully written down.
• A charge of CHF 20 million following clinical data assessments. The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully
written down.
Diagnostics Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 272 million were recorded which related to:
• A charge of CHF 152 million for the partial impairment of Molecular Diagnostics product intangibles not available for use acquired
as part of the GeneWeave acquisition. The factor leading to this partial impairment was a decrease in forecasted cash flows following
a change in the timelines for future product development, pricing and penetration rate due to updated market size assumptions.
The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was written down to its estimated recoverable value of CHF 268 million.
• A charge of CHF 120 million for the partial impairment of sequencing business product intangibles in use acquired as part of the Ariosa
acquisition. The factor leading to this impairment was a decrease in forecasted cash flows following revised assumptions on pricing
and penetration rate due to market dynamics. The asset concerned, which was being amortised, was written down to its estimated
recoverable value of CHF 312 million.
Impairment charges – 2016
Pharmaceuticals Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 1,343 million were recorded which related to:
• A decision to stop development of one compound acquired as part of the Seragon acquisition following a clinical data assessment
(CHF 885 million). The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
• A delay in the development of the compound acquired as part of the Trophos acquisition following regulatory feedback
(CHF 187 million). The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was written down to its estimated recoverable value of
CHF 301 million.
• A portfolio reassessment of one compound (CHF 162 million). The asset concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully
written down.
• A clinical data assessment of two development projects with two different alliance partners (CHF 67 million). The assets concerned,
which were not yet being amortised, were fully written down.
• A decision to stop development of three compounds (CHF 42 million). The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised,
were fully written down.
Diagnostics Division. Impairment charges totalling CHF 70 million were recorded which related to:
• Sequencing product intangibles in use (CHF 63 million) as a result of a decision to stop the product development, commercialisation
and licence agreement with an alliance partner. The asset concerned, which was being amortised, was fully written down.
• Tissue Diagnostics product intangibles in use (CHF 7 million) as a result of a strategic portfolio reassessment. The asset concerned,
which was being amortised, was fully written down.

Potential commitments from alliance collaborations and purchase agreements within the next three years
The Group is party to in-licensing and similar arrangements with its alliance partners and intangible asset purchase agreements from
third parties. These arrangements and purchase agreements may require the Group to make certain milestone or other similar payments
dependent upon the achievement of agreed objectives or performance targets as defined in the collaboration and purchase agreements.
The Group’s current estimate of future third-party commitments for such payments within the next three years is set out in the table below.
These figures are undiscounted and are not risk-adjusted, meaning that they include all such potential payments that can arise assuming
all projects currently in development are successful. The timing is based on the Group’s current best estimate. These figures do not
include any potential commitments within the Group, such as may arise between the Roche and Chugai businesses.

The Group has revised the presentation of provisions. Contingent consideration provisions are now presented separately and employee provisions are now included as part of
‘Other provisions’. The comparative period information has been restated accordingly.
In 2017 CHF 772 million of provisions were utilised (2016: CHF 836 million), of which CHF 621 million (2016: CHF 762 million) are included
in the cash flows from operating activities and CHF 151 million (2016: CHF 74 million) are included in the cash flows from business
combinations for payments made from deferred and contingent consideration arrangements (see Note 5).
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 73Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Legal provisions
Legal provisions consist of a number of separate legal matters, including claims arising from trade, in various Group companies.
By their nature the amounts and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict.
As part of the regular review of litigation matters, management has reassessed the provisions recorded for certain litigation matters.
Based on the development of the various litigations, notably the Accutane case, some of the provisions previously held were released,
resulting in income of CHF 219 million in 2017. This was a major element in the 2017 legal expenses, which show a net income of
CHF 142 million (2016: net expense of CHF 39 million). Details of the major legal cases outstanding are disclosed below.
Environmental provisions
Provisions for environmental matters include various separate environmental issues in a number of countries. By their nature the amounts
and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict. Significant provisions are discounted by between 2% and 4% where the time value
of money is material. The significant provisions relate to the US site in Nutley, New Jersey, which was divested in September 2016,
the estimated remediation costs for a landfill site near Grenzach, Germany, that was used by manufacturing operations that were closed
some years ago and the estimated remediation costs for the manufacturing site at Clarecastle, Ireland. In 2017 the expected costs
of environmental remediation at the Clarecastle site were reassessed and accordingly the environmental provisions were increased
by CHF 46 million. This was a major element in the 2017 environmental expenses, which show a net expense of CHF 62 million
(2016: net expense of CHF 38 million).
The Group’s procedures on environmental protection are included in the Annual Report on pages 74 to 85. These include the actions
taken by the Group with regard to climate change, notably the Group’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Restructuring provisions
These arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of business undertaken by the Group or the manner in which
business is conducted. Such provisions include only the costs necessarily entailed by the restructuring which are not associated with
the recurring activities of the Group. The timings of these cash outflows are reasonably certain. These provisions are not discounted as
the time value of money is not material in these matters.
In the Pharmaceuticals Division the significant provisions relate to the strategic realignment of the manufacturing network including
exiting from four manufacturing sites, the resourcing flexibility plans to address various future challenges including biosimilar competition,
the research and development strategic alignment and the outsourcing of IT functions to shared service centres and external providers
(see Note 6).
Contingent consideration provisions
The Group is party to certain contingent consideration arrangements arising from business combinations. Significant provisions are
discounted using an average discount rate of 3.1% (2016: 3.2%) where the time value of money is material. Additional details on
measurement, on main movements of the provisions and on the total potential payments under these arrangements are provided in Note 29.
74 | Roche Finance Report 2017Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Other provisions
Other provisions relate to the items shown in the table below. With the exception of employee provisions, the timing of cash outflows is
by its nature uncertain.

Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees, to be affected by political, legislative, fiscal
and regulatory developments, including those relating to environmental protection, in the countries in which it operates. The industries
in which the Group operates are also subject to other risks of various kinds. The nature and frequency of these developments and events,
not all of which are covered by insurance, as well as their effect on future operations and earnings, are not predictable.
The Group has entered into strategic alliances with various companies in order to gain access to potential new products or to utilise other
companies to help develop the Group’s own potential new products. Potential future payments may become due to certain collaboration
partners achieving certain milestones as defined in the collaboration agreements. The Group’s best estimates of future commitments for
such payments are given in Note 9.
Pharmaceuticals legal cases
At 31 December 2017 provisions for legal cases in the Pharmaceuticals Division were CHF 369 million (2016: CHF 592 million). Provisions
have been recorded, and in some cases settled, mainly relating to the matters listed below.
Accutane. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (‘HLR’) and various other Roche affiliates have been named as defendants in numerous legal
actions in the US and elsewhere relating to the acne medication Accutane. The litigation alleges that Accutane caused certain serious
conditions, including, but not limited to, inflammatory bowel disease (‘IBD’), birth defects and psychiatric disorders. In 2009 HLR
announced that, following a re-evaluation of its portfolio of medicines that are now available from generic manufacturers, rapidly
declining brand sales in the US and high costs from personal-injury lawsuits that it continues to defend vigorously, it had decided to
immediately discontinue the manufacture and distribution of the product in the US.
All of the actions pending in federal court alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation (‘MDL’)
in the US District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division. In August 2015 the MDL was closed. During the pendency of
the MDL the District Court granted summary judgment in favour of HLR for all of the federal IBD cases that had proceeded and all were
affirmed by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. All of the actions pending in state court in New Jersey alleging IBD were
consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County.
At 31 December 2016 there was one case on appeal (USD 25 million) where a jury in the New Jersey Superior Court had ruled in favour
of the plaintiff and subsequently had its verdict reversed in favour of HLR. In January 2017 the New Jersey Supreme Court reinstated the
case and remanded it to the Appellate Division for consideration of other issues. In May 2017 the Appellate Division again ruled in favour
of HLR, reversed the verdict and remanded for a new trial. The plaintiff filed a petition for review to the Supreme Court, which remains
pending.
In February 2015 the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County, held an eight-day evidentiary hearing on whether
plaintiffs’ experts can testify that Accutane causes Crohn’s disease. On 20 February 2015 the Superior Court barred plaintiffs’ experts
because their methods did not meet the requirements for scientific reliability. On 8 May 2015 the Superior Court entered an order
dismissing with prejudice an agreed-upon list of 2,076 Crohn’s disease cases that were subject to the Superior Court’s February 2015
order. On 28 July 2017 the New Jersey Appellate Division reversed the order excluding plaintiff’s experts from testifying that Accutane
causes Crohn’s disease and reinstated the dismissed cases finding that the trial court wrongfully barred plaintiffs’ expert witnesses. HLR
filed a petition for review to the New Jersey Supreme Court, which was granted on 8 December 2017. Oral argument is expected in 2018.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 75Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
On 12 May 2015 the Superior Court entered an order granting summary judgment and dismissing 18 cases filed by New Jersey residents
on the basis that the drug label was adequate as a matter of law since 2002. In July 2015 the Superior Court granted HLR’s motion
for summary judgment as to the adequacy of the label for post-2002 ingestion cases in 44 other jurisdictions. The Superior Court applied
New Jersey law to all of the jurisdictions and granted HLR’s motion dismissing approximately 511 cases. In the alternative, the Superior
Court applied the home state law and granted summary judgment in 24 jurisdictions and denied it in 20 jurisdictions; this would have
resulted in 389 cases being dismissed. On 25 July 2017 the New Jersey Appellate Division affirmed the dismissal of 197 cases and
reinstated judgments in 335 cases based on the strength of HLR’s warnings after 2002. HLR and the dismissed plaintiffs filed petitions
for review to the New Jersey Supreme Court, which was granted on 8 December 2017. Oral argument is expected in 2018.
In January and October 2016 the Superior Court entered orders granting summary judgment and dismissing 191 cases for failure to prove
Accutane proximately caused their ulcerative colitis. The plaintiffs have appealed all of these decisions. During February and March 2017
the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County, held an evidentiary hearing on whether plaintiffs’ experts can testify
that Accutane causes ulcerative colitis. In April 2017 the Superior Court barred plaintiffs’ experts because their methods did not meet
the requirements for scientific reliability. In May 2017 the Superior Court entered an order dismissing 3,231 ulcerative colitis cases
that were subject to the Superior Court’s April 2017 order. The plaintiffs have appealed these decisions.
At 31 December 2017 HLR was defending approximately 2,500 actions involving approximately 2,500 plaintiffs brought in various
state courts throughout the US for personal injuries allegedly resulting from their use of Accutane. There are approximately 3,619 cases
on appeal. If any cases survive the appeals, additional trials may be scheduled. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors,
including many that are unique to the particular case and therefore the trial results to date may not be predictive of future trial results.
The Group continues to defend vigorously the remaining personal injury cases and claims. Based on the development of the litigation
some of the provisions previously held were released in 2017.
Avastin/Lucentis investigations. On 14 February 2013 the Italian Antitrust Authority (‘AGCM’) announced an investigation to determine
whether Roche, Genentech and Novartis had entered into an agreement to restrict competition in the Italian market for drugs, with
reference in particular to Avastin (marketed by Roche) and Lucentis (marketed by Novartis). Avastin and Lucentis are two different
drugs that were developed and approved for different therapeutic purposes and contain different active pharmaceutical ingredients.
On 5 March 2014 the AGCM issued a verdict that alleges that Roche and Novartis colluded to artificially differentiate Avastin and
Lucentis in order to foster the sales of Lucentis in Italy. The AGCM fined Roche EUR 90.5 million and Novartis EUR 92 million. Roche
appealed the AGCM verdict to the Tribunale Amministrativo Regionale del Lazio (‘TAR’). On 2 December 2014 the TAR upheld the
decision by the AGCM. Roche strongly disagrees with the verdict of the TAR and has appealed to the Consiglio di Stato. On 30 May 2014
the Italian Ministry of Health notified Roche S.p.A. of its intention to seek damages related to this matter. In July 2014 Roche paid the
EUR 90.5 million fine under protest to avoid additional penalty fees and recorded an expense within general and administration. The fine
and related interest will be reimbursed if Roche wins the case. On 23 January 2018 the European Court of Justice rendered its decision
on five questions which were referred to the European Court of Justice by the Consiglio di Stato. The principles defined in this decision will
be used by the Consiglio di Stato to render their final verdict on the case. The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
PDL-1 inhibitor litigation. On 26 July 2017 Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (‘BMS’) filed a lawsuit against Genentech in Delaware. BMS alleges
that Genentech’s sale of Tecentriq infringes their US Patent No. 9,402,899. BMS is seeking judgment in its favour, a finding of wilfulness
and monetary damages. On 4 October 2017 Genentech filed its answer and counterclaims, seeking a declaratory judgment of invalidity
of the 9,402,899 patent. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Average Wholesale Prices litigation. HLR and Roche Laboratories Inc. (‘RLI’), along with approximately 50 other brand and generic
pharmaceutical companies, have been named as defendants in several legal actions in the US relating to the pricing of pharmaceutical
drugs and State Medicaid reimbursement. The primary allegation in these litigations is that the pharmaceutical companies misrepresented
or otherwise reported inaccurate Average Wholesale Prices (‘AWP’) and/or Wholesale Acquisition Costs (‘WAC’) for their drugs, which
prices were allegedly relied upon by the States in calculating Medicaid reimbursements to entities such as retail pharmacies. The states,
through their respective Attorney General, are seeking repayment of the amounts they claim were over-reimbursed. The time period
associated with these cases is 1991 through 2005. At 31 December 2017 HLR and RLI are defending one AWP action filed in the state
of New Jersey. HLR and RLI are vigorously defending themselves and no trial date has been set. The outcome of this matter cannot
be determined at this time.
Rituxan arbitration. In October 2008 Genentech and Biogen Idec Inc. filed a complaint in California against Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland
GmbH, Sanofi-Aventis US LLC and Sanofi-Aventis US Inc. (‘Sanofi’) seeking a declaratory judgment that certain Genentech products,
including Rituxan, do not infringe Sanofi’s US Patent Nos. 5,849,522 and 6,218,140 and that the ‘522 and ‘140 patents are invalid. Sanofi
alleged that Rituxan and another Genentech product infringe certain claims of the ‘522 and ‘140 patents. In March 2011 the district court
ruled as a matter of law that Genentech and Biogen Idec do not infringe the asserted patent claims. In May 2011 Sanofi appealed the
court’s non-infringement ruling. The appellate court affirmed the district court’s judgment of no patent infringement.
76 | Roche Finance Report 2017Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
In addition, in October 2008 Sanofi affiliate Hoechst GmbH (‘Hoechst’) filed with the ICC International Court of Arbitration (Paris)
a request for arbitration with Genentech, relating to a terminated patent-licence agreement between one of Hoechst’s predecessors
and Genentech that pertained to the above-mentioned patents and related patents outside the US. Hoechst sought payment of patent-
licence royalties on sales of certain Genentech products, including Rituxan, damages for breach of contract, and other relief. In various
arbitral awards in September 2012 and February 2013, the arbitrator found Genentech liable to Hoechst for patent-licence royalties on
Rituxan, and he awarded the royalties and interest that Hoechst had sought. In February 2013 the Group recorded a back royalty expense
of CHF 42 million, net of the assumed reimbursement of a portion of the Group’s obligation by its co-promotion partner in the US.
Hoechst initiated proceedings in the US, France and Germany seeking to enforce the arbitral awards. In October 2013 Genentech paid
the awarded royalties and interest to Hoechst under protest. Genentech is seeking annulment of the arbitral awards through proceedings
it initiated in the Court of Appeal of Paris. There was a hearing in those proceedings in June 2014. In September 2014 the Paris Court
of Appeal stayed the annulment proceedings to seek guidance from the EU Court of Justice on a specific legal question that had been
raised by Genentech relating to the arbitral award’s non-compliance under EU competition laws. In November 2014 Hoechst filed notices
of appeal to the French Supreme Court seeking to review the Paris Court of Appeal’s decision to seek guidance from the EU Court of
Justice. On 18 November 2015 the French Supreme Court denied Hoechst’s challenge to the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal to
refer the specific legal question to the EU Court of Justice. On 7 July 2016 the EU Court of Justice issued its opinion in the case, finding
that where a licensee may freely terminate a licence, the licence is not anti-competitive. On 26 September 2017 the Paris Court of Appeal
issued a decision dismissing the appeal and ruling in favour of Hoechst. It is expected that the matter will be finally concluded in the
first quarter of 2018.
In addition, the matters listed below do not currently have provisions recorded, but there are potential future obligations which will
be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events or where the obligation cannot be measured with
sufficient reliability.
Boniva litigation. HLR, Genentech and various other Roche affiliates (collectively ‘Roche’) have been named as defendants in
numerous legal actions in the US and one now dismissed case in Canada relating to the post-menopausal osteoporosis medication
Boniva. In these litigations, the plaintiffs allege that Boniva caused either osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypical femoral fractures.
At 31 December 2017 Roche is defending approximately 284 actions involving approximately 329 plaintiffs brought in federal and state
courts throughout the US for personal injuries allegedly resulting from the use of Boniva. All of these cases are in the early discovery
stages of litigation. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including many that are unique to the particular case. Roche is
vigorously defending itself in these matters. The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
EMA investigation. On 23 October 2012 the European Medicines Agency (‘EMA’) announced that it would start an infringement
procedure to investigate allegations regarding an alleged breach of medicines safety reporting obligations in relation to 19 centrally
authorised medicines. On 19 November 2013 the EMA announced the results of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee
assessment of Roche’s medicines. The EMA found no impact regarding the benefit-risk balance of any of Roche’s medicines and
confirmed the benefit-risk profiles based on available safety information. The EMA and other health authorities have confirmed all
medicines remain authorised without changes to the treatment advice for patients and healthcare professionals. All corrective and
preventative actions resulting from the inspections were implemented. A re-inspection by authorities in November 2013 led to certain
findings which Roche addressed accordingly. On 14 April 2014 the EMA issued its report to the European Commission that summarises
the EMA’s findings in relation to the investigation. On 6 July 2015 the European Commission issued a notification to the EMA, returning
the case file to the EMA for a new period of inquiry. On 4 July 2016 the EMA announced that it had concluded its second inquiry and
sent, on 1 July 2016, the final updated report to the European Commission. On 15 December 2017 the European Commission announced
that it has closed the infringement procedure without imposing any penalty. The matter is now concluded.
Hemlibra (emicizumab) litigation. On 4 May 2017 Baxalta Inc. (‘Baxalta’), a subsidiary of Shire plc., filed a patent infringement
and declaratory judgment of patent infringement suit in the US District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that Genentech, Inc.
and Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. currently or imminently would manufacture, use, sell, offer for sale, or import into the US Hemlibra
(emicizumab), which would infringe Baxalta’s US Patent No. 7,033,590. Baxalta is seeking a judgment of infringement, injunctive and
monetary relief, attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses. On 11 May 2017 Genentech was served with the complaint. Genentech’s response
and counterclaims to the complaint were filed on 30 June 2017. On 19 June 2017 Chugai waived service. On 13 September 2017 Chugai
filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. On 16 November 2017 the Food and Drug Administration (‘FDA’)
approved Hemlibra (emicizumab) for haemophilia A with inhibitors for use in the US. On 14 December 2017 Baxalta filed a motion for
a preliminary injunction seeking to prevent Genentech from marketing or selling Hemlibra to patients in the US, but excluding inhibitor
patients who are already being treated with it and excluding inhibitor patients who are less well served by existing bypass treatments
or cannot receive prophylactic bypass treatments. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 77Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Securities litigation. On 6 June 2017 a class action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
against Roche Holding Ltd and two of its current officers. The lawsuit brings claims under the federal securities laws in connection
with the Group’s public disclosures, in particular with respect to matters relating to two of Roche’s drugs, Herceptin and Perjeta.
Other substantially similar lawsuits may follow. The Group will vigorously defend itself in this matter. The outcome of this matter cannot
be determined at this time.
Arbitration against Chugai. In May 2017 Medical Research Council and LifeArc (formerly Medical Research Council Technology)
(‘Claimants’) requested arbitration against Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. with an arbitrator being appointed on 9 August 2017.
Sums are sought from Chugai for alleged breach of obligations under a collaboration agreement dated 15 August 1990 in connection
with the development of the humanised anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, Actemra. It is claimed that Chugai is obliged
to pay royalties to the Claimants pursuant to the collaboration agreement. Chugai considers that the claims are without merit and
Chugai will vigorously defend itself in the arbitration. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Redemption and repurchase of bonds and notes – 2017
Redemption of Swiss franc bonds. On the due date of 23 March 2017 the Group redeemed the 4.5% fixed rate bonds with a principal
amount of CHF 1.5 billion. The cash outflow was CHF 1,500 million, plus accrued interest. The effective interest rate of these bonds
was 4.77%.
Redemption of US dollar notes. On the due date of 29 September 2017 the Group redeemed the 1.35% fixed rate notes with a principal

Redemption and repurchase of bonds and notes – 2016
Redemption of US dollar notes. On 30 December 2015 the Group resolved to exercise its option to call for early partial redemption of
the 6.0% fixed rate notes due 1 March 2019. On 24 March 2016 the Group redeemed an outstanding principal of USD 600 million at an
amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of these notes discounted to the redemption date
at the US Treasury rate plus 0.50%, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal. The cash outflow was CHF 660 million,
plus accrued interest. At 31 December 2015 the Group revised the carrying value of these notes to take into account the changes to
the amounts and timings of the estimated cash flows which resulted in an increase in carrying value of USD 74 million (CHF 72 million)
which was recorded within financing costs as a loss on redemption in 2015. In 2016 there was an additional CHF 4 million loss recorded
on redemption. The effective interest rate of these notes was 6.37%.
On 22 June 2016 the Group resolved to exercise its option to call for early partial redemption of the 6.0% fixed rate notes due 1 March 2019.
On 25 August 2016 the Group redeemed an outstanding principal of USD 857 million at an amount equal to the sum of the present values
of the remaining scheduled payments of these notes discounted to the redemption date at the US Treasury rate plus 0.50%, together
with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal. The cash outflow was CHF 924 million, plus accrued interest and there was a loss on
redemption of CHF 99 million. The effective interest rate of these notes was 6.37%.
On 19 December 2016 the Group completed a tender offer to repurchase USD 80 million of the 7.0% fixed rate notes due 1 March 2039.
The cash outflow was CHF 118 million, plus accrued interest and there was a loss on repurchase of CHF 39 million. The effective interest
rate of these notes was 7.43%.
Redemption of euro notes. On the due date of 4 March 2016 the Group redeemed the 5.625% fixed rate notes with a principal of
EUR 2.1 billion. The cash outflow was CHF 2,283 million, plus accrued interest. The effective interest rate of these notes was 5.70%.

Genentech transaction
The Group completed the purchase of the non-controlling interests in Genentech effective 26 March 2009. Based on the International
Accounting Standard 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ (IAS 27) and consistent with the International Financial Reporting Standard 10
‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ (IFRS 10), which was adopted by the Group in 2013, this transaction was accounted for in full
as an equity transaction. As a consequence, the carrying amount of the consolidated equity of the Group at that time was reduced by
CHF 52.2 billion, of which CHF 8.5 billion was allocated to eliminate the book value of Genentech non-controlling interests. This
accounting effect significantly impacted the Group’s net equity, but has no effect on the Group’s business or its dividend policy.

Share capital
At 31 December 2017 the authorised and issued share capital of Roche Holding Ltd, which is the Group’s parent company, consisted
of 160 million shares with a nominal value of CHF 1.00 each, as in the preceding year. The shares are bearer shares and the Group
does not maintain a register of shareholders. Based on information supplied to the Group, a shareholder group with pooled voting rights
owns 45.01% (2016: 45.01%) of the issued shares. On 24 March 2011 the shareholder group announced that it would continue the
shareholder pooling agreement existing since 1948 with a modified shareholder composition. The shareholder group with pooled voting
rights now holds 72,018,000 shares, corresponding to 45.01% of the shares issued. This figure does not include any shares without
pooled voting rights that are held outside this group by individual members of the group. Ms Maja Oeri, formerly a member of the pool,
now holds 8,091,900 shares representing 5.057% of the voting rights independently of the pool. This is further described in Note 30.
Based on information supplied to the Group, Novartis Holding AG, Basel, owns 33.333% (participation below 331⁄3%) of the issued shares
(2016: 33.333%).
Non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
At 31 December 2017 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities have been authorised and were in issue as in the preceding year. Under
Swiss company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value, are not part of the share capital and cannot be issued
against a contribution which would be shown as an asset in the balance sheet of Roche Holding Ltd. Each non-voting equity security
confers the same rights as any of the shares to participate in the net profit and any remaining proceeds from liquidation following
repayment of the nominal value of the shares and, if any, participation certificates. In accordance with the law and the Articles of
Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd, the Company is entitled at all times to exchange all or some of the non-voting equity securities
into shares or participation certificates.
Dividends
On 14 March 2017 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of CHF 8.20 per share and non-voting equity security
(2016: CHF 8.10) in respect of the 2016 business year. The distribution to holders of outstanding shares and non-voting equity securities
totalled CHF 6,998 million (2016: CHF 6,909 million) and has been recorded against retained earnings in 2017. The Board of Directors
has proposed dividends for the 2017 business year of CHF 8.30 per share and non-voting equity security which, if approved, would result
in a total distribution to shareholders of CHF 7,159 million. This is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 13 March 2018.

22. Subsidiaries and associates
Chugai
Effective 1 October 2002 the Roche Group and Chugai completed an alliance to create a leading research-driven Japanese
pharmaceutical company, which was formed by the merger of Chugai and Roche’s Japanese pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Nippon Roche.
The merged company is known as Chugai.
Consolidated subsidiary. Chugai is a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group. This is based on the Group’s interest in Chugai
at 31 December 2017 of 61.3% (2016: 61.4%) and the Roche relationship with Chugai that is founded on the Basic Alliance, Licensing
and Research Collaboration Agreements.
The common stock of Chugai is publicly traded and is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange under the stock code ‘TSE:4519’. Chugai
prepares financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that are filed on a quarterly basis
with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to certain consolidation entries there are minor differences between Chugai’s stand-alone IFRS
results and the results of Chugai as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS.

Dividends. The dividends distributed to third parties holding Chugai shares during 2017 totalled CHF 102 million (2016: CHF 110 million)
and have been recorded against non-controlling interests (see Note 23). Dividends paid by Chugai to Roche are eliminated on
consolidation as intercompany items.
Roche’s relationship with Chugai. Chugai has entered into certain agreements with Roche, which are discussed below:
(1) Basic Alliance Agreement – As part of the Basic Alliance Agreement signed in December 2001, Roche and Chugai entered into
certain arrangements covering the future operation and governance of Chugai. Amongst other matters these cover the following areas:
• The structuring of the alliance.
• Roche’s rights as a shareholder.
• Roche’s rights to nominate members of Chugai’s Board of Directors.
• Certain limitations to Roche’s ability to buy or sell Chugai’s common stock.
Chugai issues additional shares of common stock in connection with its convertible debt and equity compensation plans, and may issue
additional shares for other purposes, which affects Roche’s percentage ownership interest. The Basic Alliance Agreement provides,
amongst other matters, that Chugai will guarantee Roche’s right to maintain its shareholding percentage in Chugai at not less than 50.1%.
86 | Roche Finance Report 2017Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
(2) Licensing Agreements – Under the Japan Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in December 2001, Chugai has exclusive rights to
market Roche’s pharmaceutical products in Japan. Chugai also has the right of first refusal on the development and marketing in Japan
of all development compounds advanced by Roche.
The Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement (excluding Japan and South Korea) signed in May 2002 was revised and the Amended
and Restated Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement (excluding Japan, South Korea and Taiwan) was signed in August 2014.
Under this Agreement Roche has the right of first refusal on the development and marketing of Chugai’s development compounds in
markets outside Japan, excluding South Korea and Taiwan.
Further to these agreements, Roche and Chugai have signed a series of separate agreements for certain specific products. Depending
on the specific circumstances and the terms of the agreement, this may result in payments on an arm’s length basis between Roche and
Chugai, for any or all of the following matters:
• Upfront payments, if a right of first refusal to license a product is exercised.
• Milestone payments, dependent upon the achievement of agreed performance targets.
• Royalties on future product sales.
These specific product agreements may also cover the manufacture and supply of the respective products to meet the other party’s
clinical and/or commercial requirements on an arm’s length basis.
(3) Research Collaboration Agreements – Roche and Chugai have entered into research collaboration agreements in the areas of small-
molecule synthetic drug research and biotechnology-based drug discovery.
Foundation Medicine
On 7 April 2015 the Group acquired a controlling interest in Foundation Medicine, Inc. (‘FMI’), a publicly owned US company based
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and entered into an Investor Rights Agreement, a Research and Development Collaboration Agreement
and several Commercial Collaboration Agreements.
FMI is a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group. This is based on the Group’s interest in FMI at 31 December 2017 of 57.5%
(2016: 59.6%) and the Roche relationship with FMI that is founded on the above agreements. The common stock of FMI is publicly traded
and is listed on the Nasdaq under the stock code ‘FMI’. FMI prepares financial statements in accordance with US GAAP that are filed
on a quarterly basis with the SEC. Due to certain consolidation entries there are differences between FMI’s stand-alone US GAAP results
and the results of FMI as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance with IFRS.
Dividends. There were no dividends distributed to third parties holding FMI shares during 2017 and 2016.
Associates
On 1 June 2017 the Group acquired an interest in Senseonics Holding, Inc. (‘Senseonics’), a publicly owned US company based in
Germantown, Maryland, which resulted in the Group having a 23.0% interest in Senseonics. This investment has been assessed and is
treated as an associate of the Group. The Group’s interest in Senseonics at 31 December 2017 was 20.7%. The common stock of Senseonics
is publicly traded and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE-MKT) under the stock code ‘SENS’. Senseonics prepares financial
statements in accordance with US GAAP that are filed on a quarterly basis with the SEC. The Group accounts for Senseonics using the
equity method based on Senseonics’ financial statements that are publicly available. The Group’s share of Senseonics’ results, a loss of
CHF 2 million, is included in other financial income (expenses) (see Note 3) and the carrying value of the Group’s share of Senseonics’ net
assets at 31 December 2017, an asset of CHF 36 million, is included in other non-current assets (see Note 14).
Divestment of subsidiaries
On 1 February 2017 the Group sold its wholly owned subsidiary Roche Carolina Inc. in Florence, US, to a third party as part of the
previously announced Pharmaceuticals Division’s strategic realignment of its manufacturing network. The total consideration received
was USD 8 million in cash. A total loss on divestment of CHF 95 million was reported as global restructuring costs in the Roche
Pharmaceuticals operating segment and included in general and administration.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 87Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
On 1 September 2017 the Group sold its wholly owned subsidiary at the Segrate site, Italy, to a third party as part of the previously
announced Pharmaceuticals Division’s strategic realignment of its manufacturing network. The total consideration was EUR 9 million of
which EUR 2 million were received in 2017 and the remaining EUR 7 million will be received in 2018 and 2019. A total loss on divestment
of CHF 31 million was reported as global restructuring costs in the Roche Pharmaceuticals operating segment and included in general

25. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
The Group’s objective is to provide attractive and competitive post-employment benefits to employees, while at the same time ensuring
that the various plans are appropriately financed and managing any potential impacts on the Group’s long-term financial position. Most
employees are covered by pension plans sponsored by Group companies. The nature of such plans varies according to legal regulations,
fiscal requirements and market practice in the countries in which the employees are employed. Post-employment benefit plans are
classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund or to a third-party financial
institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions. All other plans are classified as ‘defined
benefit plans’.
Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans are funded through payments by employees and by the Group to funds administered by third parties.
The Group’s expenses for these plans were CHF 482 million (2016: CHF 473 million). No assets or liabilities are recognised in the Group’s
balance sheet in respect of such plans, apart from regular prepayments and accruals of the contributions withheld from employees’
wages and salaries and of the Group’s contributions. The Group’s major defined contribution plan is the US Roche 401(k) Savings Plan.
Defined benefit plans
Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by payments from Group companies and by employees.
In some cases, notably for the major defined benefit plans in Germany, the plans are unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired
employees directly from its own financial resources. Plans are usually governed by a senior governing body, such as a Board of Trustees,
which is typically composed of both employee and employer representatives. Funding of these plans is determined by local regulations
using independent actuarial valuations. Separate independent actuarial valuations are prepared in accordance with the requirements
of IAS 19 for use in the Group’s financial statements. The Group’s major pension plans are located in Switzerland, the US and Germany,
which in total account for 82% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation (2016: 81%).
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 89Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Pension plans in Switzerland. Current pension arrangements for employees in Switzerland are made through plans governed by
the Swiss Federal Occupational Old Age, Survivors and Disability Pension Act (‘BVG’). The Group’s pension plans are administered by
separate legal foundations, which are funded by regular employee and company contributions. The final benefit is contribution-based
with certain minimum guarantees. Due to these minimum guarantees, the Swiss plans are treated as defined benefit plans for the
purposes of these IFRS financial statements, although they have many of the characteristics of defined contribution plans. Where there
is an under-funding, this may be remedied by various measures such as increasing employee and company contributions, lowering
the interest rate on retirement account balances, reducing prospective benefits and a suspension of the early withdrawal facility.
In 2016 operating income of CHF 426 million was recorded for past service costs from changes to the Group’s pension plans in
Switzerland that were announced in June 2016. This represents the impact of the adjustment of the pension liability for plan changes. Of
this amount, CHF 310 million was recorded in the Pharmaceuticals Division, CHF 77 million in the Diagnostics Division and CHF 39 million
in Corporate. The past service income was recorded within general and administration. As part of the adjustments to the pension plans
in Switzerland, the Group made payments of CHF 165 million to the pension funds.
Pension plans in the US. The Group’s major defined benefit plans in the US have been closed to new members since 2007. New employees
in the US now join the defined contribution plan. The largest of the remaining defined benefit plans are funded pension plans together
with smaller unfunded supplementary retirement plans. The benefits are based on the highest average annual rate of earnings during
a specified period and length of employment. The plans are non-contributory for employees, with the Group making periodic payments
to the plans. Where there is an under-funding, this would normally be remedied by additional company contributions. In 2017 payments
made by the Group were USD 80 million (2016: USD 233 million). The decrease in payments compared to 2016 is due to additional
contributions made in 2016 to benefit from a lower insurance fee to Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, a US government agency
overseeing occupational pension schemes in the US. In 2017 the Group entered into an annuity buyout agreement with an insurance
company and paid USD 330 million from plan assets to settle the defined benefit obligation for some retired employees. This led to
a settlement loss of USD 10 million in 2017.
Pension plans in Germany. The Group’s major pension arrangements in Germany are governed by the Occupational Pensions Act
(‘BetrAVG’). These plans are unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources.
These plans are non-contributory for employees. The benefits are based on final salary and length of employment. These plans have
been closed to new members since 2007. They have been replaced by a new plan which is funded by regular employee and company
contributions and administered through a contractual trust agreement. The final benefit is contribution-based with a minimum guarantee.
Due to this minimum guarantee, this plan is treated as a defined benefit plan for the purposes of these IFRS financial statements,
although it has many of the characteristics of a defined contribution plan.
Pension plans in the Rest of the World. These represent approximately 12% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation (2016: 12%) and
consist of a number of smaller plans in various countries. Of these the largest are the pension plans at Chugai, which are independently
managed by Chugai, and the main pension plan in the United Kingdom. The Chugai plans are fully described in Chugai’s own IFRS
financial statements. The UK pension plan is funded by regular employee and company contributions, with benefits based on final salary
and length of employment. This plan has been closed to new members since 2003 and has been replaced with a defined contribution plan.
In 2016 the Group made payments of EUR 66 million to the pension funds in Ireland in relation to the restructuring of the manufacturing
site at Clarecastle, Ireland. In 2017 further measures were taken. The Group entered into an annuity buyout agreement with an insurance
company and paid EUR 97 million from plan assets to settle the defined benefit obligation for all retired employees. In addition transfer
value payments of EUR 14 million from plan assets were made to deferred employees to settle the defined benefit obligation. The Group
recorded a settlement loss of EUR 11 million from these transactions in 2017.
Other post-employment benefit (‘OPEB’) plans. These represent approximately 6% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation
(2016: 7%) and consist of post-employment healthcare and life insurance schemes, mainly in the US. These plans are mainly unfunded
and/or are contributory for employees, with the Group reimbursing retired employees directly from its own financial resources.
The Group’s major OPEB plans in the US have been closed to new members since 2011. Part of the costs of these plans is reimbursable
under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. There is no statutory funding requirement for
these plans. The Group is funding these plans to the extent that it is tax efficient. In 2017 there were no payments made by the Group
to these plans (2016: none). At 31 December 2017 the IFRS funding status was 43% (2016: 44%), including reimbursement rights,
for the funded OPEB plans in the US.

Funding status
The funding of the Group’s various defined benefit plans is the responsibility of a senior governing body, such as a Board of Trustees,
and the sponsoring employer, and is managed based on local statutory valuations, which follow the legislation and requirements of
the respective jurisdiction in which the plan is established. Qualified independent actuaries carry out statutory actuarial valuations on
a regular basis. The actuarial assumptions determining the funding status on the statutory basis are regularly assessed by the local
senior governing body. The funding status is closely monitored at a corporate level. The unfunded plans are mainly those in the Group’s
German affiliates, where the fully reserved pension obligations are invested in the local affiliate’s operations.
In 2017 the IFRS funding status of the funded defined benefit plans improved to 91% (2016: 86%).
Reimbursement rights are linked to the post-employment medical plans in the US and represent the expected reimbursement of
the medical expenditure provided under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003.

Roche Finance Report 2017 | 91Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Plan assets
The responsibility for the investment strategies of funded plans is with the senior governance body such as the Board of Trustees.
Asset-liability studies are performed regularly for all major pension plans. These studies examine the obligations from post-employment
benefit plans, and evaluate various investment strategies with respect to key financial measures such as expected returns, expected
risks, expected contributions, and expected funded status of the plan in an interdependent way. The goal of an asset-liability study is
to select an appropriate asset allocation for the funds held within the plan. The investment strategy is developed to optimise expected
returns, to manage risks and to contain fluctuations in the statutory funded status. Asset-liability studies include strategies to match
the cash flows of the assets with the plan obligations. The Group currently does not use longevity swaps to manage longevity risk.
Plan assets are managed using internal and external asset managers. The actual performance is continually monitored by the pension
fund governance bodies as well as being closely monitored at a corporate level. In these financial statements the difference between
the interest income and actual return on plan assets is a remeasurement that is recorded directly to other comprehensive income.
During 2017 the actual return on plan assets was a gain of CHF 1,381 million (2016: gain of CHF 986 million).
The recognition of plan assets is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available from refunds from the plans or reductions
in future contributions to the plans.

Assets are invested in a variety of different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return as follows:
• Equity and debt securities which mainly have quoted market prices (Level 1 fair value hierarchy).
• Property which is mainly in private and commercial property funds which mainly have other observable inputs (Level 2 fair value
hierarchy).
• Cash and money market instruments which are mainly invested with financial institutions with a credit rating no lower than A.
• Other investments which mainly consist of alternatives, mortgages, commodities and insurance contracts. These are used for risk
management purposes and mainly have other observable inputs (Level 2 fair value hierarchy) and unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair
value hierarchy).
Included within the fair value of plan assets are the Group’s shares and non-voting securities with a fair value of CHF 121 million
(2016: CHF 120 million) and debt instruments issued by the Group with a fair value of CHF 9 million (2016: CHF 18 million).

Defined benefit obligation
The defined benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method. This reflects service rendered by employees to
the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of
benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth and mortality rates. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined
by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds in countries
where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. The corporate or government bonds are denominated in the currency in which
the benefits will be paid, and have maturity terms approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
The Group’s final salary-based defined benefit pension plans in the US, Germany and the United Kingdom have been closed to new
participants. Active employees that had been members of these pension plans at the time these were closed to new participants continue
to accrue benefits in the final salary-based defined benefit pension plans. New employees in the US and UK now join the Group’s defined
contribution plans, while new employees in Germany join the contribution-based plan with a minimum guarantee. As a result, the proportion
of the defined benefit obligation which relates to these closed plans is expected to decrease in the future. The defined benefit pension
plans in Switzerland, where the final benefit is contribution-based with a minimum guarantee, remain open to new employees.

Actuarial assumptions
The actuarial assumptions used in these financial statements are based on the requirements set out in IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’.
They are unbiased and mutually compatible estimates of variables that determine the ultimate cost of providing post-employment
benefits. They are set on an annual basis by local management, based on advice from actuaries, and are subject to approval by corporate
management and the Group’s actuaries. Actuarial assumptions consist of demographic assumptions on matters such as mortality
and employee turnover, and financial assumptions on matters such as interest rates, salary and benefit levels, inflation rates and costs
of medical benefits. The actuarial assumptions vary based upon local economic and social conditions. The actuarial assumptions used
in the various statutory valuations may differ from these based on local legal and regulatory requirements.
Demographic assumptions. The most significant demographic assumptions relate to mortality rates. The Group’s actuaries use mortality
tables which take into account historic patterns and expected changes, such as further increases in longevity. Rates of employee
turnover, disability and early retirement are based on historical behaviour. The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual
at the age of 65 is as follows:
Defined benefit plans: average life expectancy at the age of 65 for major schemes in years
Male Female
Country Mortality table 2017 2016 2017 2016
Switzerland BVG 2015 projected with CMI model 21.5 21.2 23.4 23.0
United States RP-2014 projected with MP-2014 22.3 22.2 23.9 23.8
Germany Heubeck tables 2005G 19.3 19.1 23.3 23.2
The mortality assumptions used for the pension plans in Switzerland were based on BVG 2015 applying the Continuous Mortality
Investigation (‘CMI’) model. A long-term rate of 1.25% (2016: 1.25%) was used for longevity improvements.
Financial assumptions. These are based on market expectations for the period over which the obligations are to be settled.
The assumptions used in the actuarial valuations are shown below.

Weighted Weighted
average Range average Range
Discount rates 1.80% 0.60%–6.80% 1.88% 0.10%–5.80%
Expected rates of salary increases 2.52% 0.00%–4.50% 2.56% 0.00%–4.50%
Expected rates of pension increases 0.67% 0.00%–3.00% 0.59% 0.00%–3.00%

Ultimate medical cost trend rate (in 2038) 4.50% 4.50% 4.50% 4.50%
Discount rates are determined with reference to interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds in countries where
there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. Expected rates of salary increases are based on expected inflation rates with an
adjustment to reflect the Group’s latest expectation of long-term real salary increases. Expected rates of pension increases are generally
linked to the expected inflation rate or the funding status of the plan. Expected inflation rates are derived by looking at the level of
inflation implied by the financial markets in conjunction with the economists’ price inflation forecasts, historic price inflation as well as
other economic variables and circumstances. Medical cost trend rates take into account the benefits set out in the plan terms and
expected future changes in medical costs. Since the Group’s major post-employment medical plans are for US employees, these rates
are driven by developments in the US.
Sensitivity analysis. The measurement of the net defined benefit obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate,
inflation rate, expected mortality and medical cost trend rate assumptions. The following table summarises the impact of a change
in those assumptions on the present value of the defined benefit obligation.

Immediate medical cost trend rate

Each sensitivity analysis considers the change in one assumption at a time leaving the other assumptions unchanged. This approach
shows the isolated effect of changing one individual assumption but does not take into account that some assumptions are related.
The method used to carry out the sensitivity analysis is the same as in the prior year.
Cash flows
The Group incurred cash flows from its defined benefit plans as shown in the table below.

Employer contributions, net of reimbursements – funded plans (392) (732)
Benefits paid – unfunded plans (146) (148)
Total cash inflow (outflow) (538) (880)
Based on the most recent actuarial valuations, the Group expects that employer contributions for funded plans in 2018 will be approximately
CHF 434 million, which includes an estimated CHF 154 million of additional contributions, mostly related to the US defined benefit plans.
Benefits paid for unfunded plans in 2018 are estimated to be approximately CHF 167 million, which mostly relate to the German defined
benefit plans.

26. Equity compensation plans
The Group operates several equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Chugai and Foundation Medicine. IFRS 2 ‘Share-
based Payment’ requires that the fair value of all equity compensation plan awards granted to employees be estimated at grant date and
recorded as an expense over the vesting period.

Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights. The Group issues Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs) to certain
directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The S-SARs give employees the right to receive non-
voting equity securities reflecting the value of any appreciation in the market price of the non-voting equity securities between the
grant date and the exercise date. Under the Roche S-SAR Plan 180 million S-SARs will be available for issuance over a ten-year period.
The rights, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years.

Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan. The Group issues Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) awards to certain directors, management and
employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The RSUs, which are non-tradable, represent the right to receive non-voting equity
securities which vest only after a three-year period, subject to performance conditions, if any. There are currently no performance
conditions on outstanding RSUs at 31 December 2017. Under the Roche RSU Plan 20 million non-voting equity securities will be available
for issuance over a ten-year period. The Roche RSU Plan also includes a value adjustment which will be an amount equivalent to the sum
of shareholder distributions made by the Group during the vesting period attributable to the number of non-voting equity securities for
which an individual award has been granted.

Roche Performance Share Plan. The Group offers future share and non-voting equity security awards (or, at the discretion of the
Board of Directors, their cash equivalent) to certain directors and key senior managers. These are non-tradable equity-settled awards.
The programme currently operates in annual three-year cycles. The Roche Performance Share Plan (PSP) includes a value adjustment
which will be an amount equivalent to the sum of shareholder distributions made by the Group during the vesting period attributable to
the number of shares or non-voting equity securities for which an individual award has been granted. The amount of shares or non-voting
equity securities allocated will depend upon the individual’s salary level, the achievement of performance targets linked to the Group’s
Total Shareholder Return (shares and non-voting equity securities combined) relative to the Group’s peers during the three-year period
from the date of the grant, and the discretion of the Board of Directors. Each award will result in between zero and two shares or non-
voting equity securities (before value adjustment), depending upon the achievement of the performance targets.

Roche Connect. This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the US and certain other countries, to make
regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting equity securities. It is administered by independent third parties. The
Group contributes to the programme, which allows the employees to purchase non-voting equity securities at a discount (usually 20%).
The administrator purchases the necessary non-voting equity securities directly from the market. At 31 December 2017 the administrator
held 2.8 million non-voting equity securities (2016: 2.6 million). In 2017 the cost of the plan was CHF 23 million (2016: CHF 20 million).
Roche Option Plan. This programme is used in countries where S-SARs are not used. Awards under this plan give employees the right
to purchase non-voting equity securities at an exercise price specified at the grant date. The options, which are non-tradable equity-
settled awards, have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over three years.

a) The fair value of the Roche RSUs is equivalent to the share price on the date of grant.
b) The input parameters were the covariance matrix between Roche and the other individual companies of the peer group based on a three-year history and a risk-free interest rate
of minus 0.956%. The valuation takes into account the defined rank and performance structure which determines the pay-out of the plan.
c) Volatility was determined primarily by reference to historically observed prices of the underlying equity. Risk-free interest rates are derived from zero coupon swap rates at
the grant date taken from Datastream.
d) The early exercise factor describes the ratio between the expected market price at the exercise date and the exercise price at which early exercises can be expected, based on
historically observed behaviour.

28. Statement of cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities arise from the Group’s primary activities in the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics Divisions. These are
calculated by the indirect method by adjusting the Group’s operating profit for any operating income and expenses that are not cash flows
(for example depreciation, amortisation and impairment) in order to derive the cash generated from operations. This and other operating
cash flows are shown in the statement of cash flows. Operating cash flows also include income taxes paid on all activities.

29. Risk management
Group risk management
Risk management is a fundamental element of the Group’s business practice on all levels and encompasses different types of risks.
At Group level, risk management is an integral part of the long-term forecasting and controlling processes. Material risks are monitored
and regularly discussed with the Corporate Executive Committee and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising from its underlying operations and corporate finance activities. The Group’s
financial risk exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices as well as
the creditworthiness and the solvency of the Group’s counterparties.
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies reviewed by the boards of directors of Roche, Chugai and Foundation
Medicine as appropriate to their areas of statutory responsibility. These policies cover credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
The policies provide guidance on risk limits, type of authorised financial instruments and monitoring procedures. As a general principle,
the policies prohibit the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Policy implementation and day-to-day
risk management are carried out by the relevant treasury functions and regular reporting on these risks is performed by the relevant
accounting and controlling functions within Roche, Chugai and Foundation Medicine.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations, causing financial losses for
the Group. The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses of liquid funds deposited with or invested in such
counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering netting agreements and
without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements, is equal to the carrying value of the Group’s financial assets.
Accounts receivable. At 31 December 2017 the Group has trade receivables of CHF 10.4 billion (2016: CHF 9.4 billion). These are subject
to a policy of active credit risk management which focuses on the assessment of country risk, credit availability, ongoing credit evaluation
and account monitoring procedures. The objective of trade receivables management is to maximise the collection of unpaid amounts.
At 31 December 2017 the Group’s combined trade receivables balance with three US national wholesale distributors, McKesson Corp.,
AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Cardinal Health, Inc., was equivalent to CHF 2.4 billion representing 23% of the Group’s consolidated trade
receivables (2016: CHF 1.7 billion representing 18%). There is no other significant concentration of counterparty credit risk due to the
Group’s large number of customers and their wide geographical spread. Risk limits and exposures are continuously monitored by country
and by the nature of counterparties. The Group obtains credit insurance and similar enhancements when appropriate to protect the
collection of trade receivables. At 31 December 2017 no collateral was held for trade receivables (2016: none).
102 | Roche Finance Report 2017Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Since 2010 there have been financial difficulties in Southern European countries, notably Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. The Group
is a leading supplier to the healthcare sectors in these countries and has trade receivables of CHF 0.9 billion (2016: CHF 0.8 billion)
with the public and private customers in these countries. The Group uses different measures to improve collections in these countries,
including intense communication with customers, factoring, negotiations of payments plans, charging of interest for late payments,
and legal action.
The nature and geographic location of counterparties to accounts receivable that are not overdue or impaired are shown in the table below.
These include the balances with US national wholesalers and Southern Europe public customers described above.

Cash and marketable securities. At 31 December 2017 the Group has cash and marketable securities of CHF 12.0 billion
(2016: CHF 9.0 billion). These are subject to a policy of restricting exposures to high-quality counterparties and setting defined limits
for individual counterparties. These limits and counterparty credit ratings are reviewed regularly. Investments in marketable securities
are entered into on the basis of guidelines with regard to liquidity, quality and maximum amount. As a general rule, the Group invests
only in high-quality securities with adequate liquidity. Cash and short-term time deposits are subject to rules which limit the Group’s
exposure to individual financial institutions.

Roche Finance Report 2017 | 103Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Master netting agreements. The Group enters into derivative transactions and collateral agreements under International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements with the respective counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty risk.
Under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding in the same
currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria
for offsetting in the balance sheet as the Group does not have a currently enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, because the
right to offset is only enforceable on the occurrence of future events, such as a default or other credit events.
Contract terms. At 31 December 2017 there are no significant financial assets whose terms have been renegotiated (2016: none).
Impairment losses. During 2017 total impairment losses for available-for-sale financial assets amounted to CHF 17 million
(2016: CHF 10 million).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time. The Group’s
approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements at any point in time.
Roche and Chugai enjoy strong credit quality and are rated by at least one major credit rating agency. The ratings will permit efficient
access to the international capital markets in the event of major financing requirements. At 31 December 2017 the Group has unused
committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling CHF 7.6 billion (2016: CHF 8.0 billion), of which CHF 7.3 billion serve
as a back-stop line for the commercial paper program.

Take-or-pay commitments. The Group has entered into contract manufacturing agreements with various companies to further develop
manufacturing capacity and flexibility, mainly in the Pharmaceuticals Division. There are future minimum take-or-pay commitments within
some of these agreements with a total potential commitment from the Group of CHF 1.9 billion at 31 December 2017 (2016: CHF 1.4 billion).
104 | Roche Finance Report 2017Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Market risk
Market risk arises from changing market prices, mainly foreign exchange rates and interest rates, of the Group’s financial assets or
financial liabilities which affect the Group’s financial result and equity.
Value-at-Risk. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to measure the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. VaR indicates
the value range within which a given financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices.
VaR is calculated using a historical simulation approach and for each scenario, all financial instruments are fully valued and the total
change in value and earnings is determined. VaR calculations are based on a 95% confidence level and a holding period of 20 trading
days over the past ten years. This holding period reflects the time required to change the corresponding risk exposure, should this
be deemed appropriate.
Actual future gains and losses associated with our treasury activities may differ materially from the VaR analyses due to the inherent
limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes to interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity investment
prices, particularly in periods of high market volatilities. Furthermore, VaR does not include the effect of changes in credit spreads.
Market risk of financial instruments in millions of CHF
2017 2016
VaR – Interest rate component 306 310
VaR – Foreign exchange component 24 38
VaR – Other price component 38 38
Diversification (43) (59)
VaR – Total market risk 325 327
The interest rate component remained largely stable. The foreign exchange component decreased due to a favourable exposure mix.
The other price component arises mainly from movements in equity security prices and remained largely stable.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group uses the Swiss franc as its reporting currency and as a result is exposed to movements in foreign currencies, mainly the
US dollar, Japanese yen and euro. The objective of the Group’s foreign exchange risk management activities is to preserve the economic
value of its current and future assets and to minimise the volatility of the Group’s financial result. The primary focus of the Group’s foreign
exchange risk management activities is on hedging transaction exposures arising through foreign currency flows or monetary positions
held in foreign currencies. The Group uses forward contracts, foreign exchange options and cross-currency swaps to hedge transaction
exposures. Application of these instruments intends to continuously lock in favourable developments of foreign exchange rates, thereby
reducing the exposure to potential future movements in such rates.
Interest rate risk
The Group mainly raises debt on a fixed rate basis for bonds and notes. The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates, mainly
for its US dollar, Swiss franc and euro floating rate financial instruments. The primary objective of the Group’s interest rate management
is to protect the net interest result. The Group may use forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge its interest rate exposures.
Depending on the interest rate environment of major currencies, the Group will use these instruments to generate an appropriate mix
of fixed and floating rate exposures.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 105Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Other price risk
Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities. The Group manages the price risk through placing limits
on individual and total equity investments. These limits are defined both as a percentage of total liquid funds and as an absolute number
for individual equity investments.
Capital management
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total capitalisation, being the sum of debt plus equity, including non-controlling
interests. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
• To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide benefits for patients and returns to
investors.
• To provide an adequate return to investors based on the level of risk undertaken.
• To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver future benefits for patients
and returns to investors.
• To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The capitalisation is reported to senior management as part of the Group’s regular internal management reporting and is shown in
the table below.

The Group’s net equity was significantly impacted by the 2009 Genentech transaction (see Note 21).
The Group is not subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements as known in the financial services industry. The Group has majority
shareholdings in Chugai and Foundation Medicine (see Note 22). Chugai and Foundation Medicine are public companies and their
objectives, policies and processes for managing their own capital are determined by local management.

Fair value hierarchy
The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:
• Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
• Level 2 – observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
• Level 3 – unobservable inputs.

Level 1 financial assets consist of treasury bills, bonds and quoted shares. Level 2 financial assets consist primarily of commercial paper,
certificates of deposit and derivative financial instruments.
The Group determines Level 2 fair values using the following valuation techniques:
• Marketable securities and derivative financial instruments are based on valuation models that use observable market data for interest
rates, yield curves, foreign exchange rates and implied volatilities for similar instruments at the measurement date.
• Available-for-sale investments are based on a valuation model derived from the most recently published observable financial prices.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period during which the transfer
has occurred. There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and vice versa during the year (2016: none).

of milestones. There was CHF 353 million of income, net, mainly from the reversal of the remaining provision related to the Seragon
acquisition and from the partial reversal of provisions mainly related to the Dutalys and Trophos acquisitions. Payments of CHF 146 million
were made for milestones related to the Genia, CMI, Ariosa, Santaris and other acquisitions.
Contingent consideration arrangements
The Group is party to certain contingent consideration arrangements arising from business combinations. The fair values are determined
considering the expected payments, discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted average discount rate of 3.1% (2016: 3.2%).
The expected payments are determined by considering the possible scenarios of forecast sales and other performance criteria, the
amount to be paid under each scenario, and the probability of each scenario. The significant unobservable inputs are the forecast sales,
other performance criteria and the risk-adjusted discount rate. The estimated fair value would increase if the forecast sales or other
performance criteria rates were higher or the risk-adjusted discount rate was lower. At 31 December 2017 the total potential payments
under contingent consideration arrangements could be up to CHF 1.4 billion (2016: CHF 2.9 billion) as follows:

Hedge accounting
At 31 December 2017 the Group has the following cash flow hedges and fair value hedges which are designated in a qualifying hedge
relationship.
Cash flow hedges. The Group has entered into cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk on some
of the bonds and notes issued by the Group which are denominated in euro. At 31 December 2017 such instruments are recorded
as a net fair value liability of CHF 9 million (2016: CHF 220 million). There was no ineffective portion.
Chugai has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a part of its foreign translation exposure to Swiss franc and US
dollar. At 31 December 2017 such instruments are recorded as fair value assets of CHF 4 million (2016: fair value assets of CHF 45 million).
There was no ineffective portion.
The expected undiscounted cash flows from qualifying cash flow hedges, including interest payments during the duration of the derivative
contract and final settlement on maturity, are shown in the table below.

The changes in the hedging reserve within equity are shown in Note 21.
Fair value hedges. The Group has entered into some interest rate swaps to hedge some of its fixed-term debt instruments.
At 31 December 2017 such instruments are recorded as fair value liabilities of CHF 18 million (2016: CHF 10 million) and fair value assets
of CHF 5 million (2016: CHF 23 million). During 2017 a loss of CHF 28 million was recorded on these interest rate swaps (2016: loss of
CHF 17 million). As the fair value hedge had been highly effective since inception, the result of the interest rate swaps was largely offset
by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt instruments.
Net investment hedges. The Group does not have any net investment hedges.

32. Significant accounting policies
Consolidation policy
Subsidiaries are all companies over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Companies acquired during the year are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group, and subsidiaries to
be divested are included up to the date on which control passes from the Group. Intercompany balances, transactions and resulting
unrealised income are eliminated in full. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they
occur after control has already been obtained and if they do not result in a loss of control. Associates are companies over which the
Group exercises, or has the power to exercise, significant influence, but which it does not control and they are accounted for using the
equity method.
Segment reporting
For the purpose of segment reporting the Group’s Corporate Executive Committee (CEC) is considered to be the Group’s Chief Operating
Decision Maker. The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the organisation units for which information is reported
to the CEC on a regular basis. The information provided is used as the basis of the segment revenue and profit disclosures reported in
Note 2, with the geographic analysis based on the location of customers. Selected segment balance sheet information is also routinely
provided to the CEC.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis. Operating assets and liabilities consist of property, plant
and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade receivables/payables, inventories and other assets and liabilities, such as provisions,
which can be reasonably attributed to the reported operating segments. Non-operating assets and liabilities mainly include current
and deferred income tax balances, post-employment benefit assets/liabilities and financial assets/liabilities such as cash, marketable
securities, investments and debt.
Foreign currency translation
The Annual Financial Statements are presented in Swiss francs. Most Group companies use their local currency as their functional
currency. Certain Group companies use other currencies (such as US dollar, Swiss franc or euro) as their functional currency where
this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Local transactions in other currencies are initially
reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses from the settlement of such transactions and gains
and losses on translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are included in income, except when they
are qualifying cash flow hedges or arise on monetary items that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign entity.
In such cases the gains and losses are deferred into other comprehensive income.
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using functional currencies other than Swiss francs are translated into Swiss
francs using year-end rates of exchange. The income statement and statement of cash flows are translated at the average rates of exchange
for the year. Translation differences due to the changes in exchange rates between the beginning and the end of the year and the difference
between net income translated at the average and year-end exchange rates are taken directly to other comprehensive income.
Revenues
Sales represent amounts received and receivable for goods supplied to customers after deducting trade discounts, cash discounts and
volume rebates, and exclude value added taxes and other taxes directly linked to sales. Revenues from the sale of products are recognised
upon transfer to the customer of significant risks and rewards. Trade discounts, cash discounts and volume rebates are recorded on
an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of the related sales. Estimates of expected sales returns, chargebacks and other rebates,
including Medicaid in the US and similar rebates in other countries, are also deducted from sales and recorded as accrued liabilities
or provisions or as a deduction from accounts receivable. Such estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual or legislatively
mandated obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience. If the circumstances are such that the level of sales returns, and
hence revenues, cannot be reliably measured, then sales are only recognised when the right of return expires, which is generally upon
prescription of the products to patients. Other revenues are recorded as earned or as the services are performed. Single transactions
are split into separately identifiable components to reflect the substance of the transaction, where necessary. Conversely, two or more
transactions may be considered together for revenue recognition purposes, where the commercial effect cannot be understood
without reference to the series of transactions as a whole.
118 | Roche Finance Report 2017Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and related production overheads of goods sold and services rendered.
Royalties, alliance and collaboration expenses, including all collaboration profit-sharing arrangements are also reported as part of cost
of sales. Start-up costs between validation and the achievement of normal production capacity are expensed as incurred.
Research and development
Internal research and development activities are expensed as incurred for the following:
• Internal research costs incurred for the purpose of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.
• Internal development costs incurred for the application of research findings or other knowledge to plan and develop new products
for commercial production. The development projects undertaken by the Group are subject to technical, regulatory and other
uncertainties, such that, in the opinion of management, the criteria for capitalisation as intangible assets are not met prior to obtaining
marketing approval by the regulatory authorities in major markets.
• Post-marketing studies after regulatory approval, such as phase IV costs in the pharmaceuticals business, generally involve safety
surveillance and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives marketing approval to be sold. They may be required by regulatory
authorities or may be undertaken for safety or commercial reasons. The costs of such post-marketing studies are not capitalised as
intangible assets as, in the opinion of management, they do not generate separately identifiable incremental future economic benefits
that can be reliably measured.
Acquired in-process research and development resources obtained through in-licensing arrangements, business combinations or separate
asset purchases are capitalised as intangible assets. The acquired asset must be controlled by the Group, be separately identifiable
and expected to generate future economic benefits, even if uncertainty exists as to whether the research and development will ultimately
result in a marketable product. Consequently, upfront and milestone payments to third parties for pharmaceutical products or compounds
before regulatory marketing approval are recognised as intangible assets. Assets acquired through such arrangements are measured
on the basis set out in the ‘Intangible assets’ policy. Subsequent internal research and development costs incurred post-acquisition are
treated in the same way as other internal research and development costs. If research and development are embedded in contracts for
strategic alliances, the Group carefully assesses whether upfront or milestone payments constitute funding of research and development
work or acquisition of an asset.
Licensing, milestone and other upfront receipts
Royalty income is recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the respective licensing agreements. If the
collectability of a royalty amount is not reasonably assured, those royalties are recognised as revenue when the cash is received. Certain
Group companies receive upfront, milestone and other similar payments from third parties relating to the sale or licensing of products
or technology. Revenue associated with performance milestones is recognised based on achievement of the deliverables as defined
in the respective agreements. Upfront payments and licence fees for which there are subsequent deliverables are initially reported
as deferred income and are recognised in income as earned over the period of the development collaboration or the manufacturing
obligation.
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits include wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, profit sharing and
bonuses, and non-monetary benefits for current employees. The costs are recognised within the operating results when the employee
has rendered the associated service. The Group recognises a liability for profit sharing and bonuses where contractually obliged or
where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Long-term employee benefits include long-service or sabbatical leave, long-service benefits and long-term disability benefits.
The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment. Any changes in the carrying value of other long-term
employee benefit liabilities are recognised within the operating results.
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever
an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. Termination costs are recognised at the earlier of when
the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of the benefits or when the Group recognises any related restructuring costs.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 119Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
For defined contribution plans the Group contributions are recognised within the operating results when the employee has rendered
the associated service. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future
payments is available.
For defined benefit plans the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair
value of the plan assets. All changes in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as they occur as follows:
Recognised in the income statement:
• Current service costs are charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results.
• Past service costs, including curtailment gains or losses, are recognised immediately in general and administration within the operating
results.
• Settlement gains or losses are recognised in general and administration within the operating results.
• Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is recognised in financing costs.
Recognised in other comprehensive income:
• Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments (the difference between previous assumptions and what has actually
occurred) and changes in actuarial assumptions.
• The return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability.
• Any change in the limit on the recognition of plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is comprised of interest income on plan assets, interest cost on the defined benefit
obligation and interest on the effect of the limit on the recognition of pension assets. The net interest is calculated using the same discount
rate that is used in calculating the defined benefit obligation, applied to the net defined liability at the start of the period, taking account
of any changes from contribution or benefit payments.
Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to use
the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan.
Equity compensation plans
The fair value of all equity compensation awards granted to employees is estimated at the grant date and recorded as an expense over
the vesting period. The expense is charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results. For equity-settled
plans, an increase in equity is recorded for this expense and any subsequent cash flows from exercises of vested awards are recorded
as changes in equity.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction, and include all costs directly attributable to
bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
These include items such as costs of site preparation, installation and assembly costs, and professional fees. The net costs of testing
whether the asset is functioning properly, including validation costs, are also included in the initially recorded cost of construction.
Interest and other borrowing costs incurred with respect to qualifying assets are capitalised and included in the carrying value of the
assets. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis, except for land, which is not depreciated. The estimated
useful lives of major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
Land improvements 40 years
Buildings 10–50 years
Machinery and equipment 4–15 years
Diagnostic instruments 3–5 years
Office equipment 3–6 years
Motor vehicles 5–8 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate components.
The estimated useful lives of the assets are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation charges are accelerated. Repairs
and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
120 | Roche Finance Report 2017Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Leases
Where the Group is the lessee. Finance leases exist when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the
Group. Finance leases are capitalised at the start of the lease at fair value, or the present value of the minimum lease payments, if lower.
The rental obligation, net of finance charges, is reported within debt. Finance lease assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease
term and its useful life. The interest element of the lease payment is charged against income over the lease term based on the effective
interest rate method. Operating leases exist when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group.
Payments made under operating leases are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where the Group is the lessor. Certain assets, mainly Diagnostics instruments, are leased to third parties through both finance and
operating lease arrangements. Finance lease assets are reported as receivables at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease.
Lease income from finance leases is recognised over the term of the lease based on the effective interest rate method. Operating lease
assets are reported within property, plant and equipment. Lease income from operating leases is recognised over the lease term on
a straight-line basis.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. At the date of acquisition the Group initially
recognises the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired
business. The consideration transferred is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. Where the Group does not acquire 100%
ownership of the acquired business, non-controlling interests are recorded either at fair value or as the proportion of the fair value
of the acquired net assets attributable to the non-controlling interest. Directly attributable acquisition-related costs are expensed as
incurred within general and administration expenses.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises in a business combination and is the excess of the consideration transferred to acquire the business over the underlying
fair value of the net identified assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually and upon the
occurrence of an indication of impairment.
Intangible assets
Purchased patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Assets that have been acquired
through a business combination are initially recorded at fair value. Once available for use, intangible assets are amortised on a straight-
line basis over their useful lives. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date. The estimated useful life is the
lower of the legal duration and the economic useful life. The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are regularly reviewed. Estimated
useful lives of major classes of amortisable intangible assets are as follows:
Product intangibles in use up to 20 years
Marketing intangibles in use up to 10 years
Technology intangibles in use up to 14 years
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
An impairment assessment is carried out when there is evidence that an asset may be impaired. In addition, intangible assets that
are not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. When the recoverable amount of an asset, being the higher of its fair value
less costs of disposal and its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value is reduced to its recoverable amount.
This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. Value in use is calculated using estimated cash flows, generally
over a five-year period, with extrapolating projections for subsequent years. These are discounted using an appropriate long-term
interest rate. When an impairment loss arises, the useful life of the asset is reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation/
amortisation charge is accelerated. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively
to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the
income statement as an impairment reversal.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 121Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is assessed for impairment at each reporting date and is additionally tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is allocated
to cash-generating units and when the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, being the higher of its fair value less costs of
disposal or its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value of the goodwill is reduced to its recoverable amount.
This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. When an acquired business that is included within a cash-
generating unit permanently ceases to operate then it is treated as a disposal of that business. For separately identifiable goodwill that
was generated on the initial acquisition of that business and where all of the factors that made up that goodwill are entirely unrelated
to the continuing operations of the cash-generating unit, then the goodwill is deemed to have been disposed of and is fully impaired.
The impairment testing methodology is further described in Note 8.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods, work in process and intermediates
includes raw materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs and overheads based upon the normal capacity of production
facilities. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less cost to
completion and selling expenses.
Accounts receivable
Accounts receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts, trade discounts, cash discounts,
volume rebates and similar allowances. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded where there is objective evidence that the Group
will not be able to collect all amounts due. These estimates are based on specific indicators, such as the ageing of customer balances,
specific credit circumstances and the Group’s historical experience, taking also into account economic conditions. Expenses for doubtful
trade receivables are recognised within marketing and distribution expenses. Trade discounts, cash discounts, volume rebates and
similar allowances are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of the related sales, using estimates based on existing
contractual obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and time, call and current balances with banks and similar institutions. Such balances
are only reported as cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes
in their fair value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to an outflow of resources
that can be reliably estimated. In particular, restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan that has
either commenced implementation or has been announced. Provisions are recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to
arise and are discounted when the time value of money is material. A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation
will only be confirmed by future events or where the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability. Contingent
assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Fair values
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices or by the use of established valuation
techniques such as option pricing models and the discounted cash flow method if quoted prices in an active market are not available.
122 | Roche Finance Report 2017Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are classified into the following categories which are disclosed in Note 29.
Available-for-sale. These are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated as such or are not classified in any other
financial asset category. Available-for-sale assets are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value. Changes in fair value
are recorded in other comprehensive income, except for impairments and interest and foreign exchange components. When an
investment is derecognised, the cumulative gains and losses in equity are reclassified to financial income (expense). Available-for-sale
assets are mainly comprised of marketable securities.
Fair value – hedging instruments. These are derivative financial instruments that are used to manage the exposures to foreign currency,
interest rate, equity market and credit risks. Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value.
Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, all changes in fair value are recorded as other
financial income (expense).
Fair value – designated. These are non-derivative financial instruments that are designated as fair value through profit or loss on initial
recognition. Designated fair value instruments are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value with changes in fair value
recorded in the income statement. Designated fair value instruments are mainly comprised of contingent consideration liabilities with
changes in fair value recorded in general and administration within the operating results.
Loans and receivables. These are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. Loans and receivables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest
rate method, less any impairment losses. Loans and receivables are mainly comprised of accounts receivable and cash and cash
equivalents.
Other financial liabilities. These are non-derivative financial liabilities. Other financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value and
subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Other financial liabilities are mainly comprised of debt
and trade payables.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual cash flows from the asset expire or when the Group transfers the rights to
receive the contractual cash flows from the financial assets in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
of the financial asset are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when the contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled
or expire.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are individually assessed for possible impairment at each reporting date. An impairment charge is recorded where
there is objective evidence of impairment, such as where the issuer is in bankruptcy, default or other significant financial difficulty.
Available-for-sale equity securities that have a market value of more than 25% below their original cost, or have a market value below
their original cost for a sustained six-month period will be considered as impaired.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, any impairment charge is the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable
amount, calculated using estimated future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate. For available-for-sale financial
assets, any impairment charge is the amount currently carried in other comprehensive income for the difference between the original
cost and the fair value.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
For debt securities measured at amortised cost or available-for-sale, the reversal is recognised in income. For equity securities held
as available-for-sale, the reversal is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 123Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
Hedge accounting
The Group uses derivatives to manage its exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. The instruments
used may include interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, forwards contracts and options. The Group generally limits the use of
hedge accounting to certain significant transactions. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet several
strict conditions on documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. While many of these
transactions can be considered as hedges in economic terms, if the required conditions are not met, then the relationship does not
qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no
hedging relationship, which means that any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial income
(expense).
Cash flow hedge. This is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a
recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss. The hedging instrument is recorded
at fair value. The effective portion of the hedge is included in other comprehensive income and any ineffective portion is reported in
financial income (expense). If the hedging relationship is the hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment or highly probable
forecasted transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging
instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive income are included in the initial carrying value of the non-financial item
at the date of recognition. For all other cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have
been recorded in other comprehensive income are included in financial income (expense) when the forecasted transaction affects
net income.
Fair value hedge. This is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or an unrecognised firm
commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect
profit or loss. The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item is recorded at its previous carrying value, adjusted
for any changes in fair value that are attributable to the hedged risk. Changes in the fair values are reported in financial income (expense).
Debt
Debt instruments are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Subsequently they are reported
at amortised cost. Any discount between the net proceeds received and the principal value due on redemption is amortised over
the duration of the debt instrument and is recognised as part of financing costs using the effective interest rate method.
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding taxes payable on the distribution
of retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based on income, such as property and capital taxes, are included within general
and administration expenses.
Liabilities for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally relating
to subsidiaries, are only recognised where it is probable that such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future. Where the amount
of tax liabilities is uncertain, accruals are recorded within income tax liabilities for management’s best estimate of the ultimate liability
that is expected to arise based on the specific circumstances and the Group’s historical experience.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
carrying values. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the same taxation authority and when
there is a legally enforceable right to offset them. Deferred taxes are determined based on the currently enacted tax rates applicable
in each tax jurisdiction where the Group operates.
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The original purchase cost, consideration
received for subsequent resale of these equity instruments and other movements are reported as changes in equity. These instruments
are held for the Group’s potential conversion obligations that may arise from the Group’s equity compensation plans.
124 | Roche Finance Report 2017Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Group
Changes in accounting policies
In 2017 the Group has implemented various minor amendments to existing standards and interpretations, which have no material impact
on the Group’s overall results and financial position.
Future new and revised standards
The Group has assessed the expected impacts of the various new and revised standards and interpretations that will be mandatory from
1 January 2018 which the Group has not yet applied, as summarised below. Based on the analysis to date, the Group does not anticipate
that these will have a material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position, and furthermore no restatements of the 2017
comparative results will be necessary when the new standards are applied in 2018.
The Group is also assessing other new and revised standards which are not mandatory until after 2018.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’
The Group will implement the new standard effective 1 January 2018. The new standard will replace IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement’. The standard deals with the classification, recognition and measurement (including impairment)
of financial instruments and also introduces a new hedge accounting model. The new standard will result in an increased volume of
disclosure information in the Annual Financial Statements.
Classification and measurement of financial instruments. Currently all marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale
under IAS 39. Under the new standard equity securities will be classified as fair value through profit and loss, debt securities and money
market instrument as fair value through other comprehensive income (‘OCI’) and time accounts over three months as amortised cost.
The Group will elect to classify certain strategic equity investments at fair value through OCI. Additionally it is expected that there will be
a reclassification within equity, with unrealised gains of CHF 110 million, net of tax, being transferred from fair value reserves to retained
earnings on 1 January 2018.
Impairment of financial assets. On 1 January 2018 the Group will change the methodology of assessing impairment of its financial
assets from the incurred loss model (used in IAS 39) to the expected credit loss model (used in IFRS 9). In accordance with the
transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group will not restate prior periods but it will reassess the impairment allowances under the new
approach as of 1 January 2018. As a result the allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable is expected to increase by
CHF 8 million and the loss allowance for other financial assets to increase by CHF 1 million. This will be recognised, together with the
related deferred tax impact, as an adjustment of retained earnings on 1 January 2018.
Hedge accounting. The new standard introduces a new hedge accounting model which requires hedge accounting relationships to
be based upon the Group’s own risk management strategy and objectives and to be discontinued only when the relationships no longer
qualify for hedge accounting. The Group will apply the revised hedge accounting guidance to its hedging relationships prospectively
with effect from 1 January 2018. All hedge accounting relationships designated under the previous IAS 39 guidance are expected to
continue to be valid hedge accounting relationships in accordance with IFRS 9.
Presentational changes. As a result of implementing IFRS 9, the Group will make a number of presentational changes to the statement
of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, Note 3 within ‘Other financial income (expense)’ and Note 29 within
‘Level 3 fair values’ and within ‘Hedge accounting’.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 125Roche Group | Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS 15 ‘Revenues from Contracts with Customers’
The Group will implement the new standard effective 1 January 2018. The new standard will replace IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11
‘Construction Contracts’. IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is
recognised, and also contains new requirements related to presentation. The core principle in that framework is that revenue should
be recognised dependent on the transfer of promised goods or services to the customer for an amount that reflects the consideration
which should be received in exchange for those goods or services. The objective of the standard is to provide a five-step approach to
revenue recognition that includes identifying contracts with customers, identifying performance obligations, determining transaction
prices, allocating transaction prices to performance obligations, and recognising revenue when or as performance obligations are
satisfied. Judgement will need to be applied, including making estimates and assumptions, for multiple-element contracts in identifying
performance obligations, in constraining estimates of variable consideration and in allocating the transaction price to each performance
obligation and to lease components (if any), particularly in the Diagnostics business and for out-licensing agreements. The new standard
will result in an increased volume of disclosure information in the Annual Financial Statements.
Changes introduced by the standard relevant to the Roche Group. The new standard provides new requirements and additional
guidance that are relevant to the Group, notably on the following areas:
• Revenue from licences of intellectual property, including sales-based royalties, on constraining estimates of variable consideration
such as development milestones, and on providing a material right to receive additional goods free of charge under certain patient
access programmes that may be regarded as a separate performance obligation involving variable consideration. The Group does
not anticipate a material impact from these changes.
• The new standard also clarifies how to allocate sales, including the treatment of discounts, to each element in multiple-elements
contracts and when to recognise sales for each of those elements. Such contracts are entered into in the Diagnostics Division and
typically include obligations for instruments (including those provided under leasing arrangements), reagents and other consumables,
and services. It requires the use of estimates and assumptions and some judgement to apply this guidance in practice. The Group
does not anticipate a material impact from this guidance.
• Out-licensing contracts in the Pharmaceuticals Division may be entered into with no further obligation or may include commitments
to research, late-stage development, regulatory approval, co-marketing or manufacturing. These may be settled by a combination
of up-front payments, milestone payments, and reimbursements for services provided. Whether to consider these commitments
as a single performance obligation or separate ones, or even being in scope of IFRS 15, is not straight-forward and requires some
judgement. Depending on the conclusion, this may result in all revenue being calculated at inception and either being recognised
at once or spread over the term of a longer performance obligation. The answers under the new standard may be different from
those currently used. The new standard provides an exemption for sales-based royalties for licences of intellectual property which
will continue to be recognised as revenue as underlying sales are incurred.
Transition approach and use of practical expedients. The Group will apply the full retrospective method for the transition. Certain
practical expedients permitted by the standard during the transition will also be used, notably the relief to not restate contracts that
began and were completed in 2017 or were completed before 1 January 2017 and to not provide in 2018 the disclosure requirement as
per IFRS 15 paragraph 120 for the comparative 2017 period (‘amount of the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance
obligations’). Since the new standard, including the use of practical expedients, does not modify the timing or amounts of revenue
recognised for 2017 no restatement will be necessary.
Presentational changes. As a result of implementing IFRS 15, the Group will make a presentational change to the income statement
in 2018 to include a subtotal ‘Revenue’, and will create a new note for ‘Revenue’ to include the increased volume of required disclosure
information.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’
The Group will implement the new standard effective 1 January 2019 and will apply the cumulative catch-up method for the transition,
meaning that the comparative 2018 results will not be restated when the new standard is applied. The new standard will result in
an increased volume of disclosure information in the Annual Financial Statements.
The main impact of the new standard will be to bring operating leases on-balance sheet. The Group is assessing the potential impact,
but currently anticipates that the new standard will result in the carrying value of leased assets being increased by approximately
CHF 1.2 billion, with lease liabilities increased by a similar amount at the date of implementation. The application of the new standard
will result in part of what are currently reported as operating lease costs being recorded as interest expenses. Given the leases involved
and the current low interest rate environment, the Group does not currently expect this effect to be material.

Report of Roche Management on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate control over
financial reporting. The internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance over the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be
effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2017 based on
the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has concluded
that the system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 31 December 2017.
The Statutory Auditor KPMG AG has audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended
31 December 2017, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA). They have
also issued a report on the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control over financial reporting. This report is set out on
pages 136 to 137.

Statutory Auditor’s Report
To the General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise
the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2017 and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement
of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year
then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements (pages 40 to 126) give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial
position of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for
the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and Swiss Auditing
Standards. Our responsibilities under those provisions and Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities
for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance
with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as the IESBA Code of Ethics
for Professional Accountants, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Other Information in the Annual Report
The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information in the annual report. The other information comprises all
information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial
statements of the company, the remuneration report and our auditor’s reports thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information in the annual report and we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information in the
annual report and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that
fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibility of the Board of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view
in accordance with IFRS and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
Swiss law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and
maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,
or the override of internal control.
— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances.
— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made.
— Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or,
if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as
a going concern.
134 | Roche Finance Report 2017Statutory Auditor’s Report | Roche Group
— Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures,
and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation.
— Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction,
supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit.
We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and communicate to them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about
the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report
because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of
such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and the Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control
system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions
of the Board of Directors.
We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

Roche Finance Report 2017 | 135Roche Group | Independent Reasonable Assurance Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Independent Reasonable Assurance Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
To the Board of Directors of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
We were engaged by the Board of Directors to carry out a reasonable assurance engagement on the design, implementation
and operating effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting of the Roche Group as it was in place at
31 December 2017. Management of Roche Holding Ltd assessed the effectiveness of its system of internal control over
financial reporting as of 31 December 2017 based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described
in Internal Control – Integrated Framework 2013, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and Management
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as included in
the accompanying Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
An entity’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). An entity’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in
accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a material effect
on the entity’s financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our Responsibilities
Our responsibility is to examine the design, implementation and effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial
reporting and to report thereon in the form of an independent, reasonable assurance conclusion, based on the evidence
obtained. We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE)
3000 Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the International
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained, in all material respects.
The procedures selected depend on our judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the
design, implementation and effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. Our examination included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, testing and evaluating the design, implementation and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures, as we
considered necessary in the circumstances.
136 | Roche Finance Report 2017Independent Reasonable Assurance Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting | Roche Group
Our Independence and Quality Control
The firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality
control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards
and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants
issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity,
objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.
Conclusion
Our conclusion has been formed on the basis of, and is subject to, the matters outlined in this report.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.
In our opinion, the Roche Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
31 December 2017 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and International Standards on Auditing, the consolidated
financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended 31 December 2017 and our report dated 29 January 2018
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Alternative Performance Measures
The financial information included in the Financial Review includes certain Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) which are not
accounting measures as defined by IFRS, in particular the core results, net working capital, net operating assets, free cash flow and
constant exchange rates. These APMs should not be used instead of, or considered as alternatives to, the Group’s consolidated financial
results based on IFRS. These APMs may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies. All APMs
presented in the Financial Review relate to the performance of the current year and comparative periods.
Core results
Core results allow for an assessment of both the Group’s actual results as defined by IFRS and the underlying performance of
the business. The core results concept, which is used in the internal management of the business, is based on the IFRS results,
with the following adjustments:
• Global restructuring plans (see Note 6) are excluded.
• Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (see Note 9) and impairment of goodwill (see Note 8) are excluded.
• Acquisition accounting and other impacts from the accounting for alliance arrangements and business combinations
(see Financial Review) are excluded.
• Discontinued operations (currently none) are excluded.
• Legal and environmental cases (see Financial Review) are excluded.
• Global issues outside the healthcare sector beyond the Group’s control are excluded.
• Material treasury items such as major debt restructurings (currently none) are excluded.
• Pension plan settlements (see Note 25) are excluded.
• The tax benefit recorded under IFRS in respect of Equity Compensation Plans (ECPs), which varies according to the price of the
underlying equity, is replaced by a normalised tax benefit, being the IFRS 2 expense multiplied by the applicable tax rate (see Note 4).
The core results concept was further described on 22 October 2010 at an Investor Update teleconference, which is available for
download at: http://www.roche.com/investors/ir_agenda/csr_151010.htm
The Group’s IFRS results, including the divisional breakdown, are reconciled to the core results in the tables below. The calculation of
Core EPS is also given in the tables below. Additional commentary to the adjustment items is given in the Financial Review.

Free cash flow
Free cash flow is used to assess the Group’s ability to generate the cash required to conduct and maintain its operations. It also indicates
the Group’s ability to generate cash to finance dividend payments, repay debt and to undertake merger and acquisition activities.
The free cash flow concept is used in the internal management of the business.
Operating free cash flow is calculated based on the IFRS operating profit and adjusted for certain cash items, movements in net working
capital and capital expenditures (investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets). Operating free cash flow is different
from cash flows from operating activities as defined by IAS 7 in that it includes capital expenditures (which is within the responsibility of
divisional management) and excludes income taxes paid (which is not within the responsibility of divisional management). Cash outflows
from defined benefit plans are allocated to the operating free cash flow based on the current service cost with the residual allocated to
treasury activities.
Free cash flow is calculated as the operating free cash flow adjusted for treasury activities and taxes paid. Free cash flow is different
from total cash flows as defined by IAS 7 in that it excludes dividend payments, cash inflows/outflows from financing activities such
as issuance/repayment of debt, purchase/sale of marketable securities and cash inflows/outflows from mergers, acquisitions and
divestments.

EBITDA
The Group does not use Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) in either its internal management
reporting or its external communications. In the opinion of the Group’s management, operating free cash flow gives a more useful
and consistent measurement of ‘cash earnings’ than EBITDA, which includes many non-cash items such as provisions, allowances for
trade receivables and inventories, and certain non-cash entries arising from acquisition accounting and pension accounting.
For the convenience of those readers that do use EBITDA, this is provided in the table below. As the starting point this uses the core
results, which already exclude the amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.

Net operating assets
Net operating assets allow for an assessment of the Group’s operating performance of the business independently from financing
and tax activities. Net operating assets are calculated as property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, net working capital
and long-term net operating assets minus provisions.
The calculation of the net operating assets disclosed in Note 2 of the Annual Financial Statements is shown in the tables below.

Net debt
Net debt is used to monitor the Group’s overall short- and long-term liquidity. Net debt is calculated as the sum of total debt
(long-term and short-term) less marketable securities, cash and cash equivalents.
Net debt calculations, including details of movements during the current year, are shown in the table on page 32 in the Financial Review.
Roche Finance Report 2017 | 147Roche Group | Multi-Year Overview and Supplementary Information
Net working capital
Net working capital is used to assess the Group’s efficiency in utilising assets and short-term liquidity. Net trade working capital
is calculated as trade receivables and inventories minus trade payables. Net working capital is calculated as net trade working capital
adjusted for other receivables and other payables.
Net working capital and net trade working capital calculations are shown in the tables on page 19 (Pharmaceuticals Division), page 25
(Diagnostics Division) and page 27 (Corporate) in the Financial Review.
Constant exchange rates
Certain percentage changes in the Financial Review have been calculated using constant exchange rates (CER) which allow for
an assessment of the Group’s financial performance with the effects of exchange rate fluctuations eliminated. The percentage changes
at constant exchange rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the current reported period and the prior period
numbers at constant currency exchange rates, equalling the average exchange rates for the prior year. For example, a CER change
between a 2017 line item and its 2016 equivalent is calculated using the average exchange rate for the year ended 31 December 2016
for both the 2017 line item and the 2016 line item and subsequently calculating the change in percent with respect to the two
recalculated numbers.
Foreign exchange gains and losses are excluded from the calculation of CER growth rates in the earnings per share calculations.
In countries where there is a significant devaluation in the local currency in the current year, the simulations use the average exchange
rate of the current year instead of the prior year to avoid that CER growth rates are artificially inflated.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel (the ‘Company’) have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Swiss Law
on Accounting and Financial Reporting (32nd title of the Swiss Code of Obligations, ‘CO’). Where not prescribed by law, the significant
accounting principles applied are described below.
The Company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with a recognised accounting standard (International
Financial Reporting Standards). In accordance with the CO, the Company decided to forgo presenting additional information on audit fees
in the notes as well as a cash flow statement.
Valuation methods and translation of foreign currencies
Marketable securities are reported at the lower of cost or market value. All other financial assets, including investments, are reported
at cost less appropriate write-downs. Own equity instruments are recognised at cost and deducted from equity at the time of purchase.
If the own equity instruments are sold, the gain or loss is recognised through the income statement. Assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange, except investments which are translated at
historical rates. Transactions during the year which are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates effective
at the relevant transaction dates. Resulting exchange gains and losses are recognised in the income statement with the exception of
unrealised gains which are deferred.
Investments
The direct and indirect investments of the Company are listed in Note 31 to the Roche Group Annual Financial Statements. This listing
excludes the subsidiaries of Chugai and FMI as well as not material companies, notably companies that are inactive, dormant or in
liquidation. Ownership interests equal voting rights.
Taxes
Direct taxes include corporate income and capital taxes.
2. Shareholders’ equity
Share capital
As in the previous year, share capital amounts to CHF 160 million. The share capital consists of 160,000,000 bearer shares with a nominal
value of CHF 1 each. Included in equity are 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine). They are not part of the share
capital and confer no voting rights. However, each non-voting equity security confers the same rights as any of the shares to participate
in the available earnings and in any remaining proceeds from liquidation following repayment of the nominal value of the share capital and,
if any, participation certificates.
154 | Roche Finance Report 2017Notes to the Financial Statements | Roche Holding Ltd, Basel

Roche Finance Report 2017 | 159Roche Holding Ltd, Basel | Statutory Auditor’s Report
Statutory Auditor’s Report
To the General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2017,
the income statement for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant
accounting policies.
In our opinion the financial statements (pages 151 to 159) for the year ended 31 December 2017 comply with Swiss law and
the company’s articles of incorporation.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those
provisions and Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
section of our report. We are independent of the entity in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements
of the Swiss audit profession and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Report on Key Audit Matters based on the circular 1/2015 of the Federal Audit Oversight Authority
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial
statements of the current period. We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report.
Responsibility of the Board of Directors for the Financial Statements
The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of
Swiss law and the company’s articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the entity’s ability to continue as
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but
to do so.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance
is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing
Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions
of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
160 | Roche Finance Report 2017Statutory Auditor’s Report | Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
As part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and
maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override
of internal control.
— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control.
— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
disclosures made.
— C onclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures
are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern.
We communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit.
We also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably
be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that
were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,
in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and the Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control
system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board
of Directors.
We further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the company’s articles
of incorporation. We recommend that the financial statements submitted to you be approved.

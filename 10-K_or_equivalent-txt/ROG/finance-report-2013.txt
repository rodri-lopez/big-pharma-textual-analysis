CER (Constant Exchange Rates): The percentage changes in Constant Exchange Rates are calculated using simulations by reconsolidating both the 2013 and
2012 results at constant currencies (the average rates for the year ended 31 December 2012).
Core results and Core EPS (earnings per share): These exclude non-core items such as global restructuring charges and the amortisation and impairment of goodwill
and intangible assets. This allows a transparent assessment of both the actual results and the underlying performance of the business. A full income statement for
the Group and the operating results of the divisions are shown on both an IFRS and core basis. The core concept is fully described on pages 144–147 and
reconciliations between the IFRS and core results are given there.Finance – 2013 in brief
Roche in 2013 The Roche Group reported strong overall results in 2013. Core operating profit grew ahead of
sales, and core earnings per share increased by 10% at constant exchange rates (CER). The Swiss
franc was stronger at average rates against some major currencies, notably the Japanese yen and
US dollar, which had a negative overall impact on the income statement and cash flows expressed
in Swiss francs.
Sales Group sales increased by 6% (CER) to 46.8 billion Swiss francs (+3% growth in Swiss franc terms).
Pharmaceuticals sales growth was 7% (CER). The strong growth in both established and new
oncology products, Actemra/RoActemra in rheumatoid arthritis and Lucentis in ophthalmology
was partially offset by decreases in sales of Pegasys and Bonviva/Boniva as well as the loss of
Evista sales in Japan.
Diagnostics sales grew by 4% (CER), ahead of the market, with Professional Diagnostics being
the major contributor.
Operating results Core operating profit increased by 8% (CER) to 17.9 billion Swiss francs (+4% growth in Swiss
franc terms). The sales growth and cost savings from various global restructuring plans offset
the higher operating costs from investments in key markets as well as the impacts from price
pressure and increased competition. The core operating margin increased by 0.6 percentage
points to 38.3%.
Research and development expenditure grew by 5% (CER) to 8.7 billion Swiss francs on a core
basis, driven by investments in the oncology and neuroscience therapeutic areas. R&D costs
were 18.6% of Group sales.
IFRS operating results include non-core items of 1.5 billion Swiss francs. This includes 1.2 billion
Swiss francs for the amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and 0.5 billion
Swiss francs of income from the reversal of previous property, plant and equipment impairment.
Non-operating results Net financial expenses decreased by 0.3 billion Swiss francs to 1.7 billion Swiss francs driven
by lower interest expenses partially offset by higher net foreign exchange losses.
Net income IFRS net income increased by 22% at CER to 11.4 billion Swiss francs (+18% in Swiss franc terms),
due to the strong core operating results, lower financing costs and lower global restructuring
charges.
Core earnings per share increased by 10% in constant currencies (+6% in Swiss francs).
Cash flows Operating free cash flow of 16.4 billion Swiss francs, up 5% at CER due to higher operating
profit.
Free cash flow of 5.4 billion Swiss francs, up 6% at CER due to higher operating free cash flow
and lower interest paid.
Repayment of debt is ahead of schedule with 67% of the notes and bonds issued in 2009
to finance the Genentech transaction being repaid by the end of 2013.
Financial position Net working capital increased by 1% (CER), as higher levels of inventories due to launches
and growth of key products, higher safety stock levels and increased demand in key markets were
mostly offset by increased payables and accrued liabilities.
Net debt position improved by 3.9 billion Swiss francs to 6.7 billion Swiss francs.
Credit ratings strong: Moody’s at A1 and Standard & Poor’s at AA.
Shareholder return Dividends. A proposal will be made to increase dividends by 6% to 7.80 Swiss francs per share.
This will represent the 27th consecutive year of dividend growth and will result in a pay-out ratio
of 54.7%, subject to AGM approval.
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) was 39% representing a combined performance of share
and non-voting equity security.ROCHE GROUP

The Roche Group’s results for 2013 showed growth in its core operating activities, with sales up by 6% and core operating
profit up by 8% at constant exchange rates (CER), and sales increasing in all regions. Investments continued to develop
the product pipeline and to secure future sales growth, notably through research and development, which increased by 5%
on a core basis. The strong operating performance, combined with lower financing costs, resulted in an increase in Core EPS
of 10% at constant exchange rates. The strong operating results were also evident in the operating free cash flow, which
increased by 5% to 16.4 billion Swiss francs or 35% of sales.
Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division rose by 7%, driven by 10% growth in the oncology portfolio with significant growth in
recently launched medicines as well as established products. The key growth driver in oncology was the HER2 franchise with
Avastin, MabThera/Rituxan and Zelboraf also making significant contributions. Sales of Actemra/RoActemra and Lucentis
also increased. Key emerging markets showed growth of 12%, led by 21% sales growth in China. Diagnostics sales grew
at 4%, consolidating the division’s leading market position. The major growth area was Professional Diagnostics, while sales
in Diabetes Care declined.
Core operating profit increased by 8%, with the Pharmaceuticals Division growing at 7% and Diagnostics at 4%. In the
Pharmaceuticals Division cost of sales grew at 9% due to higher sales volumes, initial costs of implementing supply chain
strategies for future growth, compliance costs and negative exchange rate impacts. The 3% increase in marketing and
distribution costs was driven by investments to expand the business in emerging markets and to increase patient access
to medicines. In research and development the 5% increase arose mainly in the oncology and neuroscience franchises,
with the focus on new indications for recently launched products and other developments, such as PD-L1 targeted therapy
and the advancement of programmes for Alzheimer’s disease. In the Diagnostics Division profitability remained stable
as increased sales were offset by higher operating costs. These were driven by pricing impacts and growth in instrument
placements, especially in the US, higher research and development costs and the new Medical Device Tax in the US.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2013In 2013 there were two major one-off impacts in the core results. The release of previously accrued reserves for the 340B
Drug Discount Program had a positive impact of 182 million Swiss francs on US pharmaceuticals sales and 145 million Swiss
francs on core operating profit. There were also 302 million Swiss francs of income from changes to the Group’s pension
plans in the core operating profit.
During 2013 the Group has continued the implementation of a number of major restructuring initiatives to position the
business for the future. The operational closure of the Nutley site in the US, which was announced in 2012, was completed
on schedule at the end of 2013. On 14 October 2013 the Pharmaceuticals Division published details of investments to increase
its global biologic medicine manufacturing network capacity. As part of this a bulk drug production unit at the Vacaville
site in California that had been discontinued and fully written down in 2009 will be brought back into service, resulting in
a reversal of the previously incurred impairment charges of 531 million Swiss francs. The Diagnostics Division continued
the implementation of various global programmes in the Diabetes Care and Applied Science businesses to address long-
term profitability. On 23 April 2013 the Group announced that the Applied Science business area’s portfolio of products will
be integrated within the other business areas of the Diagnostics Division. Overall, the costs of the Group’s restructuring
activities in 2013 were over 1.9 billion Swiss francs lower compared to those in 2012. Impairment charges of 0.6 billion Swiss
francs were recorded for goodwill and intangible assets, notably for product intangibles in the Pharmaceuticals Division’s
hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise and goodwill in the Tissue Diagnostics business. Taken together with the growth of the
underlying business, there was an increase in IFRS net income of 22% at constant exchange rates.
Operating free cash flow was 16.4 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 5% at constant exchange rates. This increase reflects
the cash generation of both divisions, partly offset by higher capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment and
investments in intangible assets. Free cash flow was 5.4 billion Swiss francs, 6% higher than in 2012. This was primarily due
to a higher operating free cash flow and lower interest payments as the Group’s debt continues to be repaid. These were
partially offset by the higher annual dividend.
In 2013 the Swiss franc appreciated against some currencies, in particular the Japanese yen and US dollar, but weakened
against the euro. The overall impact is negative on the results expressed in Swiss francs compared to constant exchange
rates, with impacts of 3–4 percentage points on sales, core operating profit and core EPS. The exchange rates used and
currency sensitivities are given on page 34.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2013Sales
In 2013 sales increased by 6% at constant exchange rates (+3% in Swiss francs; +4% in US dollars) to 46.8 billion Swiss
francs. Sales in the Pharmaceuticals Division rose 7% with the HER2 franchise, Avastin, MabThera/Rituxan, Actemra/
RoActemra and Lucentis all growing strongly. Emerging market (E7) sales in Pharmaceuticals grew by 12%, led by 21%
growth in China, and now represent 11% of the division’s sales. The Diagnostics Division recorded sales of 10.5 billion Swiss
francs, an increase of 4% at constant exchange rates, consolidating its leading market position. The major growth area was
Professional Diagnostics, which represents more than half of the division’s sales and grew by 8%, while Diabetes Care sales
decreased by 3%.

Core operating results
The Group’s core operating profit increased by 8% at constant exchange rates (4% in Swiss francs) and the Group’s core
operating profit margin improved by 0.6 percentage points to 38.3% of sales. In 2013 there were two major one-off impacts
in the core results. There was the release of sales reserves previously accrued for the 340B Drug Discount Program in the
US which had a positive impact of 182 million Swiss francs on sales and 145 million Swiss francs on core operating profit.
There was also income of 302 million Swiss francs recorded from changes to the Group’s pension plans. At constant exchange
rates, these effects had a combined positive margin impact of 0.8 percentage points for the Group, 0.5 percentage points
for the Pharmaceuticals Division and 0.7 percentage points for the Diagnostics Division. Excluding these two factors, core
operating profit grew by 5% for the Group and the Pharmaceuticals Division and by 1% in the Diagnostics Division. Currency
translation had a negative impact of 3.4 percentage points on the operating results. There was a minor currency effect on
the Group’s core operating margin, as the positive effect of 0.3 percentage points for the Pharmaceuticals Division was offset
by a negative effect of 0.5 percentage points for the Diagnostics Division.
6
Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewPharmaceuticals Division. The division increased its core operating profit by 7% at constant exchange rates, driven by
growth of the underlying business with a 7% increase in sales. Cost of sales increased by 9% due to higher sales volumes,
initial costs of implementing supply chain strategies for future growth, compliance costs and negative exchange rate impacts.
Research and development costs increased by 5%, mainly in the oncology and neuroscience franchises, and while there
was a 4% increase of general and administration costs they were stable as a percentage of sales.
Diagnostics Division. Core operating profit increased 4%, again driven by growth of the underlying business, with
a 4% increase in sales. Cost of sales increased by 6%, more than the sales growth, due to pricing impacts. There was also
a growth in instrument placements, especially in the US. Marketing and distribution costs decreased by 2% as a result
of lower spending in the Diabetes Care and former Applied Science businesses and due to lower bad debt expenses.
Research and development costs increased by 7% due to continuing investments into next-generation platforms. General
and administration costs increased by 8% due to the costs of the new Medical Device Tax in the US and ongoing IT systems
projects. These increases were partly offset by income recorded for changes to the Group’s pension plans.
Global restructuring plans
During 2013 the Group continued with the implementation of several major global restructuring plans initiated in prior years,
notably the reorganisation of research and development in the Pharmaceuticals Division and programmes to address the
long-term profitability in the Diabetes Care and former Applied Science businesses in Diagnostics. Additionally, there was
income of 531 million Swiss francs from the reversal of previously incurred impairment charges for a bulk drug production
unit at the Vacaville site in California.

Diagnostics Division – Diabetes Care and Applied Science restructuring. On 23 April 2013 the Group announced
that the Applied Science business area’s portfolio of products will be integrated within the other business areas of the
Diagnostics Division. This will streamline decision-making and enhance technology flow from research use to the clinical
setting. On 26 September 2013 Roche Diabetes Care announced its ‘Autonomy and Speed’ initiative which will enable the
business to focus on Diabetes Care specific requirements, speed up processes and decision-making and drive efficiencies.
In 2013 total costs of 220 million Swiss francs were incurred, mainly for headcount reductions, IT-related costs and site
closure costs. In addition, goodwill impairment charges of 35 million Swiss francs were incurred for the write-off of the
goodwill from the Innovatis and 454 Life Sciences acquisitions in the former Applied Science business area.
7
Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2013Pharmaceuticals Division – Research and Development reorganisation. On 26 June 2012 the Group announced a
streamlining of the research and development activities within the Pharmaceuticals Division. The planned operational closure
of the US site in Nutley, New Jersey, was completed on schedule by the end of 2013. During 2013 total costs of 239 million
Swiss francs were incurred. These costs include additional provisions of 88 million Swiss francs to cover site running costs
until the expected divestment in 2015. There was a further impairment of 35 million Swiss francs to the carrying value of
the Nutley site, based on the most recent external property market data. Costs for other employee-related, site closure and
reorganisational matters were 116 million Swiss francs. The first results of the environmental investigations showed that
the expected cost of remediation may be lower than originally expected and accordingly the environmental provisions were
reduced by 53 million Swiss francs.
Other global restructuring plans. On 14 October 2013 the Pharmaceuticals Division announced investments to increase
its global biologic medicine manufacturing network capacity to meet the rising demand for licensed biologics and expected
pipeline growth. A part of this a bulk drug production unit at the Vacaville site in California that had been discontinued and
fully written down in 2009 will be put back into service. This resulted in income of 531 million Swiss francs from the reversal
of previously incurred impairment charges. During 2013 costs of 126 million Swiss francs were incurred for the previously
announced Operational Excellence programme, mainly for employee-related and site closure costs in the Pharmaceuticals
Division and employee-related and site closure costs in the Diagnostics Division for the sites in Burgdorf, Switzerland and
Graz, Austria. Other plans totalled 112 million Swiss francs.
Merger and acquisitions
On 1 July 2013 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Constitution Medical Investors, Inc. (‘CMI’), a US
private company based in Massachusetts. CMI is the developer of a highly innovative hematology testing system, which
is designed to provide faster and more accurate diagnosis of blood-related diseases, helping to improve patient care.
CMI is now reported in the Diagnostics operating segment as part of the Professional Diagnostics business area. The
purchase consideration was 220 million US dollars in cash and up to 255 million US dollars from a contingent consideration
arrangement.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
In 2013 impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets of 35 million Swiss francs and 12 million Swiss francs were
incurred for the Applied Science restructuring initiative described above. Based on the latest business plans prepared during
the second half of 2013, a goodwill impairment of 253 million Swiss francs was recorded in the Tissue Diagnostics business
area within the Diagnostics Division. The main factor leading to this impairment was reduced revenue expectations in the
US. These follow from recent changes in the College of American Pathologists guidelines for the use of negative reagent
controls in immunohistochemistry testing which reduced volumes and changes which reduced the reimbursement amount
to laboratories. In addition, unrelated to global restructuring, impairments totalling 286 million Swiss francs were recorded
in the Pharmaceuticals Division following a portfolio reassessment within the hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise. Further
impairment charges of 64 million Swiss francs were recorded by the Pharmaceuticals Division for various smaller projects.
Further details are given in Notes 8 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
During 2013 operating income of 302 million Swiss francs was recorded for past service costs from changes to the Group’s
pension plans in Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Germany. This represents the one-time impact of the adjustment
of the pension liability for the plan changes. Of this amount, 131 million Swiss francs were recorded in the Pharmaceuticals
Division and 67 million Swiss francs in the Diagnostics Division. The remaining 104 million Swiss francs of income were
allocated to Corporate, mainly attributable to previously divested businesses. In addition some of the US pension plans made
an offer to deferred vested members to settle part of the defined benefit obligation for a lump sum payment, which resulted
in a one-time settlement gain in the IFRS results of 19 million Swiss francs. Further details are given in Note 25 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Financial Reviewlegal and environmental settlements
In addition to the reversal of environmental remediation costs of 53 million Swiss francs for the Nutley site mentioned
above, a further 246 million Swiss francs of legal and environmental costs were recorded, unrelated to global restructuring
plans. These include a further increase of 138 million Swiss francs to the estimated remediation costs of a landfill site near
Grenzach, Germany, that was previously used by manufacturing operations that were closed some years ago.
Treasury and taxation
Financing costs were 1.6 billion Swiss francs, a decrease of 17%, with interest expenses being 23% lower at constant
exchange rates as debt was repaid. Other financial income (expense) was a net expense of 119 million Swiss francs, mainly
due to losses following the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and foreign exchange hedge costs. Core tax expenses
increased by 11% to 3.7 billion Swiss francs and the Group’s effective core tax rate was stable at 22.7% (2012: 22.6%).
The main factors were the higher percentage of core profit contribution coming from tax jurisdictions with relatively higher
local tax rates than the average Group rate, notably in the US, mostly offset by the retrospective re-enactment of the
2012 US research and development tax credit rules in January 2013.
Net income and earnings per share
IFRS net income and diluted EPS both increased by 22% at constant exchange rates driven by the strong operating
performance, significantly lower global restructuring expenses and lower financing costs. On a core basis, which excludes
non-core items such as global restructuring costs and the amortisation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets,
net income and core EPS both increased by 10%. This was driven by the strong operating performance and lower financing
costs. Core EPS grew by 7% when excluding the positive impacts from the 340B Drug Discount Program in the US and
from the changes to the Group’s pension plans.
Supplementary net income and EPS information is given on pages 144–147. This includes calculations of core EPS and
reconciles the core results to the Group’s published IFRS results.

Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc appreciated significantly against the Japanese yen. There was also
a slight appreciation against the US dollar and Brazilian real and a slight weakening against the euro. These effects resulted
in a negative translation impact on the balance sheet positions at 31 December 2013. The exchange rates used are given
on page 34.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2013In the Pharmaceuticals Division net working capital increased by 10% at constant exchange rates. This was mainly driven
by an increase of 24% in inventories due to recent and upcoming product launches and expected higher sales demand. There
were also higher levels of safety stock on selected products and temporary bridging stocks as a result of changes in supply
chain strategy. Trade receivables decreased by 2% mainly as a result of continuing strong collections, which more than offset
effects of underlying business growth. Trade payables increased by 34% following initiatives to improve cash management,
including extension of payment terms. Long-term net operating assets grew by 4% mainly due to increases in property, plant
and equipment. The main factor was biologic medicine manufacturing network investments, which resulted in an impairment
reversal of a bulk drug production unit at the Vacaville site in the US, which had previously been impaired in 2009. This was
partially offset by the impairment of intangible assets for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise.
In Diagnostics the decrease in net working capital of 13% was driven by an increase in trade payables driven by extended
payment terms as well as increased accruals, including employee benefits and lower levels of inventories. Trade receivables
were stable as decreases in European markets have been offset by increases in emerging markets, notably China. The long-
term net operating assets were stable as increases in property, plant and equipment for facilities in Germany and instrument
placements were offset by impairments of goodwill and intangible assets.
The decrease in the net debt position was mainly driven by the free cash flow of 5.4 billion Swiss francs. Transactions in
own equity to hedge the Group’s employee stock option programmes increased net debt by 1.2 billion Swiss francs while
net pension liabilities decreased by 1.1 billion Swiss francs due to changes in discount rates and the pension plan changes
referred to above. Net tax assets increased mainly due to the deferred tax effect of equity compensation plans, which
increased due to the increase in the price of the underlying equity.

The Group’s operating free cash flow for 2013 was 16.4 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 5% at constant exchange rates.
The 8% increase in core operating profit was partly offset by higher capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment
and investments in intangible assets, by the increases in net working capital noted above in the comments on the financial
position and by the higher cash utilisation of restructuring and legal provisions. There were also several non-cash items in
core net income, including the income from changes to the Group’s pension plans in 2013. The free cash flow was 5.4 billion
Swiss francs, an increase of 6% at constant exchange rates, as the higher operating free cash flow and lower interest
payments were partly offset by the higher annual dividend payments. The Group has refined the calculation of the free cash
flow in 2013 to exclude the impact of employee stock options in line with its peer group (see page 148 for further details).
Comparative 2012 free cash flow information has been restated accordingly.

Pharmaceuticals Division sales increased 7% at constant exchange rates. Growth was driven by the oncology portfolio
as well as Actemra/RoActemra and Lucentis. These increases more than offset lower sales of Pegasys, the loss of Chugai’s
Evista sales following the termination of a co-marketing agreement in Japan and the expected further decline in Bonviva/
Boniva. Sales growth was primarily driven by the HER2 franchise, Avastin, MabThera/Rituxan, Actemra/RoActemra and
Lucentis. These main growth drivers represent 62% of the portfolio (2012: 59%) and together generated 1.8 billion Swiss
francs of additional sales in 2013. Sales in the US benefited from the release of previously accrued reserves under the 340B
Drug Discount Program of 182 million Swiss francs, more than half of which were for MabThera/Rituxan.
In oncology, demand for established products grew due to expanded use in existing indications. Furthermore, growth
was driven by the HER2 franchise following additional approvals for Perjeta and the launch of Kadcyla in the US and Europe.
Zelboraf also continued to be a significant growth contributor. Sales in immunology increased due to strong growth of
Actemra/RoActemra in all regions, reflecting the strong uptake of Actemra as a monotherapy treatment, and also due
to growth of MabThera/Rituxan in rheumatoid arthritis. There was continued growth in ophthalmology as Lucentis sales
benefited from the approval of a less frequent dosing regimen in wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) as
well as increased sales in retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and diabetic macular edema (DME).
All geographic data in the following sales tables is presented using the new organisational structure of the Pharmaceuticals
Division (see Investor Update from 21 March 2013).

MabThera/Rituxan. For non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
as well as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Global sales growth was driven by
increased use across all oncology and rheumatoid arthritis indications. Sales growth in the oncology franchise was 5% and
in the RA franchise sales grew by 12%. US sales were 3.3 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 8%, benefiting from the release
of sales reserves for the 340B Program. Excluding this impact of 99 million Swiss francs, US sales rose by 5%. Sales rose
6% in the International region with growth in China from increased demand for treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
(a type of NHL).

Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewHER2 franchise (Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla). For HER2-positive breast cancer and HER2-positive metastatic
(advanced) gastric cancer. Herceptin sales grew in the US (+9%) and in the International region (+11%). Excluding the
release of sales reserves of 41 million Swiss francs from the 340B Program, US sales rose 6%. US growth resulted from
increased usage in both breast and gastric cancer. The International region grew in all sub-regions. Asia grew as a result
of the breast cancer patient access programme and HER2 testing initiatives, and sales in Latin America increased in both
private and public sectors. European sales were stable while sales in Japan grew by 8%. The recently launched Perjeta and
Kadcyla continued to be growth drivers with strong uptake and recognised benefits compared to other treatment regimens.
In total, the HER2 franchise grew by 14%.

Avastin. For advanced colorectal, breast, lung, kidney and ovarian cancer, and for relapsed glioblastoma (a type of brain
tumour). Global sales grew by 13%, mainly due to increased use in established indications (colorectal, lung and breast
cancer) as well as in the newer indication of ovarian cancer. Ovarian and colorectal cancer indications were the main
drivers behind the 14% sales increase in Europe. Avastin sales in the US grew 5% as a result of expanded use in colorectal
cancer and also benefited from the release of 340B Program sales reserves. Excluding this impact of 31 million Swiss francs,
US sales rose 4%. Growth in the International region was 30%, with higher sales in Latin America driven by increased use
in colorectal and ovarian cancer indications in Brazil. There were also higher sales in the Asia sub-region, with China growing
at 62%, driven by the colorectal cancer indication. The growth in Japan of 15% was primarily due to use in colorectal, breast
and lung cancer.

Tarceva. For advanced non-small cell lung (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer. Sales rose by 4%, with growth in US, China
and Japan. Growth resulted from the approval and penetration in the first-line epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
mutation-positive NSCLC indication. In Europe this partially compensated for a decrease in patient share in second-line
NSCLC. In the International region, growth in Asia was supported by additional reimbursement approvals.

Pegasys. For hepatitis B and C. Sales decreased by 19%, mainly in the US and Europe, due to further treatment deferrals
in anticipation of the expected launch of interferon-free combination therapies. In the International region, there was growth
in Asia (+3%) due to expanding access to patients and from markets where first-generation triple therapies have been
recently launched.

arthritis. Sales continued to grow in all approved indications and in all regions as a result of the continued strong uptake as
a monotherapy in rheumatoid arthritis. Sales were over 1 billion Swiss francs with increases particularly in the US and Europe,
where Actemra/RoActemra continues to gain market share. Marketing and reimbursement approvals in additional countries
continue to expand patient access to Actemra/RoActemra. Actemra subcutaneous formulation was approved in Japan
during March and in the US during October, for adults living with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis.

Anemia franchise (NeoRecormon/Epogin and Mircera). For anemia/renal anemia. In a declining and highly competitive
market combined sales of Roche’s NeoRecormon and Chugai’s Epogin (epoetin beta) declined 18%. The sustained decline
in sales of NeoRecormon and Epogin was partly offset by growth in sales of the longer-acting erythropoiesis-stimulating
agent Mircera, which rose 24% to 425 million Swiss francs. Much of this growth was due to the increasing number of
patients switching to, or starting treatment with, Mircera in place of NeoRecormon/Epogin. The strongest contributions
to higher Mircera sales came from Japan.

due to the delay of generic competition entering the market, and growth in Japan offsetting the continued decline in Europe
following patent expiry. Continued growth in Japan reflects the position of CellCept as the standard of care ahead of the
launch of generics that became available by the end of 2013.

Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewUnited States. Sales grew by 10% in US dollar terms, or 9% excluding the impact of the reserves release for the 340B Drug
Discount Program. The leading products were the oncology medicines MabThera/Rituxan, Avastin and the HER2 franchise,
with sales of 3.3 billion Swiss francs (+8%), 2.6 billion Swiss francs (+5%) and 2.2 billion Swiss francs (+31%), respectively.
Of the other products, the main growth drivers were Lucentis, Activase/TNKase, Xolair, Tamiflu and Actemra/RoActemra.
Gazyva received approval in November 2013 for previously untreated chronic, lymphocytic leukemia and sales for the
remainder of 2013 were 3 million Swiss francs.
Europe. Sales increased by 2% at constant exchange rates, despite being impacted by pricing pressures. Growth was
mainly driven by oncology products with Avastin (+14%), Zelboraf (+65%), Perjeta (over +500%) and MabThera/Rituxan
(+3%). In addition there was continued sales growth of Actemra/RoActemra (+27%). These were partially offset by lower
NeoRecormon and Bonviva/Boniva sales.
Japan. Sales grew by 2% in Japanese yen terms. Results in Japan were impacted by the loss of Evista sales following the
termination of a co-marketing agreement, which had a negative impact of 5 percentage points on sales growth. The major
growth drivers were Avastin with sales of 717 million Swiss francs (+15%) and Edirol with 181 million Swiss francs (+82%).
There was also growth in Actemra/RoActemra (+21%), Herceptin (+8%), MabThera/Rituxan (+6%) and from recently
launched Perjeta and Bonviva/Boniva.
International. Sales increased by 8% at constant exchange rates, driven by the Asia–Pacific and Latin America sub-regions.
Growth in Asia–Pacific was mainly due to the oncology products, especially Herceptin (+21%), Avastin (+35%), MabThera/
Rituxan (+13%) and Xeloda (+13%). China was the main driver in this region, with overall sales growth of 21%. In Latin
America sales growth was driven by Avastin, Herceptin and Actemra, despite pricing pressure and political uncertainties.
For the sub-region EEMEA, sales grew as underlying growth offset timing delays in some tender sales. Sales in this region
were also negatively impacted by political instability in several markets.

Total sales in the E7 key emerging markets grew by 12%. The sales growth was led by China, with a substantial contribution
from Brazil. The 21% growth in China reflects the efforts being made to expand patient access to medicines and the investment
strategy to expand the geographical coverage of medical care. The growth in Brazil resulted from the inclusion of several
key products into the reimbursement scope for public healthcare provision. Sales declined in Mexico due to delays in market
approvals and public sector purchases, while the growth in Turkey was a result of strong sales of key oncology products.

Royalties and other operating income. The decrease of 3% at constant exchange rates was due to lower income from
disposal of products, which was lower than 2012 due to four large transactions in that year. There was an increase in royalty
income in Japan in 2013 and increased royalties elsewhere from higher sales of out-licensed products such as Humira and
Enbrel. These were partly offset by milestone income for Eylea and the base effect of back royalty income of 27 million Swiss
francs received in 2012. The increase in out-licensing income was mainly due to out-licensing agreements in Japan.

Cost of sales. Core costs increased by 9% at constant exchange rates mainly due to higher sales volumes, the initial
costs of implementing supply chain strategies for future growth, compliance costs and negative exchange rate impacts.
As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased slightly to 20.2% from 20.1%. Royalty expenses were 10% higher driven
by the newly launched oncology products and by increased sales of Avastin and Tamiflu. In addition there were back
royalty expenses of 42 million Swiss francs due to the latest developments in the Sanofi arbitration (see also Note 19 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements). Expenses from collaboration and profit-sharing agreements increased mainly
driven by higher co-promotion expenses. This was as a result of higher sales of MabThera/Rituxan, including those related
to the release of the 340B Program sales reserves, and increased sales of Xolair and Tarceva. The net income from
global restructuring plans was due to 531 million Swiss francs from the reversal of previously incurred impairment charges
for a bulk drug production unit at the Vacaville site in California (see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewMarketing and distribution. Core costs increased at constant exchange rates by 3%, with the percentage of sales ratio
improving to 16.0% from 16.6%. Sales and marketing efforts focussed on continued business expansion and increasing patient
access to medicines, in particular in emerging markets such as Asia. Significant investments were also made to support

Research and development. Core costs increased by 5% at constant exchange rates but as a percentage of sales
decreased to 21.2% from 21.4%. There were increased investments in the oncology and neuroscience therapeutic areas.
In oncology additional activities were focussed on new indications for recently launched products and other developments,
such as PD-L1 targeted therapy. The progression of programmes for Alzheimer’s disease was the main area of increased
activity in the neuroscience area. These were partially offset by lower spending in other therapeutic areas such as
cardiovascular and inflammation, with the discontinuation of inflammation research in Nutley. In addition the Pharmaceuticals
Division capitalised 366 million Swiss francs (2012: 209 million Swiss francs) as intangible assets for the in-licensing of
pipeline compounds and technologies. The impairments of intangible assets include 286 million Swiss francs following
a portfolio reassessment within the hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise and a further 64 million Swiss francs in respect of other
projects. Amortisation of intangible assets increased due to recent investments. Global restructuring costs of 101 million
Swiss francs were recorded, consisting mainly of employee-related costs and outside services for the closure of the
Nutley site.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2013General and administration. Core costs increased by 4% at constant exchange rates but were largely stable as a
percentage of sales at 2.9% (2012: 3.0%). This includes the beneficial impact of 131 million Swiss francs of income from
changes in the Group’s pension plans. The increase in administration costs was mainly a result of a shift of finance headcount
from Corporate. There was also an increase in business taxes, including the costs for the US Branded Pharmaceutical
Product Fee of 175 million Swiss francs (2012: 163 million Swiss francs). Global restructuring costs mainly include site closure
costs for Nutley, consisting of employee-related costs, property taxes and outside services and provisions of 88 million Swiss
francs to cover site running costs until the expected divestment in 2015. Legal and environmental settlement costs mainly
relate to the legal matters described in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pharmaceuticals Division total core operating profit and operating profit both include the elimination of 157 million Swiss francs (2012: 38 million Swiss francs) of
unrealised inter-company profits between Roche Pharmaceuticals and Chugai.
Sales and core operating profit of Roche Pharmaceuticals increased significantly with under-proportional cost growth in
marketing and distribution and in research and development combined with stable general and administration costs. The fall
in the exchange rate of the Japanese yen has a negative impact of approximately 20% on the Chugai results when expressed
in Swiss francs. Chugai’s core operating profit increased by 2%, in line with the increase in sales to third parties. Gross profit
from sales was up driven by higher domestic sales despite the loss of Evista sales. Income from out-licensing agreements
and royalties increased significantly. Operating expenses grew mainly due to increased R&D activities and higher M&D
spend mainly driven by product launches. The operating free cash flow at Chugai decreased mainly as a result of net working
capital movements with a significant increase in inventories for safety stocks and decrease in accounts payable driven by
the timing of material purchases from Roche Pharmaceuticals.

The absolute amount of the movement between the 2013 and 2012 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2013 transactions
(translated at average rates for 2012) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2013 transactions include non-cash movements
and therefore the movements in this table are not the same as amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only includes the cash movements). A full
consolidated balance sheet is given on page 49 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given
above is on page 149.
Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc appreciated
significantly against the Japanese yen. There was also an appreciation against the US dollar and the Brazilian real.
These effects resulted overall in a negative translation impact on balance sheet positions of 1,140 million Swiss francs
by 31 December 2013. The exchange rates used are given on page 34.
Net working capital. The increase of 5% in net trade working capital at constant exchange rates was due to increases
in inventories of 24%, partly offset by reductions in trade receivables and an increase in trade payables. There were higher
levels of inventories for recent and upcoming product launches such as Actemra/RoActemra and Herceptin subcutaneous
(SC) formulations, Kadcyla and Perjeta and also expected higher sales demand of established products. There were also
increases in safety stocks for selected existing products and temporary bridging stocks as a result of changes in supply
chain strategy. Trade receivables decreased by 2% despite the 2013 sales increase, as a result of continuing strong
collections notably in the Europe and EEMEA regions. Trade payables increased by 34% following initiatives to improve cash
management including extension of payment terms. There was a decrease of 2% in the net liability for other receivables/
payables due mainly to an increase in prepaid expenses and royalty receivables.
long-term net operating assets. These increased by 6% as an increase in property, plant and equipment and lower
provisions were only partially offset by a decrease in intangible assets. The movement in property, plant and equipment was
mainly attributable to the capital expenditure projects described below in the free cash flow section and the impairment
reversal for a bulk drug production unit at the Vacaville site in the US. Intangible assets decreased due to impairments
following a portfolio reassessment within the hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise and other impairments. Provisions decreased
due to the utilisation of restructuring and legal provisions. In addition the Nutley environmental provision was transferred
from the Pharmaceuticals Division to Corporate as it is being managed centrally with the planned site divestment.

1) A detailed breakdown is provided on page 148.
The Pharmaceuticals Division’s operating free cash flow increased by 5% at constant exchange rates to 15.0 billion Swiss
francs. The increased cash generation from the underlying business, represented by the 7% growth in core operating profit,
was partly used by the increases in net working capital noted above in the comments on the financial position. Operating
profit, net of cash adjustments, also increased by 7% as the adjustment for various non-cash items in the core results largely
offset each other.
Capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment relates to investments in efficiency improvements in manufacturing
facilities and increased production capacity, in particular in the US. There was also the transfer of functions from the Nutley
site to other locations, infrastructure expansion resulting from business growth in Asia and increased expenditure for the site
developments in Basel.

Sales
Diagnostics Division sales grew ahead of the global in vitro diagnostics market, with all regions contributing to sales growth
of 4% at constant exchange rates to 10.5 billion Swiss francs. This growth was predominantly driven by continued strong
demand for immunoassays and platforms used in clinical laboratories from Roche’s Professional Diagnostics business
area and regionally by emerging markets. Diabetes Care sales decreased by 3% due to continued market challenges and
reimbursement changes in blood glucose monitoring in some key markets, notably the US. Molecular Diagnostics grew 2%,
with continued strong uptake of the HPV test in the US. The main growth drivers were blood screening products returning
to growth, as well as world-wide growth of oncology tests and nucleic acid purification (NAP) products for life sciences.
Tissue Diagnostics sales increased 7%, with above market growth in all regions except in the US, which grew at a lower
rate due to reimbursement and guidelines changes.
25
Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2013On 23 April 2013 the Group announced that the Applied Science business area’s portfolio of products would be integrated
within the Group’s other Diagnostics business areas. The polymerase chain reaction technology (PCR), the nucleic acid
purification (NAP) and biochemical reagents lines are now managed by Molecular Diagnostics. The Custom Biotech
portfolio has moved to Professional Diagnostics. A dedicated unit has been established to focus solely on sequencing.
Sales information has been reclassified retrospectively, and the sales of the sequencing business are reported as part of
the results for Molecular Diagnostics. Total divisional sales are unchanged.

Professional Diagnostics. Sales grew above the respective market and further extended Roche’s position as market leader.
The strong growth was driven by the immunoassay (+14%) and clinical chemistry (+6%) businesses. Coagulation patient
self-monitoring (+7%) and hematology (+9%) also contributed to this good performance.
All regions achieved sales growth, with the Asia–Pacific region being the main regional growth driver (+17%), while sales
in the smaller Latin America region also grew by 17%. In North America sales increased by 7%, with the cobas 6000 and
cobas 8000 product lines and automation solutions as the main contributors. In the EMEA region sales grew by 3%, mainly
due to immunoassay tests and clinical chemistry products. The coagulation patient self-monitoring business had strong
growth in North America. In Japan sales grew 4%. The immunoassay business continued its growth and contributed to
a quarter of the division’s total sales. Tests for markers for oncology, thyroid disorders, cardiac diseases, women’s health
(including vitamin D) and infectious diseases make up the majority of immunoassay sales. The hematology business showed
strong growth momentum in Russia and Latin America.
A key milestone for the business area was the launch of the new cobas 8100 instrument. This fully automated workflow series
for managing numerous routine laboratory tasks simplifies operations for customers, reducing manual handling of samples
and increases cost-efficiencies while processing urgent samples at more than twice the speed of the earlier version of this
system. The system is available globally, except in the US, and since its launch it has achieved a good market uptake.
Due to the reorganisation of the former Applied Science business area the Custom Biotech portfolio is now part of
the Professional Diagnostics business area and this is reflected in the comparative information.

Diabetes Care. The 3% decrease in sales reflects reimbursement cuts for blood glucose monitoring supplies, especially
in the US, and ongoing price pressure in other key markets. There was continued competition from low-cost providers.
Sales decreased in North America by 15% due to reimbursement cuts for some important segments of the US market.
The business grew in Asia–Pacific (+4%) and Latin America (+2%), while sales were stable in EMEA (0%), where several
countries were affected by low-cost providers. Sales in Japan were 3% lower.
Sales of the Accu-Chek Mobile, targeted for more frequent testers, grew by 41%, whereas sales of old-generation Accu-
Chek Compact and Advantage meters continued to decline. Sales of insulin delivery systems grew by 1%. The 1–2% growth
in blood glucose monitoring (bGM) strip volumes and meters placements were more than offset by continuing price
pressures in the bGM sector, in total leading to a 3% decline in global sales in the Diabetes Care business.
The business continued market launches of next-generation versions of existing brands such as the Accu-Chek Active and
the Accu-Chek Aviva/Performa meters, and received FDA clearance for the Accu-Chek Aviva Expert system in the US.
The Accu-Chek Active meter and the next-generation no-code Accu-Chek Aviva/Performa meter were launched in the third
quarter of 2013 globally, except in the US where the no-code Accu-Chek Nano SmartView meter and test strips have already
been available since 2012.
In 2012 Roche Diabetes Care initiated a restructuring, notably of research and development activities but also including some
marketing and manufacturing activities, to sustain long-term profitability. Further restructuring steps were taken in 2013 and
these activities will continue into 2014.

Molecular Diagnostics. The underlying growth of the Molecular Diagnostics business was 6%, excluding sequencing sales.
The main contributors were tests for the human papilloma virus (HPV) (+90%), nucleic acid purification (NAP)/real-time PCR
(qPCR) reagents and systems in the life sciences market (+6%) and products for blood screening (+2%). Sales growth was
reported by all regions, with North America being the main growth driver for HPV test sales and blood screening. Sales for
blood screening also grew in Asia–Pacific. The EMEA region had sales growth of NAP/qPCR reagents and led the growth in
sales of oncology companion tests. In Japan sales grew by 1%.
Sales for blood screening, which represents a significant proportion of the business area’s total sales, showed a return
to growth in the second half of 2013 as the impacts of timing differences and ordering patterns seen in the first half of
the year were normalised. Sales of oncology companion diagnostic tests, an area of high medical value, also showed
significant growth.

Tissue Diagnostics. Sales growth was mainly due to the advanced staining reagents business, with all regions recording
sales growth. In North America sales increased by 1%, which was lower than global growth due to recent changes in US
guidelines and reimbursements (see below). There was 19% sales growth outside the US, with Asia–Pacific reporting 34%
sales growth in advanced staining, notably from China, Australia and South Korea. In EMEA the sales increase of 14% was
due to strong growth in reagent sales and new primary staining instrument sales. Sales for primary staining were up 12%,
with a strong contribution from the special stains business. Revenues from external personalised healthcare partners and
sales of companion tests continued to grow. The CINtec PLUS Cytology test, a fully automated cell-based assay used in
cervical cancer screening, obtained a CE Mark in December.
Based on the latest business plans prepared during the second half of 2013, a goodwill impairment of 253 million Swiss
francs was recorded in the Tissue Diagnostics business within the Diagnostics Division. The main factor leading to
this impairment was reduced revenue expectations in the US. These follow recent changes in the College of American
Pathologists guidelines for the use of negative reagent controls in immunohistochemistry testing which reduced volumes
and changes which reduced the reimbursement amount to laboratories.

Divisional sales growth was primarily driven by the Asia–Pacific, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Latin America
regions. Demand was particularly high in China, where sales rose 27%. The immunodiagnostics and clinical chemistry
reagents were the key growth drivers in the Asia–Pacific region. Sales growth in the EMEA region was led by Professional
Diagnostics, with Tissue Diagnostics also contributing. In Latin America, Professional Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics
and Tissue Diagnostics all showed solid growth. In North America sales grew 1% with strong US sales growth in
immunoassays, coagulation monitoring and molecular diagnostics, in particular the HPV and blood screening businesses.
This growth in the US was offset by a sales decline in Diabetes Care due to significant cuts in reimbursement. Immunoassay
sales, which grew by 9%, were the largest contributor to growth in Japan.

All E7 markets contributed to the sales growth mainly in the Professional and Tissue Diagnostics business areas. In Brazil
the division reinforced its market leadership in the IVD market. In South Korea growth was driven by commercial laboratory
automation projects for Professional and Tissue Diagnostics, which enhanced testing efficiency at customer sites. With the
ongoing focus on innovative and safe blood testing for patients across the whole of India, the division has more than doubled
the sites for nucleic acid tests (NAT) resulting in growth in Molecular Diagnostics.

Royalties and other operating income. The decrease of 13% at constant exchange rates was driven by lower royalty
income. This was mainly the result of back royalty payments of 15 million Swiss francs received in 2012 which did not reoccur
in 2013.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2013Cost of sales. Core costs increased by 6% at constant exchange rates due to an increase in manufacturing cost of goods
sold and period costs of 6%. Overall, the growth in core costs was higher than the sales growth due to pricing impacts.
There was also a growth in instrument placements, especially in the US, and increased diabetes meter placements. This
increase was partially offset by a one-time VAT refund in 2013 of 45 million Swiss francs related to meter placements in prior
years. This resulted in a cost of sales ratio of 43.3% compared to 42.3% in 2012. Global restructuring costs were mainly due
to the reorganisation of the former Applied Science business and for the closure of the sites at Graz, Austria and Burgdorf,
Switzerland. Amortisation of product intangibles decreased as some intangible assets became fully amortised.

Marketing and distribution. Core costs decreased by 2% at constant exchange rates due to lower spending in Diabetes
Care and the former Applied Science business following the restructuring initiatives. Bad debt expenses were also lower.
The decreases were partially offset by increased spending for sales force and distribution in Professional Diagnostics and
Molecular Diagnostics. In the Asia–Pacific and Latin America regions marketing and distribution costs increased due to sales
force expansion to further penetrate emerging markets. This was more than offset by lower spending in the EMEA region.
On a core basis, marketing and distribution costs as a percentage of sales were 23.3% compared to 24.7% in 2012. Global
restructuring costs were mainly due to the reorganisations in the Diabetes Care and former Applied Science businesses
to improve the efficiency of marketing and distribution activities.

Research and development. Core costs increased by 7% at constant exchange rates, driven by increased spending
for instrument development costs for major platforms in Professional and Molecular Diagnostics. Furthermore research
and development costs increased due to the acquisition of Constitution Medical Investors, Inc. in Boston, US. In the former
Applied Science business expenses declined significantly as a result of ongoing restructuring. In Diabetes Care costs
remained stable as a result of cost containment programmes initiated in 2012. As a percentage of sales, research and
development core costs increased to 9.7% from 9.2%. Global restructuring costs were mainly related to the reorganisation
in the Applied Science business and to the closure of the site in Graz, Austria. Intangible asset impairments of 12 million
Swiss francs were incurred as part of this reorganisation.

General and administration. Core costs increased 8% at constant exchange rates. The increase in administration costs
was due to higher employee costs in Professional Diagnostics for staffing global projects, ramping up new and developing
affiliates, as well as increases in certain legal costs. Business taxes increased due to the new US Medical Device Tax with
costs of 24 million Swiss francs. Other general items include several ongoing IT systems projects to standardise, automate
and centralise business processes. These increases were offset by income of 67 million Swiss francs recorded for changes
in some of the Group’s pension plans. As a percentage of sales, core costs increased to 4.1% from 3.9% in 2012. Global
restructuring costs were mainly due to global IT projects and employee-related costs from the reorganisation of the former
Applied Science business. In addition, goodwill impairment charges of 253 million Swiss francs were recorded in the Tissue
Diagnostics business and 35 million Swiss francs were incurred for the write-off of the goodwill from the 454 Life Sciences
and Innovatis acquisitions in the former Applied Science business.

The absolute amount of the movement between the 2013 and 2012 consolidated balances reported in Swiss francs is split between actual 2013 transactions
(translated at average rates for 2012) and the currency translation adjustment (CTA) that arises on consolidation. The 2013 transactions include non-cash movements
and therefore the movements in this table are not the same as amounts shown in the operating free cash flow (which only include the cash movements). A full
consolidated balance sheet is given on page 49 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and a reconciliation between that balance sheet and the information given
above is on page 149.
31
Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2013Currency translation effects on balance sheet amounts. Compared to the start of the year the Swiss franc appreciated
against the US dollar and slightly weakened against the euro. These effects resulted overall in a negative translation impact
on balance sheet positions of 310 million Swiss francs by 31 December 2013. As the Diagnostics Division does not have
a significant net asset position in Japanese yen, the appreciation of the Swiss franc against the Japanese yen had only a minor
impact. The exchange rates used are given on page 34.
Net working capital. Net trade working capital decreased by 7%, driven by an increase in trade payables and a decrease
in inventories. Trade payables increased by 51% due to extended payment terms. Inventories decreased by 5% due to
increased inventory provisions. Trade receivables were stable as high collections were partially offset by increases following
from the growth of the business in emerging markets, notably China. There was an increase of 11% in the net liability for
other receivables/payables. The main factor behind the increase in other receivables/payables was higher accruals, including
for employee benefits, which was partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses.
long-term net operating assets. These remained stable at constant exchange rates. The decrease in intangible assets
was offset by increases in investments in property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment increased by 4%
due to higher instrument placements and site expenditure in Germany. Goodwill and intangible assets decreased due to
impairments in Tissue Diagnostics and the former Applied Science business area. This was partially offset by the acquisition
of the Constitution Medical Investors, Inc. in the US. Provisions decreased by 1% due to a net utilisation of restructuring
provisions.

The operating free cash flow of the Diagnostics Division increased by 9% to 2.0 billion Swiss francs. The cash generation of
the business was supported by a decrease in net working capital in 2013, mainly due to increases in payables as noted above
in the comments on the financial position.
Operating profit, net of cash adjustments, decreased by 4% while core operating profit increased by 4%. This difference was
due to several non-cash items, including the income from changes in the Group’s pension plans in 2013, the cash utilisation
of restructuring provisions and lower bad debt expenses.
Capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment of 1.1 billion Swiss francs results from investment in facilities in Germany
and for instrument placements, particularly in China, the US and Germany.

General and administration core costs decreased by 26% at constant exchange rates due to the positive impact of 104 million
Swiss francs recorded for changes in some of the Group’s pension plans, which were mainly attributable to previously
divested businesses. Administration expenses decreased by 12%, mainly due to a shift of headcount to the Pharmaceuticals
Division. The increase in other general items was driven by costs related to ongoing IT systems projects. Total costs on an
IFRS basis decreased by 41%. Environmental expenses included a further increase in the estimated costs for the remediation
of a landfill site in Grenzach, Germany of 138 million Swiss francs. This was partly offset by the release of 53 million Swiss
francs for environmental remediation provisions for the Nutley site in the US.
Corporate operating free cash flow showed a higher outflow due to a reduction in accounts payable, notably in accruals
for employee benefits. The major reason for the decrease in the core costs was the non-cash income from changes in
the Group’s pension plans.

In 2013 compared to 2012, the Swiss franc was stronger against many currencies, in particular the Japanese yen and also
the US dollar, but weakened against some others, notably the euro. The overall impact was negative on the income statement
and free cash flow results expressed in Swiss francs compared to constant exchange rates. For sales, these developments
resulted in a negative impact of 3 percentage points, equivalent to 1.5 billion Swiss francs when translated into Swiss francs.
The currency translation exposure for the operating profit is mitigated by the Group having the majority of its cost base
located outside of Switzerland. The sensitivity of Group sales and core operating profit in absolute terms to a 1% movement
in average foreign currency exchange rates against the Swiss franc during the 2013 is shown in the table below.

The Group’s revenues are primarily generated from sales of products to customers. Such revenues are mainly received in the
local currency of the customer’s home market, although in certain emerging markets invoicing is made in major international
currencies such as the US dollar and euro. The costs of sales and marketing and also some administration costs follow the same
currency pattern as sales. The majority of research and development activities are incurred at the Group’s global research
facilities, and therefore the costs are mainly concentrated in US dollars, Swiss francs and euros. General and administration
costs tend to be incurred mainly at central locations in the US, Switzerland and Germany. Obviously the large majority of
Chugai’s costs are denominated in Japanese yen.

35
Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2013Financing costs
Financing costs were 1,580 million Swiss francs, a decrease of 343 million Swiss francs or 17% compared to 2012. The main
driver was a decrease of 23% in interest expense which reflects the continued repayment of the debt incurred to finance the
Genentech transaction. The loss on early redemption of debt was 248 million Swiss francs, compared with 259 million Swiss
francs in 2012. The net interest cost of pension plans remained stable at 227 million Swiss francs. A full analysis of financing
costs is given in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other financial income (expense)
Other financial income (expense) was a net expense of 119 million Swiss francs. Net income from equity securities was
42 million Swiss francs, an increase of 13%. Interest income and income from debt securities decreased by 13% to 27 million
Swiss francs due to short-term interest rates remaining at low levels in major markets. The foreign exchange result mainly
reflects hedging costs and was a loss of 174 million Swiss francs compared to a loss of 89 million Swiss francs in 2012. The
foreign exchange result in 2013 included a loss of 45 million Swiss francs following the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar
in February 2013 and 34 million Swiss francs on losses on hedges of the Group’s euro/Swiss franc position. A full analysis
of other financial income (expense) is given in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and details of the Group’s
hedging arrangement are given in Note 29.
Income taxes
The Group’s effective core tax rate was stable at 22.7% (2012: 22.6%). The higher percentage of core profit contribution
coming from tax jurisdictions with relatively higher local tax rates than the average Group rate, notably in the US, increased
the effective tax rate. This was mostly offset by the retrospective re-enactment of the 2012 US research and development
tax credits in January 2013, which means that the 2013 results include a whole year of tax credits in respect of 2012 as well
as tax credits for 2013.
A tax benefit of 375 million Swiss francs was recorded in 2013 for the non-core items compared to a tax benefit of 930 million
Swiss francs in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to the lower underlying non-core expenses compared to 2012, specifically
from global restructuring plans including intangible asset impairments as well as lower legal and environmental costs.
Full details of the Group’s income tax positions are given in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financial position
The decrease in the net debt position was mainly driven by the free cash flow of 5.4 billion Swiss francs. Transactions in
own equity to hedge the Group’s employee stock option programmes increased net debt by 1.2 billion Swiss francs while
net pension liabilities decreased by 1.1 billion Swiss francs due to changes in discount rates and changes in the plan rules
of some of the Group’s pension plans. Net tax assets increased mainly due to the deferred tax effect of equity compensation
plans, which increased due to the increase in the price of the underlying equity. Interest payable relates mostly to bonds
and notes with coupon payment dates in March and September, and the decline was due to the continued repayment
of the underlying debt. At 31 December 2013 the Group held financial long-term assets with a market value of 0.3 billion
Swiss francs, which consist mostly of holdings in biotechnology companies which were acquired in the context of licensing
transactions or scientific collaborations.
36
Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewFree cash flow
The cash outflow from treasury activities decreased to 1.3 billion Swiss francs mostly due to lower interest payments.
Total taxes paid in 2013 were 3.3 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 3% at constant exchange rates, due to higher tax
payments in the US in 2013, partially offset by a base effect from the settlement of certain outstanding tax positions in
2012. Total dividends paid in 2013 were 6.4 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 0.5 billion Swiss francs compared to 2012,
reflecting the 8% increase in the Roche Group dividend.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2013Operating free cash flow increased by 5% at constant exchange rates to 16.4 billion Swiss francs, driven by the strong growth
of the underlying operating business with core operating profit growth of 8%. There were increases in net working capital,
mainly inventories, and capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and investment in intangible assets were higher
than in 2012. In both divisions the increased cash generated by the business was partly absorbed by the cash utilisation of
restructuring and legal provisions.
The cash outflow from treasury activities decreased to 1.3 billion Swiss francs mostly due to lower interest payments.
Total taxes paid were 3.3 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 3% at constant exchange rates, due to higher tax payments in
the US partially offset by the base effect of the settlement of certain outstanding tax positions in 2012. Total dividends paid
were higher due to the 8% increase of the annual Roche Group dividend.
Free cash flow of 5.4 billion Swiss francs was 6% higher at constant exchange rates, mainly due to increased operating free
cash flow and lower interest payments which were partly offset by higher dividend payments in 2013.
The Group has refined the calculation of the free cash flow in 2013 to exclude the impact of employee stock options, in line
with its peer group (see page 148 for further details). Comparative 2012 free cash flow information has been restated
accordingly.

1) US dollar-denominated debt includes those bonds and notes denominated in euros, Swiss francs and pounds sterling that were swapped into US dollars,
and therefore in the financial statements have economic characteristics equivalent to US dollar-denominated bonds and notes.
The net debt position of the Group at 31 December 2013 was 6.7 billion Swiss francs, a decrease of 3.9 billion Swiss francs
from 31 December 2012. The decrease in net debt was mainly due to the free cash flow of 5.4 billion Swiss francs described
above, which includes dividend payments of 6.4 billion Swiss francs. Transactions in own equity to hedge the Group’s
employee stock option programmes increased net debt by 1.2 billion Swiss francs.
In 2009 the Group entered into derivative contracts with third parties to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from bonds
and notes issued in currencies other than US dollar. At the same time collateral agreements were entered with the derivative
counterparties to mitigate counterparty risk. As the fair value of derivative hedging instruments increased due to the
strengthening of the euro against the US dollar during 2013, cash collateral of 0.1 billion Swiss francs was received by Roche.
The collateral balance in relation to the hedges on the non-US dollar-denominated bonds and notes is mainly sensitive
to the foreign exchange rate between the US dollar and the euro, but also to pound sterling. Currently the collateral balance
moves by approximately 55 million US dollars if all of these foreign exchange rates move by 1% simultaneously.
The redemption and repurchase of bonds and notes during 2013 (see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements)
had an impact on liquid funds, but had no impact on the net debt position.
Full details of the Group’s marketable securities, cash and debt positions are given in Notes 12, 13 and 20 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed contributions
into a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive obligation to pay
further contributions. In 2013 expenses for the Group’s defined contribution plans were 343 million Swiss francs (2012:
313 million Swiss francs).
All other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’, even if the Group’s potential obligation is minor or has a relatively
remote possibility of arising. Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by payments
from the Group and by employees, but in some cases the plan is unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees
directly from its own financial resources.
39
Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2013Defined benefit plans
Expenses for the Group’s defined benefit plans were 329 million Swiss francs (2012: 506 million Swiss francs). The decrease
was mainly due to past service income of 302 million Swiss francs and settlement income of 19 million Swiss francs, as
described below. These were partially offset by an increase in the current service cost of 72 million Swiss francs driven
by lower discount rates at the beginning of 2013 compared to the beginning of 2012. These expenses take into account the
implementation of IAS 19 (revised) which increased the net interest cost of pensions in 2012 by 164 million Swiss francs
and in 2013 by approximately the same amount. Based on the revised actuarial assumptions at the end of 2013, expenses
for the Group’s defined benefit plans in 2014 are expected to be approximately 564 million Swiss francs. These estimates for
2014 pension expenses do not include any settlement or past service/curtailment effects that might arise during the year.
During 2013 operating income of 302 million Swiss francs was recorded for past service costs from changes to the Group’s
pension plans in Switzerland, the UK and Germany. This represents the one-time impact of the adjustment of the pension
liability for the plan changes. Of this amount, 131 million Swiss francs were recorded in the Pharmaceuticals Division and
67 million Swiss francs in the Diagnostics Division. The remaining 104 million Swiss francs of income were allocated to
Corporate, mainly attributable to previously divested businesses. In addition some of the US pension plans made an offer
to deferred vested members to settle part of the defined benefit obligation for a lump sum payment. The total lump sum
payment made reduced plan assets by 226 million Swiss francs and settled 245 million Swiss francs of the defined benefit
obligation, resulting in a gain on settlement of 19 million Swiss francs.

Overall the funding status on an IFRS basis of the Group’s defined benefit plans increased to 88% compared to 81% at
the start of the year. This funding improvement was mainly due to a reduction in the defined benefit obligation arising from
a rise in discount rates at the end of 2013 in comparison to the end of 2012. The changes to the Group’s plans referred to
above also decreased the defined benefit obligation by 547 million Swiss francs. Plan assets remained stable as company
contributions increased to 352 million Swiss francs in 2013, compared to 307 million Swiss francs in 2012, with the settlement
in the US plans reducing plan assets by 226 million Swiss francs. The funded status of the pension funds is monitored by
the local pension fund governance bodies as well as being closely reviewed at a Group level. In addition to cash injections,
the Group initiated plan changes in several local pension plans, as described above.
Full details of the Group’s pensions and other post-employment benefits are given in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2013Proposed dividend
The Board of Directors is proposing an increase of 6% in the dividend for 2013 to 7.80 Swiss francs per share and non-voting
equity security (2012: 7.35 Swiss francs) for approval at the Annual General Meeting. This is the 27th consecutive increase
in the dividend. If the dividend proposal is approved by shareholders, dividend payments on the total shares and non-voting
equity securities will amount to 6.7 billion Swiss francs (2012: 6.3 billion Swiss francs), resulting in a pay-out ratio (based on
core net income) of 54.7% (2012: 54.5%). Based on the prices at year-end 2013, the dividend yield on the Roche share was
3.2% (2012: 3.9%) and the yield on the non-voting equity security was 3.1% (2012: 4.0%). Further information on the Roche
securities is given on pages 150–152 of the Finance Report.

Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewDebt
To finance the Genentech transaction in 2009, the Group issued bonds and notes equivalent to 48.2 billion Swiss francs. Of
the debt raised in early 2009, 67% had already been repaid by 31 December 2013. This includes the redemption of 3.3 billion
euro-denominated notes on the due date of 4 March 2013 and 1.75 billion US dollars of notes originally due 1 March 2014
that were redeemed on 21 March 2013 following an exercise of an early call option made in December 2012. In addition
400 million US dollars of notes originally due 1 March 2019 were redeemed on 29 August 2013 following an exercise by the
Group of an early call option made in June 2013. In the second half of the year the Group redeemed 400 million Swiss francs
of bonds on the due date of 23 September 2013 and, on 26 December 2013, the Group exercised its option to call for early
redemption of 1.0 billion US dollars of notes that were due 1 March 2019. These notes will be repaid on 3 March 2014.
The maturity schedule of the Group’s bonds and notes outstanding at 31 December 2013 is shown in the table below, which
includes those instruments that were already in issue prior to the Genentech transaction.

The Group plans to meet its debt obligations using existing liquid funds as well as cash generated from business operations.
In 2013 the free cash flow was 5.4 billion Swiss francs, which included the cash generated from operations, as well as
payment of interest, tax and dividends.
For short-term financing requirements, the Group has a commercial paper programme in the US under which it can issue
up to 7.5 billion US dollars of unsecured commercial paper notes and committed credit lines of 3.9 billion euros available
as back-stop lines. Commercial paper notes totalling 0.8 billion US dollars were outstanding at 31 December 2013 (2012:
0.4 billion US dollars). For longer-term financing the Group has maintained strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings
of AA by Standard & Poor’s and A1 by Moody’s which should facilitate efficient access to international capital markets.

Roche Group – Financial Review | Roche Finance Report 2013Financial risks
At 31 December 2013 the Group has a net debt position of 6.7 billion Swiss francs (2012: 10.6 billion Swiss francs).
The financial assets of the Group are managed in a conservative way with the objective to meet the Group’s financial
obligations at all times.
Asset allocation. A considerable portion of the cash and marketable securities the Group currently holds is being used
for debt redemptions. Liquid funds are either held as cash or are invested in high-quality, investment-grade fixed income
securities with an investment horizon to meet those liquidity requirements.

Total cash and marketable securities 11,935 100 13,991 100
Credit risk. Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations causing
financial losses for the Group. The rating profile of the Group’s 11.5 billion Swiss francs of cash and fixed income marketable
securities remained strong with 98% being invested in the A-AAA range. The Group has signed netting and collateral
agreements with the counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty risk on derivative positions.
The Group has trade receivables of 9.3 billion Swiss francs. Since 2010 there have been continuing financial difficulties
in Southern European countries, notably Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal. The Group is a leading supplier to the healthcare
sectors in these countries and at 31 December 2013 has trade receivables of 1.1 billion euros (1.3 billion Swiss francs)
with the public customers in these countries. There was a decrease of 13% compared to 31 December 2012 with improved
collections in Italy, Greece and Portugal, while Spain remained stable compared to 2012. The Group uses different measures
to improve collections in these countries, including intense communication with customers, factoring, negotiations
of payments plans, charging of interest for late payments, and legal action. The Group is applying new commercial
arrangements with some public hospitals in Greece and Portugal.
liquidity risk. Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point
in time. The Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity
requirements at any point in time. In addition to the current liquidity position, the Group has strong cash generation ability.
Those future cash flows will be used to repay debt instruments in the coming years.
Roche has strong long-term investment-grade credit ratings of AA by Standard & Poor’s and A1 by Moody’s. At the same
time Roche is rated at the highest available short-term ratings by those agencies. In the event of financing requirements,
the ratings and the strong credit of Roche should permit efficient access to international capital markets, including the
commercial paper market. The Group has committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling 5.1 billion Swiss
francs of which 4.8 billion Swiss francs serve as back-stop line for the commercial paper programme. At 31 December 2013
no debt has been drawn under these credit lines.
Market risk. Market risk arises from changing market prices of the Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities. The
exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Group uses Value-at-Risk
(VaR) to assess the impact of market risk on its financial instruments. VaR data indicates the value range within which a
given financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result of movements in market prices. The Group’s VaR
increased during 2013, mainly due to a gradual increase in long-term interest rates in major economies.
44
Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Financial ReviewInterest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could affect the Group financial result
or the value of the Group equity. As part of the Group’s hedging management during 2013 the Group entered into interest
rate swap contracts for a combined notional principal of 2.0 billion US dollars. These swapped the fixed interest rate of 6.0%
to an effective floating interest rate of 3 months USD-LIBOR plus an average spread of 4.74%. The maturity of the swaps is
1 March 2019. In the same period the Group has entered into interest rate swap contracts with a combined notional principal
of 100 million Swiss francs. These swapped the fixed interest rate of 1.0% to an effective floating interest rate of 3 months
CHF-LIBOR plus an average spread of 0.21%. The maturity of the swaps is 21 September 2018.
Further information on financial risk management and financial risks and the VaR methodology is included in Note 29 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
International Financial Reporting Standards
The Roche Group has been using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to report its consolidated results since
1990. Several new and revised standards have been implemented effective 1 January 2013. These are listed in Note 32 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. Except as noted below, these have no material impact on the Group’s overall results
and financial position.
Amongst other matters the revised version of IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ includes the following changes to the existing
standard:
E liminating the option to defer the recognition of actuarial gains and losses from defined benefit post-employment plans,
known as the ‘corridor method’. The Group has not previously applied this option, but rather uses the option to recognise
such gains and losses in other comprehensive income. The option previously applied by the Group will henceforth be
a requirement under the revised standard and therefore this change has no impact on the Group’s financial statements.
T he previous method of including the expected income from plan assets at an estimated asset return is replaced by
using the discount rate that is used to discount the defined benefit obligation. In the restated results of 2012 this causes
a reduction in net financial income of 164 million Swiss francs. There was no impact on Roche’s operating income or
net assets from this change.
P ast service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement in the period of a plan amendment. Previously, past
service costs had the portion related to unvested benefits deferred on the balance sheet, which was then progressively
released.
Further information on this topic was published in an Investor Update on 21 March 2013. This is available at
http://www.roche.com/investors/ir_update/inv-update-2013-03-21.htm.
The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of the various new and revised standards and interpretations that will
be effective from 1 January 2014 and beyond which the Group has not yet applied. Based on the analysis to date, the Group
does not anticipate that these will have a material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position.

Roche Group – Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Notes to the Roche Group
Consolidated Financial Statements
1. General accounting principles
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements (hereafter ‘the Annual Financial Statements’) of the Roche Group have been prepared
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. They have been prepared
using the historical cost convention except for items that are required to be accounted for at fair value. They were approved
for issue by the Board of Directors on 27 January 2014 and are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of
shareholders on 4 March 2014.
These financial statements are the Annual Financial Statements of Roche Holding Ltd, a company registered in Switzerland,
and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’).
The Group’s significant accounting policies and changes in accounting policies are disclosed in Note 32.
Key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the Annual Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and contingent amounts. Actual outcomes could
differ from those management estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and
are based on historical experience and various other factors. Revisions to estimates are recognised in the period in which
the estimate is revised. The following are considered to be the key accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions made
and are believed to be appropriate based upon currently available information.
Revenue. The nature of the Group’s business is such that many sales transactions do not have a simple structure and may
consist of multiple components occurring at different times. The Group is also party to out-licensing agreements which
involve upfront and milestone payments occurring over several years and which may also involve certain future obligations.
Revenue is only recognised when, in management’s judgement, the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been
transferred and when the Group does not retain continuing managerial involvement or effective control over the goods sold
or when the obligation has been fulfilled. For some transactions this can result in cash receipts being initially recognised
as deferred income and then released to income over subsequent periods on the basis of the performance of the conditions
specified in the agreement. There may be circumstances such that the level of sales returns, and hence revenues, cannot
be reliably measured. In such cases sales are only recognised when the right of return expires, which is generally upon
prescription of the products to patients. In order to estimate this, management uses publicly available information about
prescriptions as well as information provided by wholesalers and other intermediaries.
52
Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsAt 31 December 2013 the Group has 2,005 million Swiss francs in provisions and accruals for expected sales returns,
charge-backs and other rebates, including Medicaid in the US and similar rebates in other countries. Such estimates are
based on analyses of existing contractual or legislatively mandated obligations, historical trends and the Group’s experience.
At 31 December 2013 the Group has 425 million Swiss francs of provisions for doubtful receivables (see Note 11).
Such estimates are based on analyses of ageing of customer balances, specific credit circumstances, historical trends
and the Group’s experience, taking also into account current economic conditions.
Business combinations. The Group initially recognises the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed,
any non-controlling interest and the consideration transferred in a business combination. Management judgement
is particularly involved in the recognition and fair value measurement of intellectual property, contingent liabilities and
contingent consideration. In making this assessment management considers the underlying economic substance of
the items concerned in addition to the contractual terms.
Impairment. At 31 December 2013 the Group had 15,760 million Swiss francs in property, plant and equipment (see
Note 7), 7,145 million Swiss francs in goodwill (see Note 8) and 3,944 million Swiss francs in intangible assets (see Note 9).
Goodwill and intangible assets not yet available for use are reviewed annually for impairment. Property, plant and equipment
and intangible assets in use are assessed for impairment when there is a triggering event that provides evidence that an
asset may be impaired. To assess whether any impairment exists estimates of expected future cash flows are used. Actual
outcomes could vary significantly from such estimates of discounted future cash flows. Factors such as changes in discount
rates, the planned use of buildings, machinery or equipment or closure of facilities, the presence or absence of competition,
technical obsolescence and lower than anticipated product sales could lead to shorter useful lives or impairment.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits. The Group operates a number of defined benefit plans and the fair value
of the recognised plan assets and liabilities are based upon statistical and actuarial calculations. The measurement of the
net defined benefit obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in the discount rate, inflation rate, expected mortality and
medical cost trend rate assumptions. At 31 December 2013 the present value of the Group’s defined benefit obligation
is 16,684 million Swiss francs (see Note 25). The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to
changes in market and economic conditions, longer or shorter life spans of participants, and other changes in the factors
being assessed. These differences could impact on the assets or liabilities recognised in the balance sheet in future periods.
Legal provisions. The Group provides for anticipated legal settlement costs when there is a probable outflow of resources
that can be reliably estimated. At 31 December 2013 the Group had 634 million Swiss francs in legal provisions. The status
of significant legal cases is disclosed in Note 19. These estimates consider the specific circumstances of each legal case,
relevant legal advice and are inherently judgemental due to the highly complex nature of legal cases. The estimates could
change substantially over time as new facts emerge and each legal case progresses. Where no reliable estimate can be
made, no provision is recorded and contingent liabilities are disclosed where material.
Environmental provisions. The Group provides for anticipated environmental remediation costs when there is a probable
outflow of resources that can be reasonably estimated. At 31 December 2013 the Group had 624 million Swiss francs in
environmental provisions (see Note 19). Environmental provisions consist primarily of costs to fully clean and refurbish
contaminated sites, including landfills, and to treat and contain contamination at certain other sites. These estimates are
inherently judgemental due to uncertainties related to the detection of previously unknown contaminated sites, the method
and extent of remediation, the percentage of the problematic materials attributable to the Group at the remediation sites,
and the financial capabilities of the other potentially responsible parties. The estimates could change substantially over time
as new facts emerge and each environmental remediation progresses.
53
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Income taxes. At 31 December 2013 the Group had a current income tax net liability of 1,587 million Swiss francs and
a deferred tax net asset of 3,425 million Swiss francs (see Note 4). Significant estimates are required to determine the current
and deferred tax assets and liabilities. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations.
Factors that may impact on current and deferred taxes include changes in tax laws, regulations or rates, changing
interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, future levels of research and development spending and changes in
pre-tax earnings.
Leases. The treatment of leasing transactions is mainly determined by whether the lease is considered to be an operating
or finance lease. In making this assessment, management looks at the substance of the lease, as well as the legal form, and
makes a judgement about whether substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Arrangements
which do not take the legal form of a lease but that nevertheless convey the right to use an asset are also covered by such
assessments.
Consolidation. The Group periodically undertakes transactions that may involve obtaining control or significant influence
of other companies. These transactions include equity acquisitions, asset purchases, alliance agreements and other
transactions with structured entities. In all such cases management makes an assessment as to whether the Group has
control or significant influence of the other company, and whether it should be consolidated as a subsidiary or accounted
for as an associated company. In making this assessment management considers the underlying economic substance
of the transaction in addition to the contractual terms.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Supplementary unaudited information on sales by therapeutic areas in the Pharmaceuticals Division and by business areas in
the Diagnostics Division are given in the Financial Review. Sales are allocated to geographical areas by destination according
to the location of the customer. Royalties and other operating income are allocated according to the location of the Group
company that receives the revenue. European Union information is based on members of the EU at 31 December 2013.
Major customers
In total three US national wholesale distributors represent approximately a quarter of the Group’s revenues in 2013. The three
US national wholesale distributors are AmerisourceBergen Corp. with 5 billion Swiss francs (2012: 5 billion Swiss francs);
McKesson Corp. with 5 billion Swiss francs (2012: 5 billion Swiss francs) and Cardinal Health, Inc. with 3 billion Swiss francs
(2012: 2 billion Swiss francs). Approximately 96% of these revenues were in the Pharmaceuticals operating segment,
with the residual in the Diagnostics segment.

Since the Group operates internationally, it is subject to income taxes in many different tax jurisdictions. The Group calculates
its average expected tax rate as a weighted average of the tax rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
This rate changes from year to year due to changes in the mix of the Group’s taxable income and changes in local tax rates.
The Group’s average expected tax rate increased by 2.4 percentage points to 22.6% in 2013 (2012: 20.2%). The main driver
for the increase was due to the growth in the proportion of the Group’s profits generated in the US, which has a relatively
higher local tax rate than the average Group rate. There were no significant local tax rate changes in the main operating
areas of the Group compared to 2012.
The Group’s effective tax rate increased to 22.5% in 2013 (2012: 20.6%). The main driver for the increase was the increase
in the average expected tax rate explained above. This was partially offset by the retrospective re-enactment of the 2012
US research and development tax credits in January 2013, which means that the 2013 results include a whole year of tax
credits in respect of 2012 as well as tax credits for 2013.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax losses carried forward only to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefit
is probable. The Group has unrecognised tax losses, including valuation allowances, as follows:
Unrecognised tax losses: expiry

Total unrecognised tax losses 4,484 6% 3,446 7%
The ‘More than five years’ category includes losses that cannot be used for US state income tax purposes in those states
which only permit tax reporting on a separate entity basis.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been established for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the
unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, where such amounts are currently regarded as permanently reinvested. The total
unremitted earnings of the Group, regarded as permanently reinvested, were 29.7 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2013
(2012: 30.9 billion Swiss francs).
5. Business combinations
Acquisitions – 2013
Constitution Medical Investors, Inc. On 1 July 2013 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Constitution
Medical Investors, Inc. (‘CMI’), a US private company based in Massachusetts. CMI is the developer of a highly innovative
hematology testing system, which is designed to provide faster and more accurate diagnosis of blood-related diseases,
helping to improve patient care. CMI is reported in the Diagnostics operating segment as part of the Professional Diagnostics
business area. The total consideration was 286 million US dollars, of which 220 million US dollars was paid in cash and
66 million US dollars arose from a contingent consideration arrangement. The contingent payments are based on the
achievement of performance-related milestones that may arise until the end of 2017 and the range of undiscounted outcomes
is between zero and 255 million US dollars. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table
below.

Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsThe fair value of the intangible asset is determined using an excess earning method that is based on management forecasts
and observable market data for discount rates, tax rates and foreign exchange rates. The present value is calculated using
a risk-adjusted discount rate of 12.5%. The valuation was performed by an independent valuer.
Goodwill represents a control premium and synergies that can be obtained from the Group’s existing business. None of
the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Directly attributable transaction costs of 3 million Swiss
francs are reported in the Diagnostics operating segment within general and administration expenses. The impact of the
CMI acquisition on the Diagnostics Division and Group reported results was not material.
Acquisitions – 2012
Verum. On 3 January 2012 the Group acquired a 100% controlling interest in Verum Diagnostica GmbH (‘Verum’), a German
private company based in Munich. Verum is reported in the Diagnostics operating segment. The total consideration was
11 million euros of which 10 million euros were paid in cash and 1 million euros arose from a contingent consideration
arrangement. The contingent payments are based on the achievement of performance-related milestones and the range
of undiscounted outcomes is between zero and 2 million euros. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed
are set out in the table below.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 20136. Global restructuring plans
During 2013 the Group continued with the implementation of several major global restructuring plans initiated in prior years,
notably the reorganisation of research and development in the Pharmaceuticals Division and programmes to address the
long-term profitability in the Diabetes Care and former Applied Science businesses in Diagnostics. Additionally, there was
income of 531 million Swiss francs from the reversal of previously incurred impairment charges for a bulk drug production
unit at the Vacaville site in California.

Diagnostics Division – Diabetes Care and Applied Science restructuring
On 23 April 2013 the Group announced that the Applied Science business area’s portfolio of products will be integrated
within the other business areas of the Diagnostics Division. This will streamline decision-making and enhance technology
flow from research use to the clinical setting. On 26 September 2013 Roche Diabetes Care announced its ‘Autonomy and
Speed’ initiative which will enable the business to focus on Diabetes Care specific requirements, speed up processes
and decision-making and drive efficiencies. Various initiatives were announced in 2012 for the Diabetes Care and Applied
Science businesses, which included increasing the efficiency of marketing and distribution operations and research
and development activities.
64
Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsDuring 2013 total costs of 220 million Swiss francs (2012: 180 million Swiss francs) were incurred mainly for headcount
reductions, IT-related costs and site closure costs. In addition, goodwill impairment charges of 35 million Swiss francs were
incurred for the write-off of the goodwill from the Innovatis and 454 Life Sciences acquisitions in the former Applied Science
business area. Intangible asset impairment charges of 12 million Swiss francs were also incurred related to the restructuring.
During 2012 a goodwill impairment charge of 187 million Swiss francs was incurred for the full write-off of the goodwill from
the NimbleGen acquisition and intangible asset impairment charges of 29 million Swiss francs were incurred.
Pharmaceuticals Division – Research and Development reorganisation
On 26 June 2012 the Group announced a streamlining of the research and development activities within the Pharmaceuticals
Division. The planned operational closure of the US site in Nutley, New Jersey, was completed on schedule by the end
of 2013.
During 2013 total costs of 239 million Swiss francs were incurred. These costs include 116 million Swiss francs for employee-
related, site closure and other costs during the year and additional provisions of 88 million Swiss francs to cover site running
costs until the expected divestment in 2015. The provisions were mainly for employee-related costs, property taxes and
outside services. There was a further impairment of 35 million Swiss francs to the carrying value of the Nutley site, based on
the most recent external property market data. The first results of the environmental investigations showed that the expected
cost of remediation may be lower than originally expected and accordingly the environmental provisions were reduced by
53 million Swiss francs.
During 2012 total costs of 596 million Swiss francs were incurred mainly for severance, other employee-related costs
and property, plant and equipment impairments at the Nutley site. In addition there were environmental remediation costs
at the Nutley site of 243 million Swiss francs and intangible asset impairment charges of 46 million Swiss francs as a result
of portfolio prioritisation decisions linked to the reorganisation.
Other global restructuring plans
On 14 October 2013 the Pharmaceuticals Division announced that, as part of its investments to increase its global biologic
medicine manufacturing network capacity, a bulk drug production unit at the Vacaville site in California that had been
discontinued and fully written down in 2009 will be put back into service. This resulted in an income of 531 million Swiss
francs from the reversal of previously incurred impairment charges (see Note 7).
During 2013 costs of 126 million Swiss francs (2012: 484 million Swiss francs) were incurred for the previously announced
Operational Excellence programme, mainly for employee-related and site closure costs in the Pharmaceuticals Division and
employee-related and site closure costs in the Diagnostics Division for the sites in Burgdorf, Switzerland and Graz, Austria.
Other plans totalled 112 million Swiss francs (2012: 49 million Swiss francs). In 2012 there were also 128 million Swiss francs
of restructuring costs and intangible asset impairment charges of 112 million Swiss francs in respect of the termination of
the dalcetrapib dal-OUTCOMES trial and all the studies in the dal-HEART programme.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Impairment reversal (charge)
On 14 October 2013 the Pharmaceuticals Division announced details of investments to increase its global biologic
medicine manufacturing network capacity to meet the rising demand for licensed biologics and expected pipeline growth.
The investments will be spread across sites in Penzberg (Germany), Basel (Switzerland) as well as Vacaville and Oceanside
(US). In 2009 a bulk drug production unit at the Vacaville site in California, which was not yet licensed, was discontinued
and fully written down as part of a reassessment of the global manufacturing network requirements at that time. The bulk
drug production unit at the Vacaville site will require capital investment before it can become operational, which is expected
to occur in 2015. The Group’s decision to restart licensing efforts and prepare for operational use of the discontinued bulk
drug production unit at the Vacaville site for commercial manufacturing has resulted in an impairment reversal of property,
plant and equipment of 531 million Swiss francs in 2013. The impairment reversal of 531 million Swiss francs represents the
net book value from the time of the original impairment for the assets that will be brought back into use, less the depreciation
that would have been charged in the intervening period had that impairment not occurred (see Note 6). This was partly offset
by a further impairment of 35 million Swiss francs to the carrying value of the Nutley site, based on the most recent external
property market data. During 2012 the impairment charges mainly related to property, plant and equipment at the Nutley site.

Finance leases. At 31 December 2013 the capitalised cost of property, plant and equipment under finance leases was
294 million Swiss francs (2012: 327 million Swiss francs) and the net book value of these assets was 124 million Swiss francs
(2012: 159 million Swiss francs). The carrying value of the leasing obligation was 178 million Swiss francs (2012: 203 million
Swiss francs), which is reported as part of Debt (see Note 20).

Impairment charge
During 2013 impairment charges totalling 288 million Swiss francs were recorded which related to:
A goodwill impairment charge of 253 million Swiss francs was recorded in the Tissue Diagnostics business area within
the Diagnostics Division. This impairment is based on the latest business plans prepared during the second half of 2013.
The main factors leading to this impairment were reduced revenue expectations in the US following recent changes in
the College of American Pathologists guidelines for the use of negative reagent controls in immunohistochemistry testing
which reduced volumes and changes which reduced the reimbursement amount to laboratories.
On 23 April 2013 the Group announced a reorganisation of the Applied Science business area (see Note 6). A goodwill
impairment charge of 35 million Swiss francs was incurred for the full write-off of the goodwill from the 454 Life Sciences
acquisition in 2007 and the Innovatis acquisition in 2009 in the former Applied Science business area.
During 2012 a goodwill impairment charge of 187 million Swiss francs was incurred for the full write-off of the goodwill from
the NimbleGen acquisition in 2007 (see Note 6).

Pharmaceuticals Division. The division’s sub-divisions are the cash-generating units used for the testing of goodwill.
For Chugai, the recoverable amount is based on fair value less costs to sell, determined with reference to the publicly quoted
share prices of Chugai shares. For Roche Pharmaceuticals, the recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is based
on value in use. The cash flow projections used for Roche Pharmaceuticals impairment testing are based on the most recent
business plans approved by management. The business plans include management’s latest estimates on sales volume and
pricing, and production and other operating costs and assumes no significant changes in the organisation.
The business plans are projected over five years. These valuations include a terminal value beyond these years, assuming
no further growth. The discount rate used is based on an after-tax rate of 7.3% (2012: 6.4%), which is derived from a capital
asset pricing model using data from capital markets, including government twenty-year bonds. A weighted average tax rate
of 25.5% (2012: 25.5%) is used in the calculations and the corresponding pre-tax discount rate is 9.8% (2012: 8.6%).
Diagnostics Division. The division’s business areas are the cash-generating units used for the testing of goodwill. The
goodwill arising from the Corange/Boehringer Mannheim acquisition and part of the goodwill from the Ventana acquisition
is recorded and monitored at a divisional level as it relates to the strategic development of the whole division and cannot
be meaningfully allocated to the division’s business areas. Therefore the cash-generating unit for this goodwill is the entire
division.
The recoverable amount used in the impairment testing is based on value in use and the cash flow projections are based
on the most recent business plans approved by management. The business plans include management’s latest estimates on
sales volume and pricing, and production and other operating costs and assumes no significant changes in the organisation.
The business plans are projected over five years, except for the Tissue Diagnostics business area which is projected over
ten years reflecting the long-term nature of this business. These valuations include a terminal value beyond these years,
assuming no further growth. The discount rate used is based on an after-tax rate of 7.3% (2012: 6.4%), which is derived from
a capital asset pricing model using data from capital markets, including government twenty-year bonds. A weighted average
tax rate of 17.6% (2012: 15.9%) is used in the calculations and the corresponding pre-tax discount rate is 8.8% (2012: 7.7%).
Sensitivity analysis
Management has performed sensitivity analyses for both Roche Pharmaceuticals and the Diagnostics Division, which
increased the discount rate by 1% combined with decreasing the forecast cash flows by 5%, and for Chugai, which
decreased the publicly quoted share prices by 5%. Except for the Tissue Diagnostics business area, the results of the
sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the above changes in the key assumptions would not cause the carrying value of
goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount at 31 December 2013. The above key assumption changes would result in
a further goodwill impairment of 365 million Swiss francs in the Tissue Diagnostics business area at 31 December 2013.

Internally generated intangible assets
The Group currently has no internally generated intangible assets from development as the criteria for the recognition
as an asset are not met.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
The Group currently has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Intangible assets not available for use
These mostly represent in-process research and development assets acquired either through in-licensing arrangements,
business combinations or separate purchases. At 31 December 2013 approximately 49% of the projects in the Pharmaceuticals
Division have known decision points within the next twelve months which in certain circumstances could lead to impairment.
Due to the inherent uncertainties in the research and development processes, intangible assets not available for use are
particularly at risk of impairment if the project is not expected to result in a commercialised product.
Intangible asset impairment
Impairment charges arise from changes in the estimates of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset
and its eventual disposal. Factors such as the presence or absence of competition, technical obsolescence or lower than
anticipated sales for products with capitalised rights could result in shortened useful lives or impairment.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Impairment charges – 2013
Pharmaceuticals Division. Impairment charges totalling 350 million Swiss francs were recorded which related to:
A portfolio reassessment within the hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise (286 million Swiss francs). The assets concerned,
which were not yet being amortised, were written down to their recoverable value of 167 million Swiss francs.
A portfolio reassessment within the cardiovascular and metabolic diseases franchise (31 million Swiss francs). The asset
concerned, which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
A decision to stop two collaboration projects with alliance partners (26 million Swiss francs). The assets concerned, which
were being amortised, were fully written down.
A decision to stop development of one compound with an alliance partner (7 million Swiss francs). The asset concerned,
which was not yet being amortised, was fully written down.
Diagnostics Division. Impairment charges totalling 12 million Swiss francs were recorded from the Applied Science
business area reorganisation (see Note 6). The assets concerned, which were not yet being amortised, were fully written
down.
Impairment charges – 2012
Pharmaceuticals Division. Impairment charges totalling 489 million Swiss francs were recorded which related to:
A clinical data assessment of a project acquired as part of the Marcadia acquisition (162 million Swiss francs).
Various global restructuring initiatives (158 million Swiss francs), mainly related to the termination of the dalcetrapib trials
(see Note 6).
Portfolio prioritisation decisions (103 million Swiss francs), mainly related to the return of the monoclonal antibody RG 7334
anti-PLGF MAb to the alliance partners.
A clinical data assessment of two collaboration projects with alliance partners (53 million Swiss francs).
A decision to stop development of one compound with an alliance partner (13 million Swiss francs).
Diagnostics Division. Impairment charges totalling 36 million Swiss francs were recorded which mainly related to
the Applied Science business area restructuring (see Note 6).
Potential commitments from alliance collaborations
The Group is party to in-licensing and similar arrangements with its alliance partners. These arrangements may require
the Group to make certain milestone or other similar payments dependent upon the achievement of agreed objectives or
performance targets as defined in the collaboration agreements.
The Group’s current estimate of future third-party commitments for such payments is set out in the table below. These
figures are undiscounted and are not risk adjusted, meaning that they include all such potential payments that can arise
assuming all projects currently in development are successful. The timing is based on the Group’s current best estimate.
These figures do not include any potential commitments within the Group, such as may arise between the Roche and Chugai
businesses.

Legal provisions
Legal provisions consist of a number of separate legal matters, including claims arising from trade, in various Group
companies. By their nature the amounts and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict.
In 2013 legal expenses totalled 97 million Swiss francs (2012: 72 million Swiss francs) which reflect the recent developments
in various legal matters. Details of the major legal cases outstanding are disclosed below.
79
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Environmental provisions
Provisions for environmental matters include various separate environmental issues in a number of countries. By their nature
the amounts and timings of any outflows are difficult to predict. Significant provisions are discounted by between 4% and 5%
where the time value of money is material. The significant provisions relate to the closure of the US site in Nutley, New Jersey
and the estimated remediation costs for a landfill site near Grenzach, Germany, that was used by manufacturing operations
that were closed some years ago. During 2013 there was an increase of 138 million Swiss francs to the estimated remediation
costs for the landfill site near Grenzach, which is based on the latest remediation plan which is due to be submitted to the
local authorities for approval in 2014. The first results of the environmental investigations at Nutley showed that the expected
cost of remediation may be lower than originally expected and accordingly the environmental provisions were reduced by
53 million Swiss francs.
Restructuring provisions
These arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of business undertaken by the Group or the manner
in which business is conducted. Such provisions include only the costs necessarily entailed by the restructuring which are
not associated with the recurring activities of the Group. The timings of these cash outflows are reasonably certain. These
provisions are not discounted as the time value of money is not material in these matters. The significant provisions relate to
the restructuring of research and development activities within the Pharmaceuticals Division, mainly related to the closure
of the US site in Nutley, New Jersey and the restructuring of the Diabetes Care and Applied Science businesses within the
Diagnostics Division.
Employee provisions
These mostly relate to certain employee benefit obligations, such as sabbatical leave and long-service benefits. The timings
of these cash outflows can be reasonably estimated based on past performance.
Other provisions
The timings of cash outflows are by their nature uncertain and the best estimates are shown in the table below.

Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees, to be affected by political,
legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating to environmental protection, in the countries in
which it operates. The industries in which the Group operates are also subject to other risks of various kinds. The nature
and frequency of these developments and events, not all of which are covered by insurance, as well as their effect on future
operations and earnings, are not predictable.
The Group has entered into strategic alliances with various companies in order to gain access to potential new products or
to utilise other companies to help develop the Group’s own potential new products. Potential future payments may become
due to certain collaboration partners achieving certain milestones as defined in the collaboration agreements. The Group’s
best estimates of future commitments for such payments are given in Note 9.

Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsPharmaceuticals legal cases
Accutane. Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (‘HLR’) and various other Roche affiliates have been named as defendants in numerous
legal actions in the United States and elsewhere relating to the acne medication Accutane. The litigation alleges that
Accutane caused certain serious conditions, including, but not limited to, inflammatory bowel disease (‘IBD’), birth defects
and psychiatric disorders. At 31 December 2013 HLR was defending approximately 7,760 actions involving approximately
7,863 plaintiffs brought in various federal and state courts throughout the US for personal injuries allegedly resulting from
their use of Accutane. Most of the actions allege IBD as a result of Accutane use. In 2009 HLR announced that, following
a re-evaluation of its portfolio of medicines that are now available from generic manufacturers, rapidly declining brand sales
in the US and high costs from personal-injury lawsuits that it continues to defend vigorously, it had decided to immediately
discontinue the manufacture and distribution of the product in the US.
All of the actions pending in federal court alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District
Litigation in the US District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division. Since July 2007 the District Court has
granted summary judgment in favour of HLR for all of the federal IBD cases that have proceeded. Since August 2008 all
of these rulings have been affirmed by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit when plaintiffs appealed. Multiple
recently filed matters remain pending.
All of the actions pending in state court in New Jersey alleging IBD were consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the
Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Atlantic County. At 31 December 2013 juries in the Superior Court have ruled
in favour of the plaintiff in eight cases, assessing total compensatory damages totalling 67.7 million US dollars, and ruled
in favour of HLR in four cases. For the eight cases that were originally ruled in favour of the plaintiff by the Superior Court,
HLR is in the process of appealing two cases (27.4 million US dollars); one case is scheduled for a retrial in January 2014
(10.5 million US dollars); post-trial briefing is ongoing for two cases (18.0 million US dollars); and three cases have had their
verdicts reversed in favour of HLR (11.8 million US dollars).
Additional trials may be scheduled for 2014. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including many that are
unique to the particular case and therefore the trial results to date may not be predictive of future trial results. The Group
continues to defend vigorously the remaining personal injury cases and claims.
Rituxan arbitration. In October 2008 Genentech and Biogen Idec Inc. filed a complaint in California against Sanofi-Aventis
Deutschland GmbH (‘Sanofi’), Sanofi-Aventis US LLC and Sanofi-Aventis US Inc. seeking a declaratory judgment that certain
Genentech products, including Rituxan, do not infringe Sanofi’s US Patent Nos. 5,849,522 and 6,218,140 and that the ‘522
and ‘140 patents are invalid. Sanofi alleged that Rituxan and another Genentech product infringe certain claims of the ‘522
and ‘140 patents. In March 2011 the district court ruled as a matter of law that Genentech and Biogen Idec do not infringe
the asserted patent claims. In May 2011 Sanofi appealed the court’s non-infringement ruling. The appellate court affirmed
the district court’s judgment of no patent infringement.
In addition in October 2008 Sanofi affiliate Hoechst GmbH filed with the ICC International Court of Arbitration (Paris)
a request for arbitration with Genentech, relating to a terminated patent-license agreement between one of Hoechst’s
predecessors and Genentech that pertained to the above-mentioned patents and related patents outside the US. Hoechst
sought payment of patent-license royalties on sales of certain Genentech products, including Rituxan, damages for breach
of contract, and other relief. In various arbitral awards in September 2012 and February 2013, the arbitrator found Genentech
liable to Hoechst for patent-license royalties on Rituxan, and he awarded the royalties and interest that Hoechst had sought.
In February 2013 the Group recorded a back royalty expense of 42 million Swiss francs, net of the assumed reimbursement
of a portion of the Group’s obligation by its co-promotion partner in the US, and a corresponding amount in accrued liabilities
(31 December 2012: accrued liability of 61 million Swiss francs).
Hoechst initiated proceedings in the US, France and Germany seeking to enforce the arbitral awards. In October 2013
Genentech paid the awarded royalties and interest to Hoechst under protest. Genentech is seeking annulment of the arbitral
awards through proceedings it initiated in the Court of Appeal of Paris. A hearing in those proceedings is scheduled for
June 2014. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Average Wholesale Prices litigation. HLR and Roche Laboratories Inc. (‘RLI’), along with approximately 50 other brand
and generic pharmaceutical companies, have been named as defendants in several legal actions in the US relating to
the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs and State Medicaid reimbursement. The primary allegation in these litigations is that
the pharmaceutical companies misrepresented or otherwise reported inaccurate Average Wholesale Prices (‘AWP’) and/
or Wholesale Acquisition Costs (‘WAC’) for their drugs, which prices were allegedly relied upon by the States in calculating
Medicaid reimbursements to entities such as retail pharmacies. The States, through their respective Attorney General,
are seeking repayment of the amounts they claim were over-reimbursed. The time period associated with these cases is 1991
through 2005. At 31 December 2013 HLR and RLI are defending one AWP action filed in the state of New Jersey. Discovery
is currently pending in this case. HLR and RLI are vigorously defending themselves in this matter. The outcome of this matter
cannot be determined at this time.
PDL litigation. In August 2010 PDL Biopharma (‘PDL’) filed a complaint in Nevada against Genentech seeking a judicial
declaration concerning Genentech’s obligation to pay royalties on certain ex-US sales of Herceptin, Avastin, Xolair and
Lucentis under a 2003 agreement between the parties. In September 2010 PDL filed a first amended complaint asserting
additional claims against Genentech, including breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair
dealing. PDL also asserted new claims against Roche and Novartis for intentional interference with contractual relations.
In addition to declaratory relief, PDL is seeking monetary damages including compensatory and liquidated damages. In
November 2010 Genentech and Roche filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and Roche filed an additional
motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. In July 2011 the court denied the motions. PDL settled its claim against
Novartis.
In addition to the litigation, PDL conducted a royalty audit related to sales of Avastin, Herceptin, Lucentis, Xolair and Raptiva
for the years 2007 through 2009. The final audit report indicated that, under PDL’s interpretation of certain contract terms,
Genentech owes PDL additional royalties for the audit period. Under the same interpretation, Genentech may owe additional
royalties for years subsequent to the audit period. The Group disputes PDL’s interpretation of the relevant contract terms
and does not believe that additional royalties are owed. In June 2013 PDL filed a demand for arbitration related to its audit
claims with the American Arbitration Association.
The parties have stayed the arbitration proceeding and Nevada litigation, and are engaged in discussions to determine
if a settlement of certain issues is possible.
GSK litigation. In September 2010 GlaxoSmithKline LLC (‘GSK’) and Genentech each filed patent lawsuits against one
another in Delaware and California, respectively. The lawsuits concern GSK’s US Patent Nos. RE40,070 and RE41,555.
GSK is asserting claims against Genentech alleging infringement of the patents by Herceptin and Lucentis, and is seeking
compensatory damages. In its lawsuit Genentech is seeking a judicial declaration of non-infringement and invalidity of
the patents. In June 2012 the parties agreed to dismiss the California action without prejudice and the consolidated case
is now proceeding in Delaware. On 22 August 2013 the Delaware Court issued a claim construction order construing two
terms of the ‘555 patent. Trial is scheduled for June 2014. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Boniva litigation. HLR, Genentech and various other Roche affiliates (collectively ‘Roche’) have been named as
defendants in numerous legal actions in the US and Canada relating to the post-menopausal osteoporosis medication Boniva.
In these litigations, the plaintiffs allege that Boniva caused either osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypical femoral fractures.
At 31 December 2013 Roche is defending approximately 306 actions involving approximately 320 plaintiffs brought in federal
and state courts throughout the US and one action brought in the Court of the Queen’s Bench, Province of Saskatchewan,
Canada, for personal injuries allegedly resulting from the use of Boniva. All of these cases are in the early discovery stages
of litigation. Individual trial results depend on a variety of factors, including many that are unique to the particular case. Roche
is vigorously defending itself in these matters. The outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
82
Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsEMA investigation. On 23 October 2012 the European Medicines Agency (‘EMA’) announced that it would start an
infringement procedure to investigate allegations regarding an alleged breach of medicines safety reporting obligations in
relation to 19 centrally authorised medicines. On 19 November 2013 the EMA announced the results of the Pharmacovigilance
Risk Assessment Committee assessment of Roche’s medicines. The EMA found no impact regarding the benefit-risk balance
of any of Roche’s medicines and confirmed the benefit-risk profiles based on available safety information. The EMA and
other health authorities have confirmed all medicines remain authorised without changes to the treatment advice for patients
and healthcare professionals. All corrective and preventative actions resulting from the inspections are being implemented.
A re-inspection by authorities in November 2013 led to certain findings which Roche is now addressing. The EMA
infringement procedure is ongoing and the EMA is expected to issue its report to the EU Commission by April 2014 at
the latest. The outcome of this investigation cannot be determined at this time.
Diagnostics legal cases
Marsh Supermarkets litigation. In July 2008 Marsh Supermarkets Inc. (‘Marsh’) filed a breach of contract suit against
Roche Diagnostics Operations, Inc. (‘RDO’). The lawsuit relates to the termination of a sub-lease agreement for a building
by RDO. In December 2011 a Hamilton Superior Court judge awarded Marsh 19.5 million US dollars, which was provided for
in 2011. On 1 April 2013 the Court of Appeals of Indiana upheld the judgment. On 31 October 2013, after the Indiana Supreme
Court had declined to hear the further appeal by Roche, RDO paid the final awarded damages and interest of 22.5 million
US dollars to Marsh. This matter is now concluded.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Early redemption of US dollar-denominated notes in 2014. On 26 December 2013 the Group resolved to exercise
its option to call for early partial redemption of US dollar-denominated 6.0% fixed rate notes due 1 March 2019. The Group
will redeem an outstanding principal of 1.0 billion US dollars on 3 March 2014 at an amount equal to the sum of the present
values of the remaining scheduled payments of these notes discounted to the redemption date at the US Treasury rate
plus 0.50%, together with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal. The US Treasury rate will be determined by an
independent investment banker on the third business day preceding the redemption. A cash outflow of approximately
1,173 million US dollars, plus accrued interest, is expected on redemption. The Group has revised the carrying value of these
notes to take into account the changes to the amounts and timings of the estimated cash flows. The revised carrying value
of these notes at 31 December 2013 is 1,171 million US dollars (1,040 million Swiss francs). The increase in carrying value
of 182 million US dollars (167 million Swiss francs) is recorded within financing costs (see Note 3) as a loss on redemption.
The effective interest rate of these notes is 6.37%.
Redemption and repurchase of bonds and notes – 2012

Genentech transaction
The Group completed the purchase of the non-controlling interests in Genentech effective 26 March 2009. Based on
the International Accounting Standard 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ (IAS 27) and consistent with the International
Financial Reporting Standard 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ (IFRS 10), which was adopted by the Group in 2013, this
transaction was accounted for in full as an equity transaction. As a consequence, the carrying amount of the consolidated
equity of the Group at that time was reduced by 52.2 billion Swiss francs, of which 8.5 billion Swiss francs was allocated
to eliminate the book value of Genentech non-controlling interests. This accounting effect significantly impacted the Group’s
net equity, but has no effect on the Group’s business or its dividend policy.

Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsShare capital
At 31 December 2013 the authorised and issued share capital of Roche Holding Ltd, which is the Group’s parent company,
consisted of 160 million shares with a nominal value of 1.00 Swiss franc each, as in the preceding year. The shares are bearer
shares and the Group does not maintain a register of shareholders. Based on information supplied to the Group, a shareholder
group with pooled voting rights owns 45.01% (2012: 45.01%) of the issued shares. On 24 March 2011 the shareholder group
announced that it would continue the shareholder pooling agreement existing since 1948 with a modified shareholder
composition. The shareholder group with pooled voting rights now holds 72,018,000 shares, corresponding to 45.01% of the
shares issued. This figure does not include any shares without pooled voting rights that are held outside this group by individual
members of the group. Ms Maja Oeri, formerly a member of the pool, now holds 8,091,900 shares representing 5.057% of
the voting rights independently of the pool. This is further described in Note 30. Based on information supplied to the Group,
Novartis Ltd, Basel, and its affiliates own 33.3330% (participation below 331⁄ 3%) of the issued shares (2012: 33.3330%).
Non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
At 31 December 2013, 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities have been authorised and were in issue as in the preceding
year. Under Swiss company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value, are not part of the share capital
and cannot be issued against a contribution which would be shown as an asset in the balance sheet of Roche Holding Ltd.
Each non-voting equity security confers the same rights as any of the shares to participate in the net profit and any remaining
proceeds from liquidation following repayment of the nominal value of the shares and, if any, participation certificates.
In accordance with the law and the Articles of Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd, the Company is entitled at all times
to exchange all or some of the non-voting equity securities into shares or participation certificates.
Dividends
On 5 March 2013 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of 7.35 Swiss francs per share and non-voting
equity security (2012: 6.80 Swiss francs) in respect of the 2012 business year. The distribution to holders of outstanding
shares and non-voting equity securities totalled 6,238 million Swiss francs (2012: 5,770 million Swiss francs) and has
been recorded against retained earnings in 2013. The Board of Directors has proposed dividends for the 2013 business
year of 7.80 Swiss francs per share and non-voting equity security which, if approved, would result in a total distribution
to shareholders of 6,728 million Swiss francs. This is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting on 4 March 2014.

22. Chugai
Effective 1 October 2002 the Roche Group and Chugai completed an alliance to create a leading research-driven Japanese
pharmaceutical company, which was formed by the merger of Chugai and Roche’s Japanese pharmaceuticals subsidiary,
Nippon Roche. The merged company is known as Chugai.
Consolidated subsidiary
Chugai is a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Group. This is based on the Group’s interest in Chugai at 31 December 2013
of 61.5% (2012: 61.6%) and the Roche relationship with Chugai that is founded on the Basic Alliance, Licensing and Research
Collaboration Agreements.

Chugai prepares financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) which are
filed on a quarterly basis with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to certain consolidation entries there are minor differences
between Chugai’s stand-alone IFRS results and the results of Chugai as consolidated by the Roche Group in accordance
with IFRS.

Roche’s relationship with Chugai
Chugai has entered into certain agreements with Roche, which are discussed below:
Basic Alliance Agreement. As part of the Basic Alliance Agreement signed in December 2001, Roche and Chugai entered
into certain arrangements covering the future operation and governance of Chugai. Amongst other matters these cover
the following areas:
The structuring of the alliance.
Roche’s rights as a shareholder.
Roche’s rights to nominate members of Chugai’s Board of Directors.
Certain limitations to Roche’s ability to buy or sell Chugai’s common stock.
Chugai issues additional shares of common stock in connection with its convertible debt and equity compensation plans,
and may issue additional shares for other purposes, which affects Roche’s percentage ownership interest. The Basic
Alliance Agreement provides, amongst other matters, that Chugai will guarantee Roche’s right to maintain its shareholding
percentage in Chugai at not less than 50.1%.
Licensing Agreements. Under the Japan Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in December 2001, Chugai has exclusive rights
to market Roche’s pharmaceutical products in Japan. Chugai also has right of first refusal on the development and marketing
in Japan of all development compounds advanced by Roche.
91
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Under the Rest of the World Umbrella Rights Agreement signed in May 2002, Roche has the right of first refusal on
the development and marketing of Chugai’s development compounds in markets outside Japan, excluding South Korea,
if Chugai decides that it requires a partner for such activities.
Further to these agreements, Roche and Chugai have signed a series of separate agreements for certain specific products.
Depending on the specific circumstances and the terms of the agreement, this may result in payments on an arm’s length
basis between Roche and Chugai, for any or all of the following matters:
Upfront payments, if a right of first refusal to license a product is exercised.
Milestone payments, dependent upon the achievement of agreed performance targets.
Royalties on future product sales.
These specific product agreements may also cover the manufacture and supply of the respective products to meet the other
party’s clinical and/or commercial requirements on an arm’s length basis.
Research Collaboration Agreements. Roche and Chugai have entered into research collaboration agreements in the areas
of small-molecule synthetic drug research and biotechnology-based drug discovery.

25. Pensions and other post-employment benefits
As disclosed in Note 32, following the implementation of IAS 19 (revised), the Group has amended its accounting policy
with respect to pensions and other post-employment benefits and restated the related 2012 comparatives and disclosures.
The Group’s objective is to provide attractive and competitive post-employment benefits to employees, while at the same
time ensuring that the various plans are appropriately financed and managing any potential impacts on the Group’s long-
term financial position. Most employees are covered by pension plans sponsored by Group companies. The nature of such
plans varies according to legal regulations, fiscal requirements and market practice in the countries in which the employees
are employed. Post-employment benefit plans are classified for IFRS as ‘defined contribution plans’ if the Group pays fixed
contributions into a separate fund or to a third-party financial institution and will have no further legal or constructive
obligation to pay further contributions. All other plans are classified as ‘defined benefit plans’.
Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans are funded through payments by employees and by the Group to funds administered by third
parties. The Group’s expenses for these plans were 343 million Swiss francs (2012: 313 million Swiss francs). No assets or
liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet in respect of such plans, apart from regular prepayments and accruals
of the contributions withheld from employees’ wages and salaries and of the Group’s contributions. The Group’s major
defined contribution plans are in the United States, notably the US Roche 401(k) Savings Plan.
93
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Defined benefit plans
Plans are usually established as trusts independent of the Group and are funded by payments from Group companies
and by employees. In some cases, notably for the major defined benefit plans in Germany, the plans are unfunded and the
Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its own financial resources. Plans are usually governed by a senior
governing body, such as a Board of Trustees, which is typically composed of both employee and employer representatives.
Funding of these plans is determined by local regulations using independent actuarial valuations. Separate independent
actuarial valuations, together with a semi-annual update, are prepared in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 for use
in the Group’s financial statements. The Group’s major defined benefit plans are located in Switzerland, the US and Germany,
which in total account for 81% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation (2012: 81%).
Pension plans in Switzerland. Current pension arrangements for employees in Switzerland are made through plans
governed by the Swiss Federal Occupational Old Age, Survivors and Disability Pension Act (‘BVG’). The Group’s pension
plans are administered by separate legal foundations, which are funded by regular employee and company contributions.
The final benefit is contribution-based with certain minimum guarantees. Due to these minimum guarantees, the Swiss plans
are treated as defined benefit plans for the purposes of these IFRS financial statements, although they have many of the
characteristics of defined contribution plans. Where there is an under-funding this may be remedied by various measures
such as increasing employee and company contributions, lowering the interest rate on retirement account balances,
reducing prospective benefits and a suspension of the early withdrawal facility.
Past service costs in 2013 include 142 million Swiss francs of income recorded in respect of changes to the Group’s pension
plans in Switzerland. The change represents the adoption of lower conversion rates, which determines the annuity at the
normal retirement age.
Pension plans in the United States. The Group’s major defined benefit plans in the US have been closed to new members
since 2007. New employees in the US now join the defined contribution plan. The largest of the remaining defined benefit
plans are funded pension plans, including separate plans originating from the Nutley, Palo Alto and Indianapolis sites, together
with smaller unfunded supplementary retirement plans. The benefits are based on the highest average annual rate of earnings
during a specified period and length of employment. The plans are non-contributory for employees, with the Group making
periodic payments to the plans. In 2013 payments made by the Group were 130 million US dollars (2012: 114 million US dollars).
Where there is an under-funding this would normally be remedied by additional company contributions.
In 2013 some of the US pension plans made an offer to deferred vested members to settle the defined benefit obligation
for a lump sum payment. The total lump sum payment made from defined benefit assets was 244 million US dollars
(226 million Swiss francs), which settled an obligation of 264 million US dollars (245 million Swiss francs). This led to a gain
of 20 million US dollars (19 million Swiss francs), which is included as a settlement gain in 2013.
Past service costs in 2012 include 68 million Swiss francs of income recorded in respect of curtailments to US defined benefit
plans. This arose primarily from the reorganisation of the Pharmaceuticals Division’s Research and Development organisation,
which involved the closure of the site in Nutley, New Jersey.
Pension plans in Germany. The Group’s major pension arrangements in Germany are governed by the Occupational
Pensions Act (‘BetrAVG’). These plans are unfunded and the Group pays pensions to retired employees directly from its
own financial resources. These plans are non-contributory for employees. The benefits are based on final salary and length
of employment. These plans have been closed to new members since 2007. They have been replaced by a new plan which
is funded by regular employee and company contributions and administered through a contractual trust agreement. The final
benefit is contribution-based with a minimum guarantee. Due to this minimum guarantee, this plan is treated as a defined
benefit plan for the purposes of these IFRS financial statements, although it has many of the characteristics of a defined
contribution plan.
Past service costs in 2013 include 55 million Swiss francs of income recorded in respect of changes to the Group’s German
pension plans. This change represents the adoption of an increase in the normal retirement age.
94
Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsPension plans in the rest of the world. These represent approximately 13% of the Group’s defined benefit obligation
(2012: 13%) and consist of a number of smaller plans in various countries. Of these the largest are the pension plans at
Chugai, which are independently managed by Chugai, and the main pension plan in the United Kingdom. The Chugai plans
are fully described in Chugai’s own IFRS financial statements. The UK pension plan is funded by regular employee and
company contributions, with benefits based on final salary and length of employment. This plan has been closed to new
members since 2003 and has been replaced with a defined contribution plan.
Past service costs in 2013 include 110 million Swiss francs of income recorded in respect of changes to the Group’s UK
pension plans. This reflects a change in the indexation of pension increases to the consumer price index instead of previously
used retail price index.
Other post-employment benefit (‘OPEB’) plans. These represent approximately 6% of the Group’s defined benefit
obligation (2012: 6%) and consist mostly of post-retirement healthcare and life insurance schemes, mainly in the US. These
plans are mainly unfunded and are contributory for employees, with the Group reimbursing retired employees directly from
its own financial resources. The Group’s major defined benefit OPEB plans in the US have been closed to new members since
2011. Part of the costs of these plans is reimbursable under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization
Act of 2003. There is no statutory funding requirement for these plans. The Group is funding these plans to the extent that
it is tax efficient. In 2013 there were no payments made by the Group to these plans (2012: none). At 31 December 2013 the
IFRS funding status was 57% (2012: 51%), including reimbursement rights, for the funded OPEB plans in the US.

Funding status
The funding of the Group’s various defined benefit plans is the responsibility of a senior governing body, such as a Board
of Trustees, and the sponsoring employer, and is managed based on local statutory valuations, which follow the legislation
and requirements of the respective jurisdiction in which the plan is established. Qualified independent actuaries carry out
statutory actuarial valuations on a regular basis. The actuarial assumptions determining the funding status on the statutory
basis are regularly assessed by the local senior governing body. The funding status is closely monitored at a corporate level.
During 2013 the fair value of plan assets increased due to favourable market conditions. Higher discount rates compared
to 2012 and the changes to the pension plans in Switzerland, Germany and the UK described above resulted in a decrease
in the overall defined benefit obligation. As a result the IFRS funded status of the funded defined benefit plans improved
to 88% (2012: 81%).
Reimbursement rights are linked to the post-employment medical plans in the US and represent the expected reimbursement
of the medical expenditure provided under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.

Plan assets
The responsibility for the investment strategies of funded plans is with the senior governance body such as the Board of
Trustees. Asset-liability studies are performed regularly for all major pension plans. These studies examine the obligations
from post-retirement benefit plans, and evaluate various investment strategies with respect to key financial measures such
as expected returns, expected risks, expected contributions, and expected funded status of the plan in an interdependent
way. The goal of an asset-liability study is to select an appropriate asset allocation for the funds held within the plan. The
investment strategy is developed to optimise expected returns, to manage risks and to contain fluctuations in the statutory
funded status. Asset-liability studies include strategies to match the cash flows of the assets with the plan obligations.
The Group currently does not use annuities or longevity swaps to manage longevity risk.
Plan assets are managed using internal and external asset managers. The actual performance is continually monitored
by the pension fund governance bodies as well as being closely monitored at a corporate level. In these financial statements
the difference between the interest income and actual return on plan assets is a remeasurement that is recorded directly
to other comprehensive income. During 2013 the actual return on plan assets was a gain of 462 million Swiss francs
(2012: gain of 892 million Swiss francs).
The recognition of pension assets is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available from refunds from
the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.

Other investments which mainly consist of alternatives, mortgages and commodities. These are used for risk management
purposes and mainly have a quoted market price (Level 1 fair value hierarchy).
Included within the fair value of plan assets are the Group’s shares and non-voting securities with a fair value of 165 million
Swiss francs (2012: 109 million Swiss francs) and debt instruments issued by the Group with a fair value of 17 million Swiss
francs (2012: 44 million Swiss francs). During 2013 Swiss pension plans purchased 0.4 million Roche shares from the Group
for 95 million Swiss francs.
97
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Defined benefit obligation
The defined benefit obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method. This reflects service rendered by
employees to the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in
determining the present value of benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth and mortality rates. The present value
of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of
high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds in countries where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds.
The corporate or government bonds are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and have maturity
terms approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
The Group’s final salary-based defined benefit pension plans in the US, Germany and the United Kingdom have been closed
to new participants. Active employees that had been members of these pension plans at the time these were closed to
new participants continue to accrue benefits in the final salary-based defined benefit pension plans. New employees in the
US and UK now join the Group’s defined contribution plans, while new employees in Germany join the contribution-based
plan with a minimum guarantee. The defined benefit pension plans in Switzerland, where the final benefit is contribution-
based with a minimum guarantee, remain open to new employees. As a result, the proportion of the defined benefit
obligation which relates to these closed plans is expected to decrease in the future.

Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsActuarial assumptions
The actuarial assumptions used in these financial statements are based on the requirements set out in IAS 19 ‘Employee
Benefits’. They are unbiased and mutually compatible estimates of variables that determine the ultimate cost of providing
post-employment benefits. They are set on an annual basis by local management, based on advice from actuaries, and are
subject to approval by corporate management and the Group’s actuaries. Actuarial assumptions consist of demographic
assumptions on matters such as mortality and employee turnover, and financial assumptions on matters such as interest
rates, salary and benefit levels, inflation rates and costs of medical benefits. The actuarial assumptions vary based upon
local economic and social conditions. The actuarial assumptions used in the various statutory valuations may differ from
these based on local legal and regulatory requirements.
Demographic assumptions. The most significant demographic assumptions relate to mortality rates. The Group’s actuaries
use mortality tables which take into account historic patterns and expected changes, such as further increases in longevity.
Rates of employee turnover, disability and early retirement are based on historical behaviour within Group companies.
The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 65 is as follows:
Defined benefit plans: average life expectancy for major schemes in years
Male Female

Germany Heubeck tables 2005G 18.7 18.6 22.8 22.7
Financial assumptions. These are based on market expectations for the period over which the obligations are to be settled.
The assumptions used in the actuarial valuations are shown below.
Defined benefit plans: financial actuarial assumptions

Weighted Weighted
average Range average Range
Discount rates 3.38% 1.53%–7.20% 3.01% 1.70%–6.70%
Expected rates of salary increases 2.98% 2.00%–5.20% 3.05% 2.00%–5.25%
Expected rates of pension increases 1.03% 0.25%–2.40% 1.11% 0.25%–3.50%

Ultimate medical cost trend rate (in 2029) 4.50% 4.50% 4.50% 4.50%
Discount rates are determined with reference to interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds or government bonds in
countries where there is not a deep market in corporate bonds. Expected rates of salary increases are based on expected
inflation rates with an adjustment to reflect the Group’s latest expectation of long-term real salary increases. Expected rates
of pension increases are generally linked to the expected inflation rate. Expected inflation rates are derived by looking at
the level of inflation implied by the financial markets in conjunction with the economists’ price inflation forecasts, historic
price inflation as well as other economic variables and circumstances. Medical cost trend rates take into account the benefits
set out in the plan terms and expected future changes in medical costs. Since the Group’s major post-employment medical
plans are for US employees, these rates are driven by developments in the US.
99
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Sensitivity analysis. The measurement of the net defined benefit obligation is particularly sensitive to changes in
the discount rate, inflation rate, expected mortality and medical cost trend rate assumptions. The following table summarises
the impact of a change in those assumptions on the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
Defined benefit plans: sensitivity of defined benefit obligation to actuarial assumptions in millions of CHF
2013 2012
1 year increase in life expectancy 497 562
Discount rates
0.25% increase (570) (654)
0.25% decrease 600 701
Expected inflation rates
0.25% increase 235 205
0.25% decrease (221) (244)
Immediate medical cost trend rate
1.00% increase 112 168
1.00% decrease (94) (113)
Each sensitivity analysis considers the change in one assumption at a time leaving the other assumptions unchanged.
This approach shows the isolated effect of changing one individual assumption but does not take into account that some
assumptions are related. The method used to carry out the sensitivity analysis is the same as in the prior year.
Cash flows
The Group incurred cash flows from its defined benefit plans as shown in the table below.

Based on the most recent actuarial valuations, the Group expects that employer contributions for funded plans in 2014 will
be approximately 339 million Swiss francs, which includes an estimated 122 million Swiss francs of additional contributions,
mostly related to the US defined benefit plans. Benefits paid for unfunded plans are estimated to be approximately 137 million
Swiss francs, which mostly relate to the German defined benefit plans.

Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements26. Equity compensation plans
The Group operates several equity compensation plans, including separate plans at Chugai. IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’
requires that the fair value of all equity compensation plan awards granted to employees be estimated at grant date and
recorded as an expense over the vesting period.

Roche Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights. The Group issues Stock-settled Stock Appreciation Rights (S-SARs)
to certain directors, management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The S-SARs give employees the
right to receive non-voting equity securities reflecting the value of any appreciation in the market price of the non-voting
equity securities between the grant date and the exercise date. The S-SAR Plan regulations were restated and amended
effective 1 January 2013 (referred to as the ‘Roche S-SAR Plan’). Under the Roche S-SAR Plan, 180 million S-SARs will be
available for issuance over a ten-year period. The rights, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a seven-year
duration and vest on a phased basis over three years.

Roche Restricted Stock Unit Plan. The Group issues Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) awards to certain directors,
management and employees selected at the discretion of the Group. The RSUs, which are non-tradable, represent the right
to receive non-voting equity securities which vest only after a three-year period, subject to performance conditions, if any.
There are currently no performance conditions on outstanding RSUs at 31 December 2013. The RSU Plan regulations were
restated and amended effective 1 January 2013 (referred to as the ‘Roche RSU Plan’). Under the Roche RSU Plan 20 million
non-voting equity securities will be available for issuance over a ten-year period. The Roche RSU Plan also includes a value
adjustment which will be an amount equivalent to the sum of shareholder distributions made by the Group during the vesting
period attributable to the number of non-voting equity securities for which an individual award has been granted.

Roche Performance Share Plan. The Group offers future non-voting equity security awards (or, at the discretion of
the Board of Directors, their cash equivalent) to certain directors and key senior managers. These are non-tradable equity-
settled awards. The programme currently operates in annual three-year cycles. The Roche Performance Share Plan
regulations were restated and amended effective 1 January 2013 (referred to as the ‘Roche PSP Plan’). The Roche PSP Plan
includes a value adjustment which will be an amount equivalent to the sum of shareholder distributions made by the Group
during the vesting period attributable to the number of non-voting equity securities for which an individual award has been
granted. The amount of non-voting equity securities allocated will depend upon the individual’s salary level, the achievement
of performance targets linked to the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (shares and non-voting equity securities combined)
relative to the Group’s peers during the three-year period from the date of the grant, and the discretion of the Board of
Directors. Each award will result in between zero and two non-voting equity securities (before value adjustment), depending
upon the achievement of the performance targets.

Roche Connect. This programme enables all employees worldwide, except for those in the US and certain other countries,
to make regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting equity securities. It is administered by independent
third parties. The Group contributes to the programme, which allows the employees to purchase non-voting equity securities
at a discount (usually 20%). The administrator purchases the necessary non-voting equity securities directly from the market.
At 31 December 2013 the administrator held 2.2 million non-voting equity securities (2012: 2.3 million). In 2013 the cost
of the plan was 11 million Swiss francs (2012: 12 million Swiss francs).
Roche Option Plan. This programme is used in countries where S-SARs are not used. Awards under this plan give
employees the right to purchase non-voting equity securities at an exercise price specified at the grant date. The Roche
Option Plan regulations were restated and amended effective 1 January 2013 (referred to as the ‘Roche Option Plan’).
The options, which are non-tradable equity-settled awards, have a seven-year duration and vest on a phased basis over
three years, subject to continued employment.

Bonus Stock Awards. The Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer will be granted Bonus
Stock Awards in lieu of their cash-settled bonus for the financial year 2013. These will be issued by the end of April 2014.
The number of awards and fair value per award will be calculated at the grant date.
Chugai Stock Acquisition Rights. Chugai has Stock Acquisition Right programmes and the total fair value of the rights
issued in 2013 was equivalent to 3 million Swiss francs (2012: 2 million Swiss francs). In 2013, 3,270 rights (2012: 3,340)
were issued to employees and directors of Chugai. The rights are non-tradable equity-settled awards that have a ten-year
duration and vest after two years. Each right entitles the holder to purchase 100 Chugai shares at a specified exercise price.
In addition, 522 rights (2012: 817) were issued to the directors of Chugai that have a thirty-year duration and vest upon
the holder’s retirement as a director of Chugai. Each right entitles the holder to purchase 100 Chugai shares at an exercise
price of 100 Japanese yen.

28. Statement of cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities arise from the Group’s primary activities in the Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics
businesses. These are calculated by the indirect method by adjusting the Group’s operating profit for any operating income
and expenses that are not cash flows (for example depreciation, amortisation and impairment) in order to derive the cash
generated from operations. This and other operating cash flows are shown in the statement of cash flows. Operating cash
flows also include income taxes paid on all activities.

Cash flows from investing activities are principally those arising from the Group’s investments in property, plant and equipment
and intangible assets, and from the acquisition and divestment of subsidiaries, associates and businesses. Cash flows
connected with the Group’s portfolio of marketable securities and other investments are also included, as are any interest
and dividend payments received in respect of these securities and investments. These cash flows indicate the Group’s
net reinvestment in its operating assets and the cash flow effects of business combinations and divestments, as well as
the cash generated by the Group’s other investments.

of its equity and debt financing. Cash flows from short-term borrowings are shown as a net movement, as these consist
of a large number of transactions with short maturity.

29. Risk management
Group risk management
Risk management is a fundamental element of the Group’s business practice on all levels and encompasses different
types of risks. At a group level risk management is an integral part of the business planning and controlling processes.
Material risks are monitored and regularly discussed with the Corporate Executive Committee and the Audit Committee
of the Board of Directors.
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to various financial risks arising from its underlying operations and corporate finance activities.
The Group’s financial risk exposures are predominantly related to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and
equity prices as well as the creditworthiness and the solvency of the Group’s counterparties.
107
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies reviewed by the boards of directors of Roche or
Chugai as appropriate to their areas of statutory responsibility. These policies cover credit risk, liquidity risk and market
risk. The policies provide guidance on risk limits, type of authorised financial instruments and monitoring procedures.
As a general principle, the policies prohibit the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.
Policy implementation and day-to-day risk management are carried out by the relevant treasury functions and regular
reporting on these risks is performed by the relevant accounting and controlling functions within Roche and Chugai.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that counterparties to transactions may default on their obligations, causing financial
losses for the Group. The objective of managing counterparty credit risk is to prevent losses of liquid funds deposited with or
invested in such counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering
netting agreements and without taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements, is equal to the carrying
value of the Group’s financial assets.
Accounts receivable. At 31 December 2013 the Group has trade receivables of 9.3 billion Swiss francs (2012: 10.1 billion
Swiss francs). These are subject to a policy of active credit risk management which focuses on the assessment of country
risk, credit availability, ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures. The objective of trade receivables
management is to maximise the collection of unpaid amounts.
At 31 December 2013 the Group’s combined trade receivables balance with three US national wholesale distributors,
AmerisourceBergen Corp., McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health, Inc., was equivalent to 1.4 billion Swiss francs representing
15% of the Group’s consolidated trade receivables (2012: 1.4 billion Swiss francs representing 14%). There is no other
significant concentration of counterparty credit risk due to the Group’s large number of customers and their wide
geographical spread. Risk limits and exposures are continuously monitored by country and by the nature of counterparties.
The Group obtains credit insurance and similar enhancements when appropriate to protect the collection of trade
receivables. At 31 December 2013 no collateral was held for trade receivables (2012: none).
Since 2010 there have been financial difficulties in Southern European countries, notably Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal.
The Group is a leading supplier to the healthcare sectors in these countries and has trade receivables of 1.3 billion Swiss
francs (2012: 1.5 billion Swiss francs) with the public customers in these countries. At 31 December 2013 trade receivables
in Italy, Greece and Portugal decreased due to improved collections and in Spain remained stable compared to 2012. The
Group uses different measures to improve collections in these countries, including intense communication with customers,
factoring, negotiations of payments plans, charging of interest for late payments, and legal action.
The nature and geographic location of counterparties to accounts receivable that are not overdue or impaired are shown
in the table below. These include the balances with US national wholesalers and Southern Europe public customers
described above.

Cash and marketable securities. At 31 December 2013 the Group has cash and marketable securities of 11.9 billion Swiss
francs (2012: 14.0 billion Swiss francs). These are subject to a policy of restricting exposures to high-quality counterparties
and setting defined limits for individual counterparties. These limits and counterparty credit ratings are reviewed regularly.
Investments in marketable securities are entered into on the basis of guidelines with regard to liquidity, quality and maximum
amount. As a general rule, the Group invests only in high-quality securities with adequate liquidity. Cash and short-term time
deposits are subject to rules which limit the Group’s exposure to individual financial institutions.

Master netting agreements. The Group enters into derivative transactions and collateral agreements under International
Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements with the respective counterparties in order to mitigate
counterparty risk. Under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions
outstanding in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. The ISDA
agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the balance sheet as the Group does not have a currently enforceable
right to offset recognised amounts, because the right to offset is only enforceable on the occurrence of future events, such
as a default or other credit events.
Contract terms. At 31 December 2013 there are no significant financial assets whose terms have been renegotiated
(2012: none).
Impairment losses. During 2013 total impairment losses for available-for-sale financial assets amounted to 9 million Swiss
francs (2012: 25 million Swiss francs).
109
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises through a surplus of financial obligations over available financial assets due at any point in time. The
Group’s approach to liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient readily available reserves in order to meet its liquidity requirements
at any point in time. Roche and Chugai enjoy strong credit quality and are rated by at least one major credit rating agency.
The ratings will permit efficient access to the international capital markets in the event of major financing requirements.
At 31 December 2013 the Group has unused committed credit lines with various financial institutions totalling 5.1 billion
Swiss francs (2012: 5.1 billion Swiss francs), of which 4.8 billion Swiss francs serve as a back-stop line for the commercial
paper programme.

Market risk
Market risk arises from changing market prices, mainly foreign exchange rates and interest rates, of the Group’s financial
assets or financial liabilities which affect the Group’s financial result and equity.
Value-at-Risk. The Group uses Value-at-Risk (VaR) to measure the impact of market risk on its financial instruments.
VaR indicates the value range within which a given financial instrument will fluctuate with a pre-set probability as a result
of movements in market prices. VaR is calculated using a historical simulation approach and for each scenario, all financial
instruments are fully valued and the total change in value and earnings is determined. VaR calculations are based on a 95%
confidence level and a holding period of 20 trading days over the past ten years. This holding period reflects the time
required to change the corresponding risk exposure, should this be deemed appropriate.
Actual future gains and losses associated with our treasury activities may differ materially from the VaR analyses due to
the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes to interest rates, foreign exchange rates
and equity investment prices, particularly in periods of high market volatilities. Furthermore, VaR does not include the effect
of changes in credit spreads.

VaR – Foreign exchange component 36 50
VaR – Other price component 30 31
Diversification (61) (67)
VaR – Total market risk 297 205
The interest rate component increased mainly due to a gradual increase in long-term interest rates in major economies.
The foreign exchange component decreased due to a favourable exposure mix. The other price component arises mainly
from movements in equity security prices and remained largely stable.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group uses the Swiss franc as its reporting currency and as a result is exposed to movements in foreign currencies,
mainly the US dollar, Japanese yen and euro. The objective of the Group’s foreign exchange risk management activities is to
preserve the economic value of its current and future assets and to minimise the volatility of the Group’s financial result. The
primary focus of the Group’s foreign exchange risk management activities is on hedging transaction exposures arising through
foreign currency flows or monetary positions held in foreign currencies. The Group uses forward contracts, foreign exchange
options and cross-currency swaps to hedge transaction exposures. Application of these instruments intends to continuously
lock in favourable developments of foreign exchange rates, thereby reducing the exposure to potential future movements
in such rates.
Interest rate risk
The Group mainly raises debt on a fixed rate basis for bonds and notes. The Group is exposed to movements in interest rates,
mainly for its US dollar, Swiss franc and euro-denominated floating rate financial instruments. The primary objective of the
Group’s interest rate management is to protect the net interest result. The Group may use forward contracts, options and
swaps to hedge its interest rate exposures. Depending on the interest rate environment of major currencies, the Group will
use these instruments to generate an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposures.
Interest rate hedging. During 2013 the Group entered into the following interest rate hedging contracts:
Interest rate swap contracts for a combined notional principal of 2.0 billion US dollars. These swapped the fixed interest
rate of 6.0% to an effective floating interest rate of 3 months USD-LIBOR plus an average spread of 4.74%. The maturity
of the swaps is 1 March 2019.
Interest rate swap contracts for a combined notional principal of 100 million Swiss francs. These swapped the fixed interest
rate of 1.0% to an effective floating interest rate of 6 months CHF-LIBOR plus an average spread of 0.21%. The maturity
of the swaps is 21 September 2018.
Other price risk
Other price risk arises mainly from movements in the prices of equity securities. The Group manages the price risk through
placing limits on individual and total equity investments. These limits are defined both as a percentage of total liquid funds
and as an absolute number for individual equity investments.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Capital management
The Group defines the capital that it manages as the Group’s total capitalisation, being the sum of debt plus equity, including
non-controlling interests. The Group’s objectives when managing capital are:
To safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide benefits for patients
and returns to investors.
To provide an adequate return to investors based on the level of risk undertaken.
To have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver future benefits
for patients and returns to investors.
To maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The capitalisation is reported to senior management as part of the Group’s regular internal management reporting and
is shown in the table below.

Capitalisation 39,884 41,340 41,359
As disclosed in Note 32, the total equity at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 has been restated following the accounting policy changes which were adopted
in 2013. A reconciliation to the previously published total equity is provided in Note 32.
The Group’s net equity was significantly impacted by the 2009 Genentech transaction (see Note 21).
The Group is not subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements as known in the financial services industry. The Group
has a majority shareholding in Chugai (see Note 22). Chugai is a public company and its objectives, policies and processes
for managing its own capital are determined by local management.

Level 1 financial assets consist of treasury bills, bonds and quoted shares. Level 2 financial assets consist primarily of
commercial paper, certificates of deposit and derivative financial instruments.
The Group determines Level 2 fair values using the following valuation techniques:
Marketable securities and derivative financial instruments are based on valuation models that use observable market data
for interest rates, yield curves, foreign exchange rates and implied volatilities for similar instruments at the measurement
date.
Available-for-sale investments using a valuation model derived from the most recently published observable financial
prices.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period during which
the transfer has occurred. There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and vice versa during the year
(2012: none).

Contingent consideration arrangements
The Group is party to certain contingent consideration arrangements arising from business combination arrangements.
The fair value is determined considering the expected payment, discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted discount
rate of 4.6%. The expected payments are determined by considering the possible scenarios of forecast sales or other
performance criteria, the amount to be paid under each scenario, and the probability of each scenario. The significant
unobservable inputs are the forecast sales or other performance criteria and the risk-adjusted discount rate. The estimated
fair value would increase if the forecast sales or other performance criteria rate was higher or the risk-adjusted discount
rate was lower. At 31 December 2013 the payments under contingent consideration arrangements could be up to 303 million
Swiss francs.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group has entered into various currency swaps for certain non-US dollar debt instruments. Cash collateral agreements
were entered into with the counterparties to the currency swaps to mitigate counterparty risk. The following table sets out
the carrying value of derivative financial instruments and the amounts that are subject to master netting agreements.

Hedge accounting
At 31 December 2013 the Group has the following cash flow hedges and fair value hedges which are designated in
a qualifying hedge relationship.
Cash flow hedges. The Group has entered into cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk
on some of the bonds and notes issued by the Group which are denominated in euros and sterling. At 31 December 2013
such instruments are recorded as fair value assets of 513 million Swiss francs (2012: assets of 418 million Swiss francs).
There was no ineffective portion.
During 2012 the Group entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a part of its foreign translation exposure to
euros. During 2013 the remaining foreign exchange forward contracts matured resulting in a loss of 34 million Swiss francs
recorded in the income statement. At 31 December 2012 such instruments were recorded as fair value liabilities of 10 million
Swiss francs.
Chugai has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a part of its foreign translation exposure to Swiss
francs and US dollars. At 31 December 2013 such instruments are recorded as fair value assets of 57 million Swiss francs
(2012: assets of 1 million Swiss francs). There was no ineffective portion.
The expected undiscounted cash flows from qualifying cash flow hedges, including interest payments during the duration
of the derivative contract and final settlement on maturity, are shown in the table below.

Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsThe changes in the hedging reserve within equity are shown in Note 21.
Fair value hedges. The Group has entered into some interest rate swaps to hedge some of its fixed-term debt instruments.
At 31 December 2013 such instruments are recorded as fair value liabilities of 59 million Swiss francs and fair value assets
of 2 million Swiss francs (2012: assets of 5 million Swiss francs). During 2013 a loss of 62 million Swiss francs was recorded
on these interest rate swaps (2012: loss of 4 million Swiss francs). As the fair value hedge had been highly effective since
inception, the result of the interest rate swaps was largely offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debt instruments.
The Group has equity investments in various biotechnology companies that are subject to a greater risk of market fluctuation
than the stock market in general. To manage part of this exposure the Group has entered into forward contracts, which have
been designated and qualify as fair value hedges. At 31 December 2013 such instruments are recorded as fair value liabilities
of 270 million Swiss francs (2012: liabilities of 106 million Swiss francs). During 2013 a loss of 164 million Swiss francs was
recorded on these forward contracts (2012: loss of 44 million Swiss francs). The result of the forward contracts is offset by
the changes in the fair value of the hedged equity investments.
Net investment hedges. The Group does not have any net investment hedges.

Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 201332. Significant accounting policies
Consolidation policy
Subsidiaries are all companies (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity
when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to
affect those returns through its power over the entity. Companies acquired during the year are consolidated from the date
on which control is transferred to the Group, and subsidiaries to be divested are included up to the date on which control
passes from the Group. Inter-company balances, transactions and resulting unrealised income are eliminated in full. Changes
in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has already been
obtained and if they do not result in a loss of control. Associates are companies over which the Group exercises, or has the
power to exercise, significant influence, but which it does not control and they are accounted for using the equity method.
Segment reporting
For the purpose of segment reporting the Group’s Corporate Executive Committee (CEC) is considered to be the Group’s
Chief Operating Decision Maker. The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on the organisation units
for which information is reported to the CEC on a regular basis. The information provided is used as the basis of the segment
revenue and profit disclosures reported in Note 2, with the geographic analysis based on the location of customers. Selected
segment balance sheet information is also routinely provided to the CEC.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis. Operating assets and liabilities consist
of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade receivables/payables, inventories and other assets
and liabilities, such as provisions, which can be reasonably attributed to the reported operating segments. Non-operating
assets and liabilities mainly include current and deferred income tax balances, post-employment benefit assets/liabilities
and financial assets/liabilities such as cash, marketable securities, investments and debt.
Foreign currency translation
The Annual Financial Statements are presented in Swiss francs. Most Group companies use their local currency as their
functional currency. Certain Group companies use other currencies (such as US dollars, Swiss francs or euros) as their
functional currency where this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Local
transactions in other currencies are initially reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Gains and losses
from the settlement of such transactions and gains and losses on translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in other currencies are included in income, except when they are qualifying cash flow hedges or arise on monetary items
that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign entity. In such cases the gains and losses are deferred
into other comprehensive income.
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of Group companies using functional currencies other than Swiss francs
are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of exchange. The income statement and statement of cash flows are
translated at the average rates of exchange for the year. Translation differences due to the changes in exchange rates
between the beginning and the end of the year and the difference between net income translated at the average and year-
end exchange rates are taken directly to other comprehensive income.
124
Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsRevenues
Sales represent amounts received and receivable for goods supplied to customers after deducting trade discounts, cash
discounts and volume rebates, and exclude value added taxes and other taxes directly linked to sales. Revenues from the sale
of products are recognised upon transfer to the customer of significant risks and rewards. Trade discounts, cash discounts
and volume rebates are recorded on an accrual basis consistent with the recognition of the related sales. Estimates of
expected sales returns, charge-backs and other rebates, including Medicaid in the US and similar rebates in other countries,
are also deducted from sales and recorded as accrued liabilities or provisions or as a deduction from accounts receivable.
Such estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual or legislatively mandated obligations, historical trends and the
Group’s experience. If the circumstances are such that the level of sales returns, and hence revenues, cannot be reliably
measured, then sales are only recognised when the right of return expires, which is generally upon prescription of the
products to patients. Other revenues are recorded as earned or as the services are performed. Single transactions are split
into separately identifiable components to reflect the substance of the transaction, where necessary. Conversely, two or
more transactions may be considered together for revenue recognition purposes, where the commercial effect cannot be
understood without reference to the series of transactions as a whole.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and related production overheads of goods sold and
services rendered. Royalties, alliance and collaboration expenses, including all collaboration profit-sharing arrangements are
also reported as part of cost of sales. Start-up costs between validation and the achievement of normal production capacity
are expensed as incurred.
Research and development
Internal research and development activities are expensed as incurred for the following:
Internal research costs incurred for the purpose of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.
Internal development costs incurred for the application of research findings or other knowledge to plan and develop
new products for commercial production. The development projects undertaken by the Group are subject to technical,
regulatory and other uncertainties, such that, in the opinion of management, the criteria for capitalisation as intangible
assets are not met prior to obtaining marketing approval by the regulatory authorities in major markets.
Post-marketing studies after regulatory approval, such as phase IV costs in the pharmaceuticals business, generally
involve safety surveillance and ongoing technical support of a drug after it receives marketing approval to be sold.
They may be required by regulatory authorities or may be undertaken for safety or commercial reasons. The costs of such
post-marketing studies are not capitalised as intangible assets, as in the opinion of management, they do not generate
separately identifiable incremental future economic benefits that can be reliably measured.
Acquired in-process research and development resources obtained through in-licensing arrangements, business
combinations or separate asset purchases are capitalised as intangible assets. The acquired asset must be controlled by
the Group, be separately identifiable and expected to generate future economic benefits, even if uncertainty exists as to
whether the research and development will ultimately result in a marketable product. Consequently, upfront and milestone
payments to third parties for pharmaceutical products or compounds before regulatory marketing approval are recognised
as intangible assets. Assets acquired through such arrangements are measured on the basis set out in the ‘Intangible assets’
policy. Subsequent internal research and development costs incurred post-acquisition are treated in the same way as other
internal research and development costs. If research and development are embedded in contracts for strategic alliances,
the Group carefully assesses whether upfront or milestone payments constitute funding of research and development work
or acquisition of an asset.
125
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Licensing, milestone and other upfront receipts
Royalty income is recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the respective licensing agreements.
If the collectability of a royalty amount is not reasonably assured, those royalties are recognised as revenue when the cash
is received. Certain Group companies receive upfront, milestone and other similar payments from third parties relating to
the sale or licensing of products or technology. Revenue associated with performance milestones is recognised based on
achievement of the deliverables as defined in the respective agreements. Upfront payments and licence fees for which there
are subsequent deliverables are initially reported as deferred income and are recognised in income as earned over the period
of the development collaboration or the manufacturing obligation.
Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits include wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, profit
sharing and bonuses, and non-monetary benefits for current employees. The costs are recognised within the operating
results when the employee has rendered the associated service. The Group recognises a liability for profit sharing and
bonuses where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Long-term employee benefits include long-service or sabbatical leave, long-service benefits and long-term disability
benefits. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment. Any changes in the carrying value
of other long-term employee benefit liabilities are recognised within the operating results.
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or
whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. Termination costs are recognised at
the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of the benefits or when the Group recognises any related
restructuring costs.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
For defined contribution plans the Group contributions are recognised within the operating results when the employee
has rendered the associated service. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund
or a reduction in future payments is available.
For defined benefit plans the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation
less the fair value of the plan assets. All changes in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as they occur as follows:
Recognised in the income statement:
Current service costs are charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating results.
Past service costs, including curtailment gains or losses, are recognised immediately in general and administration within
the operating results.
Settlement gains or losses are recognised in general and administration within the operating results.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is recognised in financing costs.
Recognised in other comprehensive income:
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments (the difference between previous assumptions and what
has actually occurred) and changes in actuarial assumptions.
The return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability.
Any change in the limit on the recognition of plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined
benefit liability.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is comprised of interest income on plan assets, interest cost on the defined
benefit obligation and interest on the effect of the limit on the recognition of pension assets. The net interest is calculated
using the same discount rate that is used in calculating the defined benefit obligation, applied to the net defined liability
at the start of the period, taking account of any changes from contribution or benefit payments.
126
Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsPension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit plans are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right
to use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan.
Equity compensation plans
The fair value of all equity compensation awards granted to employees is estimated at the grant date and recorded as an
expense over the vesting period. The expense is charged to the appropriate income statement heading within the operating
results. For equity-settled plans, an increase in equity is recorded for this expense and any subsequent cash flows from
exercises of vested awards are recorded as changes in equity.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction, and include all costs directly
attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner
intended by management. These include items such as costs of site preparation, installation and assembly costs and
professional fees. The net costs of testing whether the asset is functioning properly, including validation costs, are also
included in the initially recorded cost of construction. Interest and other borrowing costs incurred with respect to qualifying
assets are capitalised and included in the carrying value of the assets. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a
straight-line basis, except for land, which is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives of major classes of depreciable assets
are as follows:
Land improvements 40 years
Buildings 10–50 years
Machinery and equipment 4–15 years
Diagnostic instruments 3–5 years
Office equipment 3–6 years
Motor vehicles 5–8 years
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate
components. The estimated useful lives of the assets are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation
charges are accelerated. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Leases
Where the Group is the lessee. Finance leases exist when substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are
transferred to the Group. Finance leases are capitalised at the start of the lease at fair value, or the present value of the
minimum lease payments, if lower. The rental obligation, net of finance charges, is reported within debt. Finance lease assets
are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its useful life. The interest element of the lease payment is charged
against income over the lease term based on the effective interest rate method. Operating leases exist when substantially all
of the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group. Payments made under operating leases are charged
against income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where the Group is the lessor. Certain assets, mainly Diagnostics instruments, are leased to third parties through both
finance and operating lease arrangements. Finance lease assets are reported as receivables at an amount equal to the net
investment in the lease. Lease income from finance leases is recognised over the term of the lease based on the effective
interest rate method. Operating lease assets are reported within property, plant and equipment. Lease income from
operating leases is recognised over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
127
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. At the date of acquisition the Group
initially recognises the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest
in the acquired business. The consideration transferred is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. Where the Group
does not acquire 100% ownership of the acquired business, non-controlling interests are recorded either at fair value or
as the proportion of the fair value of the acquired net assets attributable to the non-controlling interest. Directly attributable
acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred within general and administration expenses.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises in a business combination and is the excess of the consideration transferred to acquire the business over
the underlying fair value of the net identified assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least
annually and upon the occurrence of an indication of impairment.
Intangible assets
Purchased patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Assets that have been
acquired through a business combination are initially recorded at fair value. Once available for use, intangible assets
are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting
date. The estimated useful life is the lower of the legal duration and the economic useful life. The estimated useful lives
of intangible assets are regularly reviewed. Estimated useful lives of major classes of amortisable intangible assets are
as follows:
Product intangibles in use 4–20 years
Marketing intangibles in use 2–5 years
Technology intangibles in use 7–14 years
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
An impairment assessment is carried out when there is evidence that an asset may be impaired. In addition intangible
assets that are not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. When the recoverable amount of an asset, being
the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value is
reduced to its recoverable amount. This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. Value in use is
calculated using estimated cash flows, generally over a five-year period, with extrapolating projections for subsequent years.
These are discounted using an appropriate long-term interest rate. When an impairment loss arises, the useful life of the
asset is reviewed and, if necessary, the future depreciation/amortisation charge is accelerated. If the amount of impairment
loss subsequently decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was
recognised, then the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the income statement as an impairment
reversal.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is assessed for impairment at each reporting date and is additionally tested annually for impairment. Goodwill is
allocated to cash-generating units and when the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit, being the higher of its fair
value less costs to sell or its value in use, is less than its carrying value, then the carrying value of the goodwill is reduced
to its recoverable amount. This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. The impairment testing
methodology is further described in Note 8.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of finished goods and work in process includes
raw materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs and overheads based upon the normal capacity of
production facilities. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling
price less cost to completion and selling expenses.
128
Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsAccounts receivable
Accounts receivable are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts, trade discounts,
cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded where there is
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due. These estimates are based on specific indicators,
such as the ageing of customer balances, specific credit circumstances and the Group’s historical experience, taking also
into account economic conditions. Expenses for doubtful trade receivables are recognised within marketing and distribution
expenses. Trade discounts, cash discounts, volume rebates and similar allowances are recorded on an accrual basis
consistent with the recognition of the related sales, using estimates based on existing contractual obligations, historical trends
and the Group’s experience.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and time, call and current balances with banks and similar institutions.
Such balances are only reported as cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject
to insignificant risk of changes in their fair value and have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will probably lead to an
outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated. In particular, restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group
has a detailed formal plan that has either commenced implementation or has been announced. Provisions are recorded
for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise and are discounted when the time value of money is material.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events or where
the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability. Contingent assets are not recognised,
but are disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.
Fair values
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. It is determined by reference to quoted market prices or by the use of
established valuation techniques such as option pricing models and the discounted cash flow method if quoted prices
in an active market are not available.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are classified into the following categories which are disclosed in Note 29.
Available-for-sale. These are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated as such or are not classified
in any other financial asset category. Available-for-sale assets are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value.
Changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income, except for impairments and interest and foreign exchange
components. When an investment is derecognised the cumulative gains and losses in equity are reclassified to financial
income (expense). Available-for-sale assets are mainly comprised of marketable securities.
Fair value – hedging instruments. These are derivative financial instruments that are used to manage the exposures
to foreign currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks. Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded and
subsequently carried at fair value. Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments,
all changes in fair value are recorded as other financial income (expense).
Fair value – designated. These are non-derivative financial instruments that are designated as fair value through profit or
loss on initial recognition. Designated fair value instruments are initially recorded and subsequently carried at fair value with
changes in fair value recorded in the income statement. Designated fair value instruments are mainly comprised of contingent
consideration liabilities with changes in fair value recorded in general and administration within the operating results.
129
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Loans and receivables. These are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted
in an active market. Loans and receivables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost
using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment losses. Loans and receivables are mainly comprised of accounts
receivable and cash and cash equivalents.
Other financial liabilities. These are non-derivative financial liabilities. Other financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair
value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Other financial liabilities are mainly
comprised of debt and trade payables.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual cash flows from the asset expire or when the Group transfers
the rights to receive the contractual cash flows from the financial assets in a transaction in which substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when the contractual
obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are individually assessed for possible impairment at each reporting date. An impairment charge is recorded
where there is objective evidence of impairment, such as where the issuer is in bankruptcy, default or other significant
financial difficulty. Available-for-sale equity securities that have a market value of more than 25% below their original cost,
or have a market value below their original cost for a sustained six-month period will be considered as impaired.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, any impairment charge is the difference between the carrying value and
the recoverable amount, calculated using estimated future cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate.
For available-for-sale financial assets, any impairment charge is the amount currently carried in other comprehensive income
for the difference between the original cost and the fair value.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss
was recognised. For debt securities measured at amortised cost or available-for-sale, the reversal is recognised in income.
For equity securities held as available-for-sale, the reversal is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Hedge accounting
The Group uses derivatives to manage its exposures to foreign currency, interest rate, equity market and credit risks.
The instruments used may include interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, forwards contracts and options. The Group
generally limits the use of hedge accounting to certain significant transactions. To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging
relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and
reliability of measurement. While many of these transactions can be considered as hedges in economic terms, if the required
conditions are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instrument
and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship, which means that any derivatives
are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial income (expense).
Cash flow hedge. This is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss. The hedging
instrument is recorded at fair value. The effective portion of the hedge is included in other comprehensive income and any
ineffective portion is reported in financial income (expense). If the hedging relationship is the hedge of the foreign currency
risk of a firm commitment or highly probable forecasted transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial item,
the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive income
are included in the initial carrying value of the non-financial item at the date of recognition. For all other cash flow hedges,
the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in other comprehensive income
are included in financial income (expense) when the forecasted transaction affects net income.
130
Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial StatementsFair value hedge. This is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or an
unrecognised firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable
to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss. The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged item
is recorded at its previous carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair value that are attributable to the hedged risk.
Changes in the fair values are reported in financial income (expense).
Debt
Debt instruments are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Subsequently they
are reported at amortised cost. Any discount between the net proceeds received and the principal value due on redemption
is amortised over the duration of the debt instrument and is recognised as part of financing costs using the effective interest
rate method.
Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding taxes payable on
the distribution of retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based on income, such as property and capital taxes,
are included within general and administration expenses.
Liabilities for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally
relating to subsidiaries, are only recognised where it is probable that such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their carrying values. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be
available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied by the same taxation authority
and when there is a legally enforceable right to offset them. Deferred taxes are determined based on the currently enacted
tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction where the Group operates.
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity. The original purchase cost,
consideration received for subsequent resale of these equity instruments and other movements are reported as changes
in equity. These instruments are held for the Group’s potential conversion obligations that may arise from the Group’s equity
compensation plans.
Changes in accounting policies
The Group has adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards, including any consequential
amendments to other standards, with a date of initial application of 1 January 2013.
IAS 19 (revised) ‘Employee Benefits’
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’
IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’
Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income (Amendments to IAS 1)
Annual Improvements to IFRS 2009–2011 cycle, 2010–2012 cycle and 2011–2013 cycle
With the exception of the revisions to IAS 19, these do not have a material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial
position. The nature and the effects of the changes most relevant to the Group’s financial statements are explained below.
131
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Pensions and other post-employment benefits. As a result of IAS 19 (revised) the Group amended its accounting policy
with respect to the basis for determining the income or expense related to defined benefit plans and restated the 2012
results retrospectively. The main changes are as follows:
The revised standard eliminated the option to defer the recognition of actuarial gains and losses from defined benefit plans,
known as the ‘corridor method’. The Group did not apply this option, but rather uses the option to recognise such gains
and losses directly in other comprehensive income. The option currently applied by the Group is the requirement under the
revised standard and therefore this change had no impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is comprised of interest income on plan assets, interest cost on the defined
benefit obligation and interest on the effect of the limit on the recognition of pension assets. The net interest is calculated
using the same discount rate that is used in calculating the defined benefit obligation, applied to the net defined liability
at the start of the period, taking account of any changes from contribution or benefit payments. Previously, expected
income on plan assets was based on the estimated long-term rate of the underlying assets in the various plans. The impact
on the restated 2012 results was a reduction in net financial income of 164 million Swiss francs for the year ended 31
December 2012. The ongoing impact for 2013 and beyond is expected to be of a similar magnitude. There was no impact
on the Group’s operating income or net assets from this change.
Past service costs are now recognised immediately in the income statement in the period of a plan amendment.
Previously, past service costs had the portion related to unvested benefits deferred on the balance sheet, which was
then progressively released. The impact of this change was an increase in the Group’s net assets by 22 million Swiss francs
at 31 December 2012 and an increase of 24 million Swiss francs at 31 December 2011.
Following the revision to IAS 19 disclosed above the Group has also made a presentational change to the income statement,
which has renamed ‘Financial income’ to ‘Other financial income (expense)’ and moved this caption below ‘Financing costs’.
The reconciliations between the results published previously in 2012 (using the previous accounting policy) and the restated
amounts which are reported as comparatives in 2013 (using the revised accounting policy) are presented below.

Total equity 16,728 22 16,750 14,482 24 14,506
Consolidation policy. As a result of IFRS 10, the Group has amended its accounting policy for determining whether it has
control over and consequently whether it consolidates its investees. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed
to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through
its power over the entity. This change had no impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Fair values. IFRS 13 establishes a single framework for measuring fair value and making disclosures about fair value
measurements, when such measurements are required or permitted by other IFRSs. IFRS 13 unifies the definition of fair
value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. It also replaces and expands the disclosure requirements about fair value
measurements in other IFRSs, including IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. In accordance with the transitional
provisions of IFRS 13, the Group has applied the new fair value measurement guidance prospectively, and has not provided
all of the comparative information for new disclosures. The change had no impact on the measurements of the Group’s
assets and liabilities.
133
Roche Group – Notes to the Roche Group Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Presentation of items of other comprehensive income. As a result of the amendments to IAS 1, the Group has modified
the presentation of items of other comprehensive income in its consolidated statement of comprehensive income, to
present separately items that may be reclassified to the income statement in the future from those that would not. The 2012
comparative information has been restated for this change. The change had no impact on the Group’s overall results and
financial position.
Future new and revised standards
The Group is currently assessing the potential impacts of other new and revised standards and interpretations that will be
effective from 1 January 2014 and beyond. Based on the analysis to date, the Group does not anticipate that these will have
a material impact on the Group’s overall results and financial position.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
control over financial reporting. The internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance over the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems
determined to be effective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management assessed the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2013
based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
version 1992 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on
this assessment, management has concluded that the system of internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of 31 December 2013.
The Statutory Auditor KPMG AG has audited the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year
ended 31 December 2013, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and with the International Standards on Auditing
(ISA). They have also issued a report on the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control over financial reporting.
This report is set out on pages 138 to 139.

Roche Group – Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting | Roche Finance Report 2013Report of the Statutory Auditor on
the Consolidated Financial Statements
Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Consolidated Financial Statements to the Annual General Meeting
of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
As statutory auditor, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, which
comprise the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, statement
of changes in equity and notes on pages 46 to 134 for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Board of Directors’ Responsibility. The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and
the requirements of Swiss law. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control
system relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying
appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s Responsibility. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law, Swiss Auditing Standards and International Standards
on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks
of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of
the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 give a true and fair view
of the financial position, the results of operations and the cash flows in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), and comply with Swiss law.
136
Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Consolidated Financial StatementsReport on Other Legal Requirements
We confirm that we meet the legal requirements on licensing according to the Auditor Oversight Act (AOA) and independence
(article 728 CO and article 11 AOA) and that there are no circumstances incompatible with our independence.
In accordance with article 728a paragraph 1 item 3 CO and Swiss Auditing Standard 890, we confirm that an internal control
system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of consolidated financial statements according to the instructions
of the Board of Directors.
We recommend that the consolidated financial statements submitted to you be approved.

Roche Group – Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Consolidated Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013Report of the Independent Auditor on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Report of the Independent Auditor on Internal Control over Financial Reporting to the Annual General Meeting
of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
We have examined the Roche Group’s system of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2013, based
on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework version 1992 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
The Board of Directors and management of Roche Holding Ltd are responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as included
in the accompanying Report of Roche Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our examination. An entity’s internal
control over financial reporting is a process effected by the entity’s Board of Directors, management, and other personnel,
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial statements prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding the prevention or timely detection of the unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that
could have a material effect on the entity’s financial statements.
We conducted our examination in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000).
This standard requires that we plan and perform our examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our examination included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of management
override of controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation
of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that internal control may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
138
Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Group – Report of the Independent Auditor on Internal Control over Financial ReportingIn our opinion, the Roche Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of 31 December 2013 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework version 1992 issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We also have audited, in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and International Standards on Auditing,
the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd for the year ended 31 December 2013 and our report dated
27 January 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Roche Group – Multi-Year Overview and Supplementary Information | Roche Finance Report 2013Supplementary Core results and EPS information
The Group’s basic and diluted earnings per share is given in Note 27 to the Annual Financial Statements. To allow
for a transparent assessment of both the actual results and the underlying performance of the business the full income
statement for the Group and the operating results of the divisions are shown on both an IFRS and core basis.
The core results concept, which is used in the internal management of the business, is based on the IFRS results,
with the following adjustments:
Global restructuring plans (see Note 6) are excluded.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets (see Note 9) and impairment of goodwill (see Note 8) are excluded.
Acquisition accounting and other one-time impacts from Alliance arrangements and Business Combinations (see Financial
Review) are excluded.
Discontinued operations (currently none) would be excluded.
Legal and environmental expenses (see Financial Review) are excluded.
Global issues outside the healthcare sector beyond the Group’s control (currently none) would be excluded.
Material one-time treasury items such as major debt restructurings (currently none) would be excluded.
Pension plan settlements (see Note 25) are excluded.
The tax benefit recorded under IFRS in respect of Equity Compensation Plans (ECPs), which varies according to price
of the underlying equity, is replaced by a normalised tax benefit, being the IFRS 2 expense multiplied by the applicable tax
rate (see Note 4).
The core results concept was further described on 22 October 2010 at an Investor Update teleconference, which is available
for download at: http://www.roche.com/investors/ir_agenda/csr_151010.htm
The Group’s IFRS results, including the divisional breakdown, are reconciled to the core results in the tables below.
The calculation of core EPS is also given in the tables below. Additional commentary to the adjustment items is given
in the Financial Review.

The Group has refined the calculation of free cash flow in 2013 to exclude the impact of employee stock options in line with its peer group. As a result the operating
profit cash adjustments for the year ended 31 December 2012 have been restated to exclude the net cash flow from equity-settled compensation plans. This resulted
in an increase of 746 million Swiss francs in the Group operating profit cash adjustments for the year ended 31 December 2012. The divisional impacts were increases
of 658 million Swiss francs in Pharmaceuticals, 64 million Swiss francs in Diagnostics and 24 million Swiss francs in Corporate.

Bonus Stock Awards. The Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer will be granted Bonus Stock
Awards in lieu of their cash-settled bonus for the financial year 2013. These will be issued by the end of April 2014 with a
total fair value for the employee of 3,909 thousand Swiss francs. The fair value of these awards for the employee is calculated
taking into account the period in which they are blocked (3 years: 83.962%, 10 years: 55.839%). The number of awards
and fair value per award will be calculated at the grant date.
Employer contribution to social security schemes and pension plans. The Group pays social insurance contributions
in respect of the above remuneration and pays contributions to pension and other post-employment benefit plans for
the Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate Executive Committee.
Equity Compensation Plans. The Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate Executive Committee
also participate in certain equity compensation plans as described below. The terms and vesting conditions of these awards
are disclosed in Note 26 to the Roche Group Annual Financial Statements. The fair values used in the Roche Group Annual
Financial Statements represent the cost to the company at grant date and reflect amongst other matters the observed
exercise behaviour and exit rate for the whole population that receive the awards and initial simulations of any performance
conditions. For the purposes of these remuneration disclosures the values are calculated based on the fair value that the
employee receives taking into account the preliminary assessment of any completed performance conditions.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of the Corporate Executive Committee are eligible to participate in
Roche Connect, a programme that enables employees to make regular deductions from their salaries to purchase non-voting
equity securities. The Group contributes to the programme, which allows the employees to purchase non-voting equity
securities at a discount (usually 20%).
During 2013 members of the Corporate Executive Committee were granted 201,921 Stock-settled Stock Appreciation
Rights (S-SARs). The individual awards relating to 2013 are shown in the table below. The fair value of these awards for
the employees was 7,345 thousand Swiss francs, which was calculated using the Trinomial model for American options.
159
Roche Holding Ltd, Basel – Notes to the Financial Statements | Roche Finance Report 2013During 2013 members of the Corporate Executive Committee were granted 19,838 Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).
The individual awards relating to 2013 are shown in the table below. The fair value of these awards for the employees was
3,249 thousand Swiss francs, which was calculated based on the average market non-voting equity security price over
the 90-day period prior to the grant date.
Members of the Corporate Executive Committee and other members of senior management participate in the Roche
Performance Share Plan (PSP). The Group has three overlapping three-year PSPs. The target awards for the three-year
cycle are defined at the beginning of the cycle and the awards are considered to form part of the employee’s remuneration
in three equal annual amounts over the three-year cycle. Each award will result in between zero and two non-voting equity
securities, depending upon the achievement of the performance targets and the discretion of the Board of Directors.
The individual awards relating to 2013 are shown in the table below. The number of the awards is calculated as follows:
PSP 2011–2013: At the end of the cycle the performance targets were achieved and accordingly the participants received
175% of the originally targeted non-voting equity securities.
PSP 2012–2014: One non-voting equity security per award.
PSP 2013–2015: One non-voting equity security per award.
The resulting allocations are multiplied by the non-voting equity security price at 31 December 2013 of 249.20 Swiss francs
to give the fair value for the remuneration received by the employee.

Roche Finance Report 2013 | Roche Holding Ltd, Basel – Appropriation of Available EarningsReport of the Statutory Auditor
on the Financial Statements
Report of the Statutory Auditor on the Financial Statements to the Annual General Meeting
of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
As statutory auditor, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd, which comprise
the income statement, balance sheet and notes on pages 154 to 164 for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Board of Directors’ Responsibility. The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements
in accordance with the requirements of Swiss law and the company’s Articles of Incorporation. This responsibility includes
designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting
and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.
Auditor’s Responsibility. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor
considers the internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the entity’s internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion.
Opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2013 comply with Swiss law and
the company’s Articles of Incorporation.

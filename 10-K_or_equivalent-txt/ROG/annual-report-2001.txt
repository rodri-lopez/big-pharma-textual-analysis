Overall, 2001 was a successful year for Roche despite
numerous challenges. This is reflected particularly by the
markedly improved operating results reported by our core
pharmaceuticals and diagnostics businesses. During the
year we also announced our intention to acquire a majority
interest in Japan’s Chugai Pharmaceutical, an alliance that
will make us a leading player in the world’s second-largest
pharmaceuticals market. On the negative side, past anti-
competitive practices in the vitamins industry had further
repercussions. On a comparable basis, consolidated sales
rose 8% for the year in local currencies and 6% in Swiss
francs to over 29 billion Swiss francs. Two particularly

operating profit, to 4.8 billion Swiss francs, and the
improvement in the Group’s operating profit margin,
which reached 16.4%.As a result of an expected decline
in financial income and higher tax expenses, adjusted
net income fell 4% to 4.8 billion Swiss francs. Roche once
again recorded a strong positive cash flow and remains
very solidly financed. Including the many special items
recorded in 2000 and 2001, reported net income declined

Pharmaceuticals
After a difficult start in the first three months, sales of our prescription medicines
grew faster than the global market in the last three quarters of 2001. Growth was
fuelled primarily by our extremely successful oncology franchise and a number of
other leading products. This more than compensated for lost sales resulting from
expiry of the US patent on Versed/Dormicum.An important milestone was reached
with the launch of Pegasys for hepatitis C in its first markets.
Our restructuring programme,‘Re-shaping for Future Growth’, has accelerated
the growth of our prescription drug sales while reducing costs, and last year
already had a positive impact on the profitability of our pharmaceuticals business.
In December Roche and Chugai announced an alliance to create a leading
research-driven pharmaceutical company in Japan. Roche will hold a 50.1%
majority interest in the company, which will rank fifth in sales in the world’s
second largest pharmaceuticals market.

In 2001 Roche Diagnostics again posted double-digit growth rates well above
the market average.As a result, the division expanded its lead in each of the
market segments and national markets it serves. The rollout of new products for
customers – ranging from high-workload laboratories to individual consumers –
had a positive impact on sales, and the division’s operating profit margin also
showed a year-on-year gain. From this position of strength, Roche last year
implemented major initiatives pointing the way forward to a new dimension in
medical diagnostics.With its business areas focused tightly on customers, Roche
Diagnostics can now be even more responsive to market needs. The alliance
with Iceland’s deCode Genetics to develop new, gene-based diagnostic systems
marks another important step for Roche on the road to more individualised
healthcare.

Vitamins and Fine Chemicals
The Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division is the world’s leading supplier of
health-promoting active ingredients for the feed, food, pharmaceuticals and
cosmetics industries.However,the division’s performance is closely linked to
that of its customer industries, which are currently experiencing a slowdown
in their markets.
While vitamins and, to an even greater extent, carotenoids were once again
subject to significant pricing pressures in 2001, these were offset by increased
volume sales of some vitamins and rising sales revenues for a number of
products, particularly enzymes and new product entries. Excluding the medicinal
feed additives products, which were sold in May 2000, sales of the division
increased moderately. The division’s operating profit margin declined 3.9 per-
centage points to 9.8%. Consequently, efforts to improve profitability have been
stepped up. The division’s operating profit margin for 2001 was higher than
the average for comparable competitors.
Now that major parts of the vitamin case have been resolved, we are currently
reviewing strategic alternatives for this business.

approach is to optimise treatment.
With an HER2 gene test, doctors can
determine which patients will benefit
from treatment with the breast cancer
drug Herceptin before writing a pre-
scription.
Our goal is to develop integrated healthcare solutions that go far
beyond today’s diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities — solu-
tions that will make it possible to detect predispositions and very
early-stage disease and stop them from progressing. In addition,
this approach promises fine-tuned, individualised treatment and

Health Information
Thanks to its strong presence in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics, Roche is in a
powerful position to develop individualised diagnosis and therapy solutions.
Since the first disease management projects focusing mainly on viral diseases
(HIV and hepatitis C) were initiated between 1996 and 1998, Roche has developed
innovative programmes for a variety of clinical conditions.
In 2001, as part of our ongoing efforts to help meet the challenges facing modern
medicine, the Integrated Cancer Care Unit was set up to speed the development
of novel cancer care solutions. In addition, a cross-divisional committee was
established to coordinate activities in genetics and promote knowledge transfer
and development in this promising field.

SIGHT AND LIFE is a non-profit humanitarian programme founded and funded by
Roche to support the fight against vitamin A deficiency in developing countries. An
estimated 200–300 million children under the age of five are at risk of developing
this condition. Each year half a million young children with vitamin A deficiency go
blind, and the majority of them die of complications within a year. Not only is vita-
min A important for healthy vision, it is also needed for normal growthand plays a
key role in regulating cell division and building resistance to infection.
In 2001 the Task Force SIGHT AND LIFE supported several hundred projects in
Africa, Asia and Latin America. These included technical assistance projects and
support for scientific research. Efforts during the year focused on developing tech-
nical aids and instruction materials for medical and paramedical training pro-

The capsules, which are manufactured especially for SIGHT AND LIFE, areused
primarily in prevention programmes, but are also very useful in treating acute vita-
min A deficiency.
Social Involvement 61Finance
After a slow start Roche has significantly improved the performance
of the underlying operating business in 2001 as a result of a strong sales
growth in Pharmaceuticals and faster than expected cost savings from
the restructuring programme ‘Re-shaping for Future Growth’.Thus the
programme has achieved payback within one year.The operating
profit margin of the underlying Pharmaceuticals business improved by
1.2 percentage points to 19.6% and is now close to the targeted range
of 20–25%.Diagnostics continued to grow at double-digit rates and
improved profitability further.For our treasury operations 2001 was a
difficult year.The decline in world stock markets has led to a reduced
financial result.Once again Roche produced a strong positive cash flow
from operating activities and remains solidly financed.

of Genentech shares in 2000. The underlying 2001 operating results show continued improvement,
with increased sales in Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics and an improved on-going cost struc-
ture. Operating profit on an adjusted basis, which excludes the effects of the special items, has
increased by 11% to 4.8 billion Swiss francs. Adjusted net income is down by 4% to 4.8 billion
Swiss francs, as the improved operating performance is offset by the reduced financial result and
increased tax expenses. To further improve the transparency of the Group’s results, the financial
statements include additional disclosures, with a breakdown of the Pharmaceuticals Division into
Roche prescription, Genentech prescription and OTC, and a more detailed split of financial
income.
Cash flows from operating activities were 5.1 billion Swiss francs, of which 800 million Swiss
francs was used in financing activities to reduce debt, and 3.7 billion Swiss francs reinvested into
marketable securities. Net liquidity has increased by 100 million Swiss francs to 5.3 billion Swiss
francs.
With our liquid funds and the on-going cash flow
generation we will support the strengthening
of Roche as a unique healthcare company on two
high-tech pillars.

64 Financial ReviewResults reported in the Consolidated Financial Statementsin millions of CHF
Operating profit : decrease of 54% due to impact of special items
Operating profit decreased by 54% to 3.2 billion Swiss francs. The 2000 operating result includes
six months of the results of the Fragrances and Flavours Division, and in addition net operating
income of 2.6 billion Swiss francs arising from special items, notably the 3.9 billion Swiss franc
gain on the sale of Genentech shares and a 1.2 billion Swiss franc impairment charge arising
from a change in accounting policy (see table on page 75). Operating profit in 2001 includes net
operating expenses of 1.5 billion for the Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring and the vitamin
case. Excluding these items, operating profit increased by 11% to 4.8 billion Swiss francs, which
isdiscussed below in the commentary on the adjusted results.
Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring: Non-recurring costs of 777 million Swiss francs were
incurred in 2001 due to the implementation of the Pharmaceuticals Division’s ‘Re-shaping for
Future Growth’ programme. As previously indicated the total restructuring costs are estimated
atapproximately 1 billion Swiss francs, of which approximately 35% are non-cash impairment
charges. The programme has already led to significant improvements in the cost structure,
asdescribed below.
Vitamin case: Based on the development of the litigation and recent settlement negotiations,
mainly in the United States, the Group has recorded additional provisions of 760 million Swiss
francs. This amount reflects the terms of the settlements achieved recently in a number of
individual civil cases. As the litigation is in process and as new litigation may arise it is possible
that the final obligation may be different from this.
Net income: decrease of 57% due to impact of special items
The same factors that cause the decrease in operating profit lead to the large decrease in net
income. In addition, financial income in 2000 includes gains of 660 million Swiss francs arising
from the part disposal of an associated company and income taxes includes the tax effects of the
various special items. There was also a one-time gain in 2000 arising from changes in accounting
policies. Excluding these items, net income decreased by 4% to 4.8 billion Swiss francs, which is
discussed below in the commentary on the adjusted results.
Results on an adjusted basisin millions of CHF
Sales: increased sales, with double-digit growth in Diagnostics
Excluding the Fragrances and Flavours Division, which was spun off in mid-2000, adjusted
salesincreased by 6%. Pharmaceuticals sales grew by 6%, with a particularly good performance
from new products such as Mabthera/Rituxan, Herceptin and Xeloda. There were robust sales
from longer-established products such as CellCept. Kytril, which was acquired at the end of 2000,
contributed sales which offset the impacts of the patent expiry on Versed/Dormicum and the
delisting of Draganon in Japan. Diagnostics once again showed strong double-digit sales growth
driven by Molecular Diagnostics and Diabetes Care. The relative fall in sales in Vitamins and
FineChemicals is due to the inclusion of the medicinal feed additives (MFA) products, which
were sold in May 2000, in the comparative figure. Excluding MFA, sales increased due to
increased volume.

francs of sales to the Fragrances and Flavours Division in the first half of 2000, prior to its spin-off.
b) Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division sales in 2000 include sales of medicinal feed additives (MFA) products up to the
date of their disposal in May 2000. Excluding MFA, 2001 Vitamins and Fine Chemicals sales increased by 3% in local
currencies and 1% in CHF.
Operating profit: increase of 11% from on-going operations
Operating profit increased by 11% to 4.8 billion Swiss francs on an adjusted basis, which excludes
Fragrances and Flavours in 2000 and other special items (see table on page 75). The increase was
primarily driven by the sales growth and a significantly improved cost structure as a result of the
‘Re-shaping for Future Growth’ initiative. The operating profit as a percentage of sales improved
by 0.8 percentage points to 16.4%. This result was achieved in spite of the 2000 result including
600 million Swiss francs of gains on continuing product portfolio and asset realignments in
respect of the sale of North American rights to Coreg and the MFA products, which did not
reoccur in 2001.
Gross profit: Increase of 9% to 20.8 billion Swiss francs, with the gross profit margin improved
by2.1 percentage points to 71.4%. This reflects particularly strong growth in high-margin Pharma-
ceuticals products and Diagnostics business areas, productivity improvements in all divisions
andthe effects of the Pharmaceuticals Division’s ‘Re-shaping for Future Growth’ initiative. This
improvement was achieved in spite of continued pressure on prices, in particular for Vitamins and
Fine Chemicals, and a new generation of products in Diagnostics with increased production and
service costs.
Marketing and distribution: Decrease of 1% to 8.5 billion Swiss francs over the full year, after a
rise of 2% in the first half of the year. This is due to the beneficial effects of the ‘Re-shaping for
Future Growth’ initiative allowing a more focused spend on growth areas, whilst increasing sup-
port for the key growth drivers and supporting new product launches in Pharmaceuticals and in
Diagnostics. Marketing and distribution as a percentage of sales fell by 1.9 percentage points.
Research and development: Decrease of 1% to 3.9 billion Swiss francs. Growth of research and
development expenses in Genentech and Diagnostics to support the strong research and devel-
opment pipeline, new strategic alliances, collaborations and in-licensing agreements was offset
by reduced expenditure in Roche prescription. This reflects an even more intensive review of the
development portfolio and the impacts of the ‘Re-shaping for Future Growth’ initiative. Research
and development costs as a percentage of sales on Group level declined from 14% to 13%. For
Pharmaceuticals, which accounts for more than 80% of the Group’s research and development
expenses, theydecreased from 18% to 17%.
Administration: Increase of 1% to 1.2 billion Swiss francs, well below the sales growth as a
result of continuous efficiency improvements and the impacts of the ‘Re-shaping for Future
Growth’ initiative.
66 Financial ReviewAmortisation of intangible assets: Amortisation expenses increased by 8% due to the
additional amortisation following the acquisition of Kytril in December 2000. Roche’s amortisation
charge, currently more than 5% of sales, continues to be significantly higher than the industry
average. This is primarily due to the goodwill arising from growth through acquisitions and by the
accounting treatment of these acquisitions under International Accounting Standards.
Impairment of long-term assets: Excluding impairment entries recorded arising from the
implementation of the ‘Re-shaping for Future Growth’ programme, there were no significant
impairment entries in 2001.
Other operating income (expense), net: A swing of approximately 1.2 billion Swiss francs from
an income in 2000 of 300 million Swiss francs to an expense in 2001 of 900 million Swiss francs.
The major factors in 2001 were increased net royalty expenses, in particular in Diagnostics, and
exchange losses on receivables due to the devaluation of the Turkish, Brazilian and Argentine
currencies. In addition, the 2000 figures include approximately 600 million Swiss francs gains
from the on-going realignments of the product portfolio.
Financial income
As anticipated, net financial income of 1.5 billion Swiss francs is at a similar level as the half-year.
The decline in world markets in 2001 has had a negative impact on the Group’s financial income
for the period. Despite this the Group has generated sufficient financial income to more than
cover the Group’s financial expenses, which consist mainly of interest costs.
Net income from equity investments was 2.3 billion Swiss francs, which includes a 1.2 billion
Swiss franc gain on the sale of LabCorp shares in June. This is a decline compared to 2000
reflecting the more difficult market conditions. Interest expense was 1.4 billion Swiss francs,
which is broadly at the same level as the previous year. Interest expense, particularly amortisation
of debt discount, tends to be less volatile than some of the other elements of net financial
income.
In order to increase the transparency of the Group’s financial result the information about the
composition of net financial income in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements has
been expanded.
Income taxes: increase in effective tax rate
Operating income now makes up a considerably higher proportion of pre-tax income than has
been the case in previous years. This leads to an increase in the Group’s effective tax rate, as
operating income typically occurs in jurisdictions with higher tax rates when compared to finan-
cial income. Furthermore, the financial income includes the gain on the sale of LabCorp shares
which was taxable in the United States. Consequently, although adjusted pre-tax income in 2001
is 5% higher than in 2000, the 2001 tax charge is 44% higher.
Associated companies and minority interests
These currently do not have a significant impact on the Group results. The expense from minority
interest continues to increase, as the overall contribution of Genentech to net income increases.
Income from associated companies consists mainly of the income from LabCorp for the period
prior to June 2001, during which time it was accounted for as an associated company. The
remaining associated companies have a relatively minor effect.
Net income: decrease of 4%
On an adjusted basis net income is 4% lower at 4.8 billion Swiss francs, with the 11% increase in
operating profit being more than off-set by a slightly lower financial income and a proportionately
higher tax charge.

Seepages 74-75 for a full description and reconciliation.
• EBITDA: Earnings before interest and other financial income, tax, depreciation and amortisation, including impairment.
This corresponds to operating profit before depreciation and amortisation, including impairment.
Pharmaceuticals: improved margins
Pharmaceuticals sales in local currencies increased by 8%, with particularly strong sales of
oncology products and CellCept. Pharmaceuticals operating profit grew by 13% to 3.7 billion
Swiss francs due to higher sales, as well as a considerably improved cost structure as a result of
the ‘Re-shaping for Future Growth’ initiative. The EBITDA of the Pharmaceuticals Division also
increased by 13%. The operating profit margin improved by 1.2 percentage points to 19.6% and
the EBITDA margin by 1.8 percentage points to 29.9%.
The ‘Re-shaping for Future Growth’ initiative is progressing faster than expected. The cost savings
in 2001 are estimated in the order of 600 million Swiss francs. The full effect of the measures,
with annual cost savings of approximately 700 million Swiss francs, will be realised from 2002.
Restructuring costs of 777 million Swiss francs have been recognised in the financial statements,
which comprise employee costs of 528 million Swiss francs, impairment charges related to the
closure of certain operations of 187 million Swiss francs, and some other costs. The total restruc-
turing costs are estimated at approximately 1 billion Swiss francs, of which approximately 35% are
non-cash impairment charges. To enhance comparability the restructuring costs have been
excluded from the adjusted results.
68 Financial ReviewTotal prescription: Prescription drug sales (Roche and Genentech) increased by 9% in local
currencies and 7% in Swiss francs to 17 billion Swiss francs. Operating profit was 13% higher and
operating margin improved to 19.9% of sales from 18.7% in 2000.
Roche prescription sales rose by 5% in local currencies and 2% in Swiss francs. Operating
profit was 4% higher. The main positive factors were higher sales and the favourable impacts of
the ‘Re-shaping for Future Growth’ initiative with a considerably improved cost structure. These
more than off-set the additional amortisation following the acquisition of Kytril and the 563 million
Swiss francs gain on the sale of the North American rights to Coreg which is in the comparative.
Genentech prescription sales improved to 2.9 billion Swiss francs, a growth of 38% in Swiss
francs as well asin local currencies. Operating profit reached 71 million Swiss francs. This is
equivalent to 2.5% of sales, after –9.4% in 2000. This turnaround from an operating loss in 2000 is
due to the strongsales growth in spite of higher costs to support this growth. Genentech’s oper-
ating result includes 663 million Swiss francs of amortisation mainly arising from the acquisition
accounting. EBITDA totalled 966 million Swiss francs, or 33.7% of sales, slightly ahead of the 2000
level.
OTC sales rose by 1% in local currencies, with sales in Swiss francs showing a slight decline of
2% to 1.7 billion Swiss francs. This modest sales growth is ahead of the market growth. The oper-
ating profit margin amounted to 17.2% in 2001, up from 15.3% in 2000. This has been achieved
with an aggressive focus on cost control and in spite of the substantially increased foreign
exchange losses on receivables.
Diagnostics: another strong result
The sales development in the Diagnostics Division again significantly outperformed the market
with an overall growth rate of 14% in local currencies. The division is the market leader in
diagnostics and allfive business areas of the division – Applied Science, Molecular Diagnostics,
Centralized Diagnostics, Near Patient Testing and Diabetes Care – grew faster than the market.
Due to the strong sales growth Roche Diagnostics again achieved a double-digit increase in
operating profit of 21% to 993 million Swiss francs. The EBITDA also grew at a double-digit rate
to 1,833 million Swiss francs. The operating profit margin increased by 1.3 percentage points to
14.4%, and the EBITDA margin by 0.4 percentage points to 26.6%.
Vitamins and Fine Chemicals: on-going price pressure
Sales in the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division were stable in local currencies. Excluding the
medicinal feed additives (MFA) products sold in May 2000, sales increased by 3% in local curren-
cies. Vitamins and Fine Chemicals operating profit and EBITDA both dropped by approximately
145 million Swiss francs to 346 and 577 million Swiss francs, respectively. Approximately 30% of
this decrease was due to the inclusion in the 2000 figures of the one-time gain on the sale of the
MFA products and the remaining 70% was due to increased raw material and energy prices and
somewhat lower selling prices.

The result of ‘Other’ consists of the costs of Corporate Headquarters.

Foreign currency translation effects
The movements on balance sheet positions are due to a combination of factors. Movements in
foreign currency exchange rates have an effect on all balance sheet positions, as assets and
liabilities in Group companies that report in foreign currencies, notably the US dollar and euro,
are translated into Swiss francs at the year-end rate. Such effects are to be expected and will
most likely continue to increase, especially as the alliance with Chugai will result in an increasing
part of the Group’s balance sheet having the Japanese yen as a base currency.
Marketable securities and derivatives booked at fair value
Following the implementation of a new International Accounting Standard, the major change in
accounting policy for 2001 relates to the treatment of financial instruments. This has two signifi-
cant impacts for the Group. Firstly, all derivatives are now reported on the balance sheet at fair
value, and gains and losses are included in financial income. Secondly, available-for-sale mar-
ketable securities and investments are now recorded at market value, and any changes in market
value are recorded in equity until realised, at which point they are included in financial income.
Due to the falls in world stock markets, unrealised net losses, net of tax and minority interests,
of1.4 billion Swiss francs are recorded in equity as at 31December 2001. Given the overall level
of the Group’s marketable securities and other investments of 23.8 billion Swiss francs, this
represents net unrealised losses of approximately 6% at the end of the year compared to net
unrealised gains of 2% at the beginning of the year.
Provisions and litigation
In November and December 2001, the European Union announced fines totalling 525 million
euros (778 million Swiss francs) in respect of the vitamin case. Adequate provision for these
amounts was already recorded, and these amounts will be paid in 2002. As discussed above, the
Group has recorded further provisions of 760 million Swiss francs in respect of the vitamin case.
In addition there are other provisions for on-going litigation, most notably with Igen as discussed
in Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amounts recorded are management’s
best estimate, based on currently available information. As litigation is in process and as new liti-
gation may arise it is possible that the final obligation may be different from this. The total amount
of the provisions isnot disclosed as this may prejudice the Group’s position in current litigation.
No off-balance sheet financing
The Group has no off-balance sheet financing. During 2001 the Group’s subsidiary Genentech
entered into a synthetic lease structure for certain of its facilities, as discussed in Note 12 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. This has been reported on-balance sheet as an increase to
property, plant and equipment of 1.1 billion Swiss francs with a corresponding increase in short-
term and long-term debt. The Group’s operating results for 2001 include a full year’s depreciation
charge on these facilities.

The Group continued to show strong cash generation. Pre-tax cash generated from operations
was 6.3 billion Swiss francs, which was mainly driven by a strong EBITDA. On the financing side,
the most significant cash flows were the 1.7 billion Swiss francs proceeds of the ‘LYONs V’ bond
issue in July and the 1.7 billion Swiss franc repayment on maturity of the ‘Bull Spread’ bonds in
May. There was also a general reduction in long-term bank borrowing and the Group paid 1 billion
Swiss francs in dividends in April. The most significant investing cash flow was the 1.4 billion
Swiss franc proceeds from the sale of LabCorp shares in June. Capital expenditure continued at
previous levels and there were no major acquisitions or divestments. Funds not immediately
required were reinvested in the Group’s marketable securities portfolio. The full cash flow state-
ment is given on page 79 and Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Group has revised its definition of net liquidity following recent changes in accounting
policies. Net liquidity, defined as financial assets at market value less debt liabilities, has
increased during the year by 100 million Swiss francs to 5.3 billion Swiss francs. This is due to
thereinvestment of the cash generated, partly off-set by the fall in global stock prices affecting
the market values of marketable securities and own equity instruments. The 1.1 billion Swiss
francs of debt due to the Genentech synthetic leases has been included in both balances.
Financial Review 71Subsequent events
Majority holding in Chugai
On 10 December 2001 Roche and Chugai announced that they will enter into an alliance to create
a leading research-driven Japanese pharmaceutical company. The alliance, which is subject to
the approval of Chugai’s shareholders and the appropriate regulatory authorities, willsee the
merger of Chugai and Roche’s Japanese pharmaceuticals subsidiary, Nippon Roche. The alliance
is expected to be completed in late 2002 and Roche will be the majority shareholder with a 50.1%
interest.
In purely accounting terms, Chugai will be accounted for as a fully consolidated subsidiary of the
Roche Group with a minority interest of 49.9%, in a similar way to which Genentech is currently
reported within Roche. There will be significant effects of the acquisition accounting, including
on-going impacts of amortisation of goodwill and other intangible assets and any fair value
adjustments.
Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division
The Group is reassessing its strategic options for development of the Vitamins and Fine
Chemicals Division, as discussed in Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Until
theannouncement of a detailed formal plan the Group will continue to account for the
Divisionaspart of its continuing operations.
Sale of LabCorp shares
On 21 February 2002 LabCorp filed a registration statement announcing that the Group plans to
offer for sale a further 7 million shares of LabCorp, with an option to sell a further 0.7 million
shares to cover over-allotments. Assuming that a total of 7.7 million shares would be sold,
Roche’s ownership interest in LabCorp would be reduced from approximately 15% to approxi-
mately 4%.
Amortisation of goodwill
Following the implementation of recent changes companies using United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) will no longer be required to amortise goodwill and
instead must carry out a regular impairment review. Roche will continue to amortise goodwill,
asrequired by International Accounting Standards (IAS), with an expected charge in 2002 of
approximately 500 million Swiss francs.

Financial Review 73The adjusted basis
The concept of the adjusted basis: management’s view of the Group’s on-going operations
presented on a consistent and comparable basis
The consolidated results of the Roche Group are significantly influenced by various special items
and also by changes in International Accounting Standards over the years. To improve the visibil-
ity of the underlying business the adjusted results are also presented. These adjusted results,
which are used in the internal management of the business, represent the results of the Group’s
underlying on-going operations. The principles used to compile the adjusted results are applied
on a consistent basis. The major concepts are as follows:
The adjusted results include:
• Gains or losses on continuing product portfolio and asset realignments.
• Sales and income from newly acquired products.
• Impacts on sales and income of patent expiry, withdrawal or disposal of existing products.
• Impairments of long-term assets (other than as part of a major restructuring).
• Costs of normal ongoing restructuring.
• Gains or losses on sales of marketable securities.
The adjusted results exclude:
• Discontinuing operations, such as the sale or spin-off of a whole business.
• One-time costs of major restructuring and fundamental reorganisations.
• Charges for exceptional legal cases.
• Gains or losses arising on disposal of fully consolidated subsidiaries or associated companies.
• Transition effects of changes in accounting policies.
Specific items excluded from the adjusted results in 2001 and 2000
The 2001 adjusted results exclude:
• The non-recurring costs of the Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring.
• Additional charges in respect of the vitamin case.
The 2000 adjusted results exclude:
• The results of the Fragrances and Flavours Division prior to the Givaudan spin-off in June 2000.
• The gain on the sale of Genentech shares and the gain on the sale of LabCorp shares in
October 2000.
• The impact of the fair value adjustment to Genentech inventories arising from the 1999
acquisition.
• The transition effects of the new impairment policy and the credit from changes in accounting
policies.

1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of the Roche Group have been prepared in accordance
with International Accounting Standards. They have been prepared using the historical cost
convention except that as disclosed in the accounting policies below certain items, including
derivatives and available-for-sale investments, are shown at fair value. They were approved
forissue by the Board of Directors on 25 February 2002.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities,
and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. If in the future
such estimates and assumptions, which are based on management’s best judgement at the date
of the financial statements, deviate from the actual circumstances, the original estimates and
assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the year in which the circumstances change.
Consolidation policy
These financial statements are the consolidated financial statements of Roche Holding Ltd,
acompany registered in Switzerland, and its subsidiaries (hereafter ‘the Group’).
The subsidiaries are those companies controlled, directly or indirectly, by Roche Holding Ltd,
where control is defined as the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an enter-
prise so as to obtain benefits from its activities. This control is normally evidenced when Roche
Holding Ltd owns, either directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights of a company’s
share capital. Companies acquired during the year are consolidated from the date on which oper-
ating control is transferred to the Group, and subsidiaries to be divested are included up to the
date of divestment. Companies acquired to be resold are not consolidated but are classified as
assets held for sale and carried at fair value. Assets identified for divestment in the following year
are reclassified as assets held for sale within other current assets. These assets normally consist
mainly of inventories, property, plant and equipment, and other long-term assets.
Investments in associated companies are accounted for by the equity method. These are compa-
nies over which the Group exercises significant influence, but which it does not control. This is
normally evidenced when the Group owns 20% or more of the voting rights of the company. Inter-
ests in joint ventures are reported using the line-by-line proportionate consolidation method.
Foreign currency translation
Most Group companies maintain their financial records in their local currency. Certain Group
companies maintain financial information for Group reporting purposes in US dollars, Swiss
francs or euros where these are the measurement currencies of the companies concerned. Local
transactions in other currencies are initially reported using the exchange rate at the date of the
transaction. Gains and losses from the settlement of such transactions, as well as gains and
losses on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are included in income,
except when they are deferred into equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
80 Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsUpon consolidation assets and liabilities of Group companies using measurement currencies
other than Swiss francs (foreign entities) are translated into Swiss francs using year-end rates of
exchange. Sales, costs, expenses, net income and cash flows are translated at the average rates
of exchange for the year. Translation differences due to the changes in exchange rates between
the beginning and the end of the year and the difference between net income translated at the
average and year-end exchange rates are taken directly to equity. On the divestment of a foreign
entity, the identified cumulative currency translation differences relating to that foreign entity are
recognised in income as part of the gain or loss on divestment.
Revenues and cost of sales
Sales represent amounts received and receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to
customers after deducting volume discounts and sales taxes. Revenues from sale of products are
recognised upon transfer to the customer of significant risks and rewards, usually upon shipment.
Royalty income is recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the economic substance
ofthe agreement. Receipts of up-front and milestone payments and other similar non-refundable
payments relating to the sale or licensing of products or technology are initially reported as
deferred income. They are recognised in income over the period of the development collaboration
or the manufacturing obligation. Other revenues are recorded as earned or as the services are
performed. Cost of sales includes the corresponding direct production costs and related produc-
tion overhead of goods manufactured and services rendered.
Research and development
Research costs are charged against income as incurred, with the exception of buildings and
major items of equipment, which are capitalised and depreciated. Development costs, such as
milestone payments and other similar non-refundable up-front product licence payments, are
capitalised as intangible assets when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the
Group. They are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the expected benefit, and
are reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date. Other development costs are charged
against income as incurred since the criteria for their recognition as an asset are not met.
Employee benefits
Wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and
non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by
employees of the Group. Where the Group provides long-term employee benefits, the cost is
accrued to match the rendering of the services by the employees concerned.
The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans throughout the
world. The cost for the year for defined benefit plans is determined using the projected unit credit
method. This reflects service rendered by employees to the dates of valuation and incorporates
actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of
benefits, projected rates of remuneration growth, and long-term expected rates of return for plan
assets. Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds in the
country concerned. Differences between assumptions and actual experiences, and effects of
changes in actuarial assumptions are allocated over the estimated average remaining working
lives of employees, where these differences exceed a defined corridor. Past service costs are
allocated over the average period until the benefits become vested. Pension assets and liabilities
in different defined benefit schemes are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable
right to use the surplus in one plan to settle obligations in the other plan. Pension assets are only
recognised to the extent that the Group is able to derive future economic benefits in the way of
refunds from the plan or reductions of future contributions.
The Group’s contributions to the defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement
in the year to which they relate.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 81Taxation
Income taxes include all taxes based upon the taxable profits of the Group, including withholding
taxes payable on the distribution of retained earnings within the Group. Other taxes not based
onincome, such as property and capital taxes, are included within operating expenses or financial
expenses according to their nature.
Provision for income taxes, mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of
retained earnings, principally relating to subsidiaries, is only made where there is a current inten-
tion to remit such earnings.
Deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method, under which deferred income
taxes are recognised for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax assets relating to the
carry-forward of unused tax losses are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future tax-
able profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
Current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when the income taxes are levied
by the same taxation authority and when there is a legally enforceable right to offset them.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost of purchase or construction and are
depreciated on a straight-line basis, except for land, which is not depreciated. Estimated useful
lives of major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:
Buildings and land improvements 40 years
Machinery and equipment 5–15 years
Office equipment 3 years
Motor vehicles 5 years
Investment grants or similar assistance for projects are initially recorded as deferred income
(inother non-current liabilities) and are subsequently recognised as income over the useful lives
of the related assets. Repairs and maintenance costs are recognised as expenses as incurred.
Borrowing costs are not capitalised. Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated over
their estimated useful lives. Payments made under operating leases are charged against income
on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Intangible assets and Business combinations
Goodwill is recorded as an intangible asset and is the surplus of the cost of acquisition over the
fair value of identifiable assets acquired. Any goodwill and fair value adjustments are treated
asassets and liabilities of the acquired company and are recorded in the local currency of that
company.
Patents, licences, trademarks and other intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value.
Where these assets have been acquired through a business combination, this will be the fair
value allocated in the acquisition accounting. Where these have been acquired other than
through a business combination, the initial fair value will be cost.
82 Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsAll intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis. Estimated useful
lives of major classes of intangible assets are as follows:
Goodwill 5–20 years
Patents, licences, trademarks Lower of legal duration and
and other intangible assets economic useful life, up to a maximum of 20 years
Impairment of long-term assets
When the recoverable amount of an asset, being the higher of its net selling price and its value
inuse, is less than its carrying amount, then the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable
value. This reduction is reported in the income statement as an impairment loss. Value in use is
calculated using estimated cash flows, generally over a five-year period, with extrapolating pro-
jections for subsequent years. These are discounted using an appropriate long-term pre-tax
interest rate. When an impairment arises the useful life of the asset in question is reviewed and,
ifnecessary, the future depreciation/amortisation charge is accelerated.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined by the first-
in first-out method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash on hand and time, call and current balances with
banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which
are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. This definition is also used for the cash flow
statement.
Own equity instruments
The Group’s holdings in its own equity instruments are recorded as a deduction from equity.
Theoriginal cost of acquisition, consideration received for subsequent resale of these equity
instruments and other movements are reported as changes in equity. These instruments have
been acquired primarily to meet the obligations that may arise in respect of certain of the Group’s
debt instruments.
Debt instruments
Debt instruments are initially reported at cost, which is the proceeds received, net of transaction
costs. Subsequently they are reported at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Tothe extent that debt instruments are hedged under qualifying fair value hedges, the hedged
element is recorded at fair value. Any discount between the net proceeds received and the
principal value due on redemption is amortised over the duration of the debt instrument, and
isrecognised as part of interest expense in the income statement.
On issue of convertible debt instruments, the cost of the liability portion is initially calculated
using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible instrument. The remainder of the
net proceeds is allocated to the equity conversion option, which is reported in equity, and to
deferred income taxes liabilities. The liability element is subsequently reported at amortised cost.
Amortisation of the debt discount and release of the deferred tax liabilities are recognised in the
income statement over the duration of the debt instrument. The value of the equity conversion
option is not changed in future periods.
The limited conversion preferred stock is in substance a financial liability rather than an equity
instrument, and therefore it is classified as long-term debt in the balance sheet and the related
dividend payments are treated as interest expense.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 83Provisions
Provisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred which will
probably lead to an outflow of resources that can be reasonably estimated. Provisions are
recorded for the estimated ultimate liability that is expected to arise, taking into account foreign
currency effects and the time value of money. A contingent liability is recorded where the
existence of the obligation will only be confirmed by future events, or where the amount of the
obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability.
Fair values
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged
between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. It is determined by
reference to quoted market prices adjusted for estimated transaction costs that would be
incurred in an actual transaction, or by the use of established estimation techniques such as
option pricing models and estimated discounted values of cash flows. The fair values at the
balance sheet date are approximately in line with their reported carrying values unless specifi-
cally mentioned in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
International Accounting Standards
Several revised or new standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Committee
and interpretations of the Standing Interpretations Committee became effective from 1 January
2001. The principal item affecting the Group is the Standard on ‘Financial instruments: recogni-
tion and measurement’ and its effects are described below.
Accounting effects. The new Standard was implemented effective 1 January 2001. In accord-
ance with the transition arrangements of the Standard, the comparative financial statements were
not restated. The effects of the implementation on the opening balances are shown in the table
below.

84 Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsFinancial assets. Financial assets, principally investments, including marketable securities, are
classified as either ‘Held-for-trading’, ‘Available-for-sale’, ‘Held-to-maturity’ or ‘Originated by the
Group’. Held-for-trading investments are acquired principally to generate profit from short-term
fluctuations in price. Held-to-maturity investments are securities with a fixed maturity that the
Group has the intent and ability to hold until maturity. Investments originated by the Group are
loans and other long-term financial assets created by the Group or acquired from the issuer
inaprimary market. All other investments are considered as available-for-sale.
All investments are initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs. All purchases and sales
are recognised on the settlement date. Held-for-trading investments are subsequently carried
atfair value, with all changes in fair value recorded as financial income (expense) in the period in
which they arise. Held-to-maturity investments are subsequently carried at amortised cost using
the effective interest rate method. Available-for-sale investments are subsequently carried at fair
value, with all changes in fair value recorded in equity. When the available-for-sale investments
are sold, impaired or otherwise disposed of, the cumulative gains and losses previously recog-
nised in equity are included in financial income (expense) for the current period.
Under the Group’s previous accounting policies, long-term investments were carried at cost, less
any permanent diminution in value, and marketable securities were valued at the lower of cost
and market value.
Derivatives. All derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost, including trans-
action costs. Derivatives are subsequently carried at fair value. Apart from those derivatives
designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments (see below), all changes in fair value are
recorded as financial income (expense) in the period in which they arise.
Under the Group’s previous accounting policies, gains and losses from derivative financial instru-
ments used to hedge potential exchange rate exposures were deferred and then offset against
losses and gains on the specific transactions being hedged. The fee agreed in establishing each
contract was amortised over the duration of the contract. Gains and losses from derivative finan-
cial instruments used to hedge potential interest rate exposures were recognised by adjustments
to interest expense. Gains or losses from derivative financial instruments used for trading pur-
poses were taken to income as they arose.
Hedging. For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types.
Fair value hedges are hedges of particular risks that may change the fair value of a recognised
asset or liability. Cash flow hedges are hedges of particular risks that may change the amount or
timing of future cash flows. Hedges of net investment in a foreign entity are hedges of particular
risks that may change the carrying value of the net assets of a foreign entity.
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions
ondocumentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
If these conditions are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In
this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there
were no hedging relationship. In particular any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes
in fair value included in financial income (expense).
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 85For qualifying fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value and the hedged
item is recorded at its previous carrying value, adjusted for any changes in fair value that are
attributable to the hedged risk. Any changes in the fair values are reported in financial income
(expense).
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. The portion of
any change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity, and any remaining inef-
fective portion is reported in financial income (expense). If the hedging relationship is the hedge
of a firm commitment or highly probable forecasted transaction, the cumulative changes of fair
value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in the initial car-
rying value of the asset or liability at the time it is recognised. For all other qualifying cash flow
hedges, the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded
in equity are included in financial income (expense) at the time when the forecasted transaction
affects net income.
For qualifying hedges of net investment in a foreign entity, the hedging instrument is recorded at
fair value. The portion of any change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity.
Any remaining ineffective portion is recorded in financial income (expense) where the hedging
instrument is a derivative and in equity in other cases. If the entity is disposed of, then the cumu-
lative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are
included in financial income (expense) at the time of the disposal.
Changes effective 1 January 2000
Several revised or new standards and interpretations became effective from 1 January 2000.
Themost significant of these were as follows:
‘Impairment of assets’. Effective 1 January 2000, the Group recognised impairment charges of
1,161 million Swiss francs relating to acquired intangible assets. A reduction in deferred tax liabil-
ities of 348 million Swiss francs was also recorded, giving a net charge of 813 million Swiss francs
in the consolidated results.
‘Intangible assets’ and ‘Business combinations’. Effective 1 January 2000, the Group
recorded certain reclassifications and adjustments of the original purchase accounting allo-
cations to reflect the revised balances, which resulted in a credit to income, net of tax and
minority interests, of 1,395 million Swiss francs.
The above changes are fully described in the 2000 consolidated financial statements.
86 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements2. Financial risk management
Financial risk management within the Group is governed by policies and guidelines approved by
senior management. These policies and guidelines cover foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk,
market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Group policies and guidelines also cover areas such as
cash management, investment of excess funds and the raising of short- and long-term debt.
Group companies report details of the financial instruments outstanding and financial liquidity
toGroup Treasury on at least a monthly basis. During 2001 a new post of Financial Risk Manager
was created to oversee compliance with the Group’s financial risk management policies and
guidelines.
The Group, in accordance with its risk management guidelines, continues to monitor these risks,
and when deemed appropriate, certain of the above risks are significantly altered through the use
of financial instruments, such as derivatives. Group management believes that, in order to create
the optimum value for the Group, it is not desirable to eliminate or mitigate all possible market
fluctuations. In addition, Group management have wide discretion to undertake various contracts,
which could result in significant trading positions that change in value as market prices change.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates across the world and is exposed to movements in foreign currencies affect-
ingits net income and financial position, as expressed in Swiss francs. The Group continues
tomonitor its currency exposures, and when appropriate, enters into transactions with the aim
ofpreserving the value of assets, commitments and anticipated transactions. The Group uses
forward contracts and foreign currency options to optimise certain anticipated foreign exchange
revenues, cash flows and financing transactions.
Transaction exposure arises because the amount of local currency paid or received for trans-
actions denominated in foreign currencies may vary due to changes in exchange rates. For many
Group companies income will be primarily in the local currency. A significant amount of expen-
diture, especially for purchase of goods for resale and interest on and repayment of loans will be
in foreign currencies. Similarly, transaction exposure arises on net balances of monetary assets
held in foreign currencies. Group companies manage this exposure at a local level, if necessary
by means of financial instruments such as options and forward contracts. In addition, Group
Treasury monitors total worldwide exposure with the help of comprehensive data received on
amonthly basis.
Translation exposure arises from the consolidation of the foreign currency denominated finan-
cial statements of the Group’s foreign subsidiaries. The effect on the Group’s consolidated equity
is shown as a currency translation movement. The Group hedges significant net investments in
foreign currencies by taking foreign currency loans or issuing foreign currency denominated debt
instruments. Major translation exposures are monitored on a regular basis.
A significant part of the Group’s cash outflows for research, development, production and admin-
istration is denominated in Swiss francs, while a much smaller proportion of the Group’s cash
inflows are Swiss franc denominated. As a result, an increase in the value of the Swiss franc rela-
tive to other currencies has an adverse impact on consolidated net income. Similarly, a relative
fall in the value of the Swiss franc has a favourable effect on results published in Swiss francs.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 87Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises from movements in interest rates which could have adverse effects on the
Group’s net income or financial position. Changes in interest rates cause variations in interest
income and expenses on interest-bearing assets and liabilities. In addition, they can affect the
market value of certain financial assets, liabilities and instruments as described in the following
section on market risk.
The interest rates on the Group’s major debt instruments are fixed, as described in Note 26,
which reduces the Group’s exposure to changes in interest rates. Group companies manage their
short-term interest rate risk at a local level, if necessary using financial instruments such as
interest rate forward contracts, swaps and options.
Market risk
Changes in the market value of certain financial assets, liabilities and instruments can affect the
net income or financial position of the Group. Long-term investments are held for strategic pur-
poses and marketable securities are held for fund management purposes. The risk of loss in value
is reduced by reviews prior to investing, concentration of investments and continuous monitoring
of the performance of investments and changes in their risk configuration. Investments in equity
and fixed income instruments are entered to on the basis of approved guidelines with regard to
liquidity and credit rating.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counter-party to a transaction may be unable or
unwilling to meet their obligations causing a financial loss to the Group.
Trade receivables are subject to a policy of active risk management focussing on the assessment
of country risk, credit availability, ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures.
There are no significant concentrations within trade receivables of counter-party credit risk, due
to the Group’s large number of customers and their wide geographical spread. Country risk limits
and exposures are continuously monitored.
The exposure of other financial assets to credit risk is controlled by setting a policy for limiting
credit exposure to high-quality counter-parties, on-going reviews of credit ratings, and limiting
individual aggregate credit exposure accordingly.
Liquidity risk
Group companies need to have sufficient availability of cash to meet their obligations. Individual
companies are responsible for their own cash management, including the short-term investment
of cash surpluses and the raising of loans to cover cash deficits, subject to guidance by the
Group and, in certain cases, to approval at Group level.
The Group maintains sufficient reserves of cash and readily realisable marketable securities to
meet its liquidity requirements at all times. In addition, the strong international creditworthiness
of the Group allows it to make efficient use of international capital markets for financing pur-
poses.
88 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements3. Group organisation
An overview of the operating subsidiaries and associated companies is included on pages 136 to
137. In addition to the operating companies, the Group has holding and finance companies.
Chugai
On 10 December 2001, Roche and Chugai announced that they will enter into an alliance to
create a leading research-driven Japanese pharmaceutical company. The alliance will see the
merger of Chugai and the Group’s Japanese pharma subsidiary, Nippon Roche. The transaction
will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The newly merged company,
which will be known as Chugai, will become a fully consolidated subsidiary of the Roche Group
with a 49.9% minority interest. The new company will be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Thetransaction is subject to the approval of Chugai’s shareholders and the appropriate regulatory
authorities, and it is expected that it will be completed in late 2002.
The Group has announced a public tender offer for up to 10% of Chugai’s outstanding share
capital. Under the terms of the alliance, the Group may also subscribe to additional new shares of
the newly merged company such that the Group’s ownership will be 50.1%.
Amira
On 6 November 2001, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Amira Medical, Inc.
(Amira). Amira is a company active in diabetes monitoring based in the United States. Net
consideration paid was 159 million Swiss francs. This has been allocated as follows:
Net assets acquiredin millions of CHF
Goodwill13 3
Intangible assets13 202
Deferred income taxes11 (20)
Provisions28 (18)
Other net assets (liabilities) (8)
Total 159
Following the acquisition, a restructuring programme was announced, which resulted in
restructuring charges of 24 million Swiss francs. These are recorded as part of other operating
income (expense) net (see Note 9). The restructuring programme will be substantially complete
by 30 June 2002.
Transactions in 2000
On 29 March 2000 the Group sold 17.3 million shares of Genentech through a public offering
yielding proceeds of 2,771 million US dollars (4,599 million Swiss francs). The resulting pre-tax
gain after incidental costs was 3,949 million Swiss francs.
On 22 December 2000 the Group acquired the global rights to Kytril for 1,871 million Swiss francs.
On 22 December 2000 the Group sold its exclusive rights to Coreg in the United States and
Canada for 660 million Swiss francs. The gain on the sale was 563 million Swiss francs.

92 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements5. Vitamin case
Following the settlement agreement with the US Department of Justice on 20 May 1999 regarding
pricing practices in the vitamin market and the overall settlement agreement to a class action
suitbrought by the US buyers of bulk vitamins, the Group recorded provisions in respect of the
vitamin case in 1999. These provisions were the Group’s best estimate at that time of the total
liability that may arise, taking into account currency movements and the time value of money.
Provisions for legal fees were recorded separately.
In November and December 2001, the European Union announced fines totalling 525 million euros
(778 million Swiss francs) in respect of the vitamin case. Appropriate provision for these amounts
had already been recorded.
At 31 December 2001 the Group reassessed the adequacy of its remaining provisions for the
vitamin case. Based on the development of the litigation and recent settlement negotiations,
mainly inthe United States with direct customers who had previously opted out of the settlement,
the Group has recorded additional provisions of 760 million Swiss francs. This amount reflects the
terms of the settlements achieved recently in a number of individual civil cases. The total amount
of the provisions is the liability that the Group expects to pay, adjusted for foreign currency
translation effects and the time value of money. This assessment is based on currently available
information. As litigation is in process and as new litigation may arise it is possible that the final
obligation may be different from this. The total amount of the provisions is not disclosed as this
may prejudice the Group’s position in current litigation.
Net cash outflows in 2001 were 330 million Swiss francs (2000: net cash inflow of 41 million Swiss
francs).
6. Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring
On 30 May 2001 the Group announced the ‘Re-shaping for Future Growth’ initiative, a major restruc-
turing of its Pharmaceuticals Division, with the objective of improving the long-term profitability
of the division by increasing sales and improving the division’s cost structure. The Group
announced approximately 3,000 job reductions over the following two to three years in conjunc-
tion with the closure or reorganisation of certain facilities, principally in the US, UK and Switzer-
land. Restructuring costs of 777 million Swiss francs have been charged in 2001. These consist of
employee costs of 543 million Swiss francs, impairment charges of 187 million Swiss francs
related to the closure of certain operations, other closure costs of 62 million Swiss francs, and are
netof a gain on curtailment of post-employment defined benefit plans of 15 million Swiss francs
(see Note 8).
Of the employee and closure costs, 239 million Swiss francs were paid by 31 December 2001,
andthe remaining 366 million Swiss francs were included as liabilities in the balance sheet as
at31 December 2001.
7. Givaudan spin-off in millions of CHF
On 8 June 2000 the Group’s Fragrances and Flavours Division was spun off as an independent
company under the name of Givaudan. The shares in Givaudan were distributed on this date as a
special dividend to the holders of Roche shares and non-voting equity securities. As a result of
the spin-off, assets totalling 3.9 billion Swiss francs and liabilities totalling 1.2 billion Swiss francs
were transferred to Givaudan.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 93The results and cash flows of the Fragrances and Flavours Division up until the spin-off in
June2000 are included in the consolidated figures for 2000. However, the consolidated balance
sheet for 2000 is shown after the spin-off and does not include this Division’s assets and
liabilities.

The charges for employee benefits are included in the relevant expenditure line by function. The
number of employees at the year-end was 63,717 (2000: 64,758). Other employee benefits consist
mainly of life insurance schemes and certain other insurance schemes providing medical and
dental cover.
Post-employment benefits
Most employees are covered by retirement benefit plans sponsored by Group companies. The
nature of such plans varies according to legal regulations, fiscal requirements and economic con-
ditions of the countries in which the employees are employed. Other post-employment benefits
consist mostly of post-retirement healthcare and life insurance schemes, principally in the United
States. Plans are usually funded by payments from the Group and by employees to trusts inde-
pendent ofthe Group’s finances. Where a plan is unfunded, a liability for the whole obligation is
recorded in the Group’s balance sheet.
The amounts recognised in arriving at operating profit for post-employment defined benefit plans
are as follows:
2001 2000
Current service cost 362 333
Interest cost 685 675

Gains on curtailment of 15 million Swiss francs relate to the ‘Re-shaping for Future Growth’
programme and have been included as part of ‘Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring – other
restructuring costs’ in the income statement (see Note 6).
The actual return on plan assets was a negative return of 1,334 million Swiss francs (2000: posi-
tive return of 1,175 million Swiss francs).

Therelated net liability recognised is 257 million Swiss francs (2000: 147 million Swiss francs).
Actuarial gains of 50 million Swiss francs (2000: 106 million Swiss francs) were unrecognised.
Amounts recognised in the balance sheet for post-employment defined benefit plans are predom-
inantly non-current and are reported as long-term assets and non-current liabilities.
Included within the fair value of the assets of the funded plans are 650,000 (2000: 900,000) of the
Group’s non-voting equity securities with a fair value of 77 million Swiss francs (2000: 149 million
Swiss francs).
96 Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsThe Group operates defined benefit schemes in many countries and the actuarial assumptions
vary based upon local economic and social conditions. The range of assumptions used in
theactuarial valuations of the most significant defined benefit plans, which are in countries
withstable currencies and interest rates, is as follows:
Discount rates 3 to 8% (2000: 3 to 8%)
Projected rates of remuneration growth 2 to 9% (2000: 2 to 9%)
Expected rates of return on plan assets 3 to 10% (2000: 3 to 10%)
Healthcare cost trend rate 5 to 10% (2000: 4 to 10%)
The Group’s Japanese subsidiaries participate in the Tokyo Pharmaceutical Welfare Fund, a multi-
employer plan which by its nature is a defined benefit plan. This is accounted for as a defined
contribution plan in these financial statements as the Group does not have access to sufficient
information about the plan to account for it as a defined benefit plan. Contributions in 2001
were6 million Swiss francs (2000: 6 million Swiss francs).
Some employees of certain US subsidiaries of the Group receive Stock Appreciation Rights
(SARs) as part of their compensation. The SARs may be exercised after a vesting period of two to
three years for a cash payment, based upon the amount that the market price of the Group’s
American Depositary Shares (ADSs) at the point of exercise exceeds the strike price (grant price
at issuance). The Group accrues for the expected cash outflow from the outstanding SARs. As at
31December 2001 no accrual was required.
The Group operates an option compensation plan for certain employees. The Group purchases
options in Roche non-voting equity securities from financial institutions, which are granted to
certain employees. The costs of the options are deferred as deduction of equity when purchased,
and are expensed when granted to employees. The obligation to deliver the non-voting equity
securities rests with the financial institutions.

11. Income taxes in millions of CHF
Income tax expenses
The amounts charged in the income statement are as follows:
2001 2000
Current income taxes 1,335 2,913
Deferred income taxes (297) (641)
Total charge for income taxes 1,038 2,272
The Group’s parent company, Roche Holding Ltd, and several of the Group’s operating companies
are domiciled in Switzerland. The maximum effective rate of all income taxes on companies
domiciled in Basel, Switzerland, is 8% for holding companies and 25% for operating companies
(2000: 8% and 25%).
Since the Group operates across the world, it is subject to income taxes in many different tax
jurisdictions. The Group calculates its average expected tax rate as a weighted average of the tax
rates in the tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
This rate increased during 2001 as operating income now makes up a considerably higher pro-
portion of pre-tax income than has been the case in previous years. This leads to an increase in
the Group’s effective tax rate, as operating income typically occurs in jurisdictions with higher tax
rates when compared to financial income.
98 Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsThe Group’s effective tax rate differs from the Group’s expected tax rate as follows:
2001 2000

Income tax assets and liabilities
Amounts recognised in the balance sheet for income taxes are as follows:
2001 2000
Current income taxes
Current income tax assets 244 435
Current income tax liabilities (716) (882)
Net current income tax asset (liability) in the balance sheet (472) (447)

Deferred income tax assets 1,410 460
Deferred income tax liabilities (4,162) (2,535)
Net deferred income tax asset (liability) in the balance sheet (2,752) (2,075)
Amounts recognised in the balance sheet for deferred taxes are reported as long-term assets and
non-current liabilities, of which approximately 40% and 15% respectively is current.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry forwards only to the extent that
realisation of the related tax benefit is probable. The Group has no significant unrecognised tax
losses. Deferred income tax liabilities have not been established for the withholding tax and
othertaxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries,
assuch amounts are currently regarded as permanently reinvested. These unremitted earnings
totalled 27.1 billion Swiss francs at 31 December 2001 (2000: 24.8 billion Swiss francs).
The deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the deferred income tax charges (credits) are
attributable to the following items:

The Group’s subsidiary Genentech has synthetic leases on certain of its facilities in California.
InNovember 2001 Genentech entered into a transaction to refinance its largest synthetic lease
through a special purpose entity structure, which under the Group’s accounting policy should
beconsolidated. Accordingly the property, plant and equipment at this site (with a net book value
of714 million Swiss francs) is now recorded on the Group’s balance sheet and an additional
714million Swiss francs is recorded as short-term debt. In addition, the Group considers it appro-
priate to record the remaining Genentech synthetic leases as finance leases, and accordingly
hasrecorded an additional 399million Swiss francs of property, plant and equipment and the
same amount as a long-term finance lease payable.
These reclassifications were recorded effective 1 January 2001 and the Group’s operating income
in 2001 includes a full year’s depreciation charge on these facilities. The effect of the reclassifica-
tion is to reduce net income in 2001 by 21 million Swiss francs. The equivalent amount for 2000
would have been 13 million Swiss francs.
100 Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsExcluding the Genentech synthetic leases, at 31 December 2001 the capitalised cost of machinery
and equipment under finance leases amounts to 581 million Swiss francs (2000: 356 million
Swissfrancs) and the net book value of these assets amounts to 221 million Swiss francs (2000:
250 million Swiss francs).
Operating lease commitments
At 31 December the future minimum annual payments under non-cancellable operating leases
were as follows:
2001 2000
Within one year 100 191
Between one and five years 140 437
Thereafter 12 39
Total minimum annual payments 252 667
Total rental expense in 2001 for all operating leases was 299 million Swiss francs (2000: 322 mil-
lion Swiss francs).
The Group has capital commitments for the purchase or construction of property, plant and
equipment totalling 1.8 billion Swiss francs.

On 1 January 2000 the Group recognised an impairment charge of 1,161 million Swiss francs
when implementing a change in accounting policy (see Note 1). In 2001 a charge of 10 million
Swiss francs (2000: a credit of 14 million Swiss francs) is recognised, based on changes in the
recoverable amounts of impaired assets during the year.

Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings
On 6 June 2001 the Group sold 6,000,000 shares of LabCorp, resulting in a pre-tax gain after
incidental costs of 1,160 million Swiss francs which was recorded as part of financial income
(expense), net. The net pre-tax cash inflow was 1,420 million Swiss francs. As of the date of this
sale the Group’s remaining investment in LabCorp is accounted for as available-for-sale mar-
ketable securities.
On 6 June 2000 LabCorp announced that it had called for the redemption on 7 July 2000 of all of
its outstanding convertible preferred stock. During this redemption period, the Group sold suffi-
cient of its holding in LabCorp’s ordinary stock such that the Group’s non-controlling interest in
LabCorp would be at a similar level after the redemption date as it was before. The Group realised
a pre-tax gain of 296 million Swiss francs during this process. On 17 October 2000 the Group sold
4,000,000 shares of LabCorp, resulting in a pre-tax gain after incidental costs of 660 million Swiss
francs. The above transactions resulted in a net pre-tax cash inflow of 1,123 million Swiss francs.
Basilea Pharmaceutica
On 17 October 2000 the Group contributed cash of 206 million Swiss francs to establish a newly
formed Swiss company, Basilea Pharmaceutica Ltd (Basilea). The Group also transferred certain
know-how and intellectual property in antibiotics, antifungals and dermatology, and property,
plant and equipment to Basilea for a consideration of 6 million Swiss francs. On 31 October 2000
the Group sold 51% of the shares of Basilea. The Group retains a non-controlling interest in
Basilea.

22. Equity
Share capital
At the Annual General Meeting on 3 April 2001, the shareholders approved a 100 for 1 stock split
of the shares and non-voting equity securities of Roche Holding Ltd. The split took place on
4May 2001. The number of shares and non-voting equity securities in issue is now 160,000,000
and 702,562,700, respectively. The nominal value of the shares is now 1 Swiss franc. The non-voting
equity securities have no nominal value. All comparative per share information has been restated
for the split.
Based on information supplied to Roche by a shareholders’ group with pooled voting rights,
comprising Dr L. Hoffmann, Ms V. Michalski-Hoffmann, Ms M.-A. Hoffmann, Mr A. Hoffmann,
MsV. Oeri-Hoffmann, Dr A. Oeri, Ms S. Duschmalé-Oeri, Ms C. Oeri, Ms B. Oeri, Ms M. Oeri and
Dr F. Gerber, that group holds 80,020,000 shares (after the above share split) as in the preceding
year. This figure does not include any shares without pooled voting rights that are held outside
this group by individual members of the group. There were no transactions with these individuals
other than those in the ordinary course of business.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 105Non-voting equity securities (Genussscheine)
As of 31 December 2001, 702,562,700 non-voting equity securities had been issued. Under Swiss
company law these non-voting equity securities have no nominal value, are not part of the share
capital and cannot be issued against a contribution which would be shown as an asset in the
balance sheet of Roche Holding Ltd. Each non-voting equity security confers the same rights as
any of the shares to participate in the net profit and any remaining proceeds from liquidation
following repayment of the nominal value of the shares and, if any, participation certificates. In
accordance with the law and the Articles of Incorporation of Roche Holding Ltd, the company
isentitled at all times to exchange all or some of the non-voting equity securities into shares or
participation certificates.
Dividends
On 3 April 2001 the shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of 1.15 Swiss francs per
share and non-voting equity security (2000: 1.00 Swiss franc) in respect of the 2000 business
year. The distribution to holders of outstanding shares and non-voting equity securities totalled
981 million Swiss francs and has been recorded against retained earnings in 2001. In 2000 the
shareholders also approved the special dividend in respect of the Givaudan spin-off. The account-
ing effect of this distribution, which primarily includes the carrying value in the Group’s financial
statements of the assets and liabilities of Givaudan, totalled 2,642 million Swiss francs and has
been included with the special dividend as a movement in retained earnings in 2000.
Own equity instruments
At 31 December 2001 the number of non-voting equity securities held was 23,669,345 (2000:
28,456,600). The net cash inflow from transactions in own equity instruments was 706 million
Swiss francs (2000: net cash outflow of 875 million Swiss francs).
The Group holds its own equity instruments primarily to meet the obligations that may arise in
respect of certain of the Group’s debt instruments. This may be achieved by holding physical
non-voting equity securities or by holding derivative instruments such as forward contracts or call
options. At 31 December 2001 the Group held derivative instruments equivalent to 19,498,489
(2000: 20,099,700) non-voting equity securities. If all of these instruments were exercised then a
total of 43,167,834 (2000: 48,556,300) non-voting equity securities would be available to the
Group.
The reduction in the number of non-voting equity securities physically held by the Group has
increased the total number of shares outstanding figure used in the earnings per share calcula-
tions, and the impact of this is to reduce earnings per share by 1% in 2001.

The fair value of long-term debt is 17.5 billion Swiss francs (2000: 20.8 billion Swiss francs). This
iscalculated based upon the present value of the future cash flows on the instrument, discounted
at a market rate of interest for instruments with similar credit status, cash flows and maturity
periods.
Amounts due to banks and other financial institutions
Interest rates on these amounts, which are primarily denominated in US dollars and euros,
average approximately 3.7% (2000: 5%). Repayment dates vary between 1 and 15 years.

27. Derivative financial instruments in millions of CHF
In appropriate circumstances the Group uses derivative financial instruments as part of its risk
management and trading strategies. This is discussed in Note 2.
Following a change in accounting policy, derivative financial instruments in 2001 are carried at
fair value. This change in accounting policy and the methods used for determining fair value are
described in Note 1. The fair value of derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2000
was 271 million Swiss francs, which was 65 million Swiss francs more than the reported carrying
value.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 111Hedge accounting
Following the implementation of the new International Accounting Standard on ‘Financial
instruments: recognition and measurement’ the Group has changed its policy on hedge account-
ing effective from 1 January 2001. The new policy, which is described in Note 1, requires that
toqualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on
documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
As described in Note 2, the Group has financial risk management policies, which cover foreign
exchange risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. When deemed appropri-
ate, certain of the above risks are altered through the use of derivatives. While many of these
transactions can be considered as hedges in economic terms, if the required conditions are not
met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting. In this case the hedging instru-
ment and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship,
which means that any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in
financial income (expense).
Due to the considerable administrative cost of maintaining the necessary documentation and
tracking procedures, the Group generally limits the use of hedge accounting for certain signifi-
cant transactions. Consequently as at 31 December 2001 the Group has no fair value hedges,
cash flow hedges or hedges of net investment in a foreign entity that meet the strict requirements
to qualify for hedge accounting, apart from those described below.
Fair value hedges: The Group has equity investments in various biotechnology companies that are
subject to a greater risk of market fluctuation than the stock market in general. To manage part of
this exposure the Group enters into derivative financial instruments such as zero cost collars and
forward contracts. Any changes in the fair values are reported in financial income (expense).
Cash flow hedges: The Group has expected foreign currency cash flows from future royalty
income and development expenses. To hedge part of this transaction exposure the Group enters
into derivative financial instruments such as options and forward contracts. The Group also has
anticipated cash flows from its interest-bearing investments, which are exposed to changes in
interest rates. To manage part of this risk the Group enters into interest rate swap agreements,
which effectively convert part of the expected interest income from variable to fixed rate. Move-
ments on the fair value reserve for designated cash flow hedges are disclosed in Note 24.

Total provisions 596 3,371 3,967 3,995
Restructuring provisions arise from planned programmes that materially change the scope of
business undertaken by the Group or the manner in which business is conducted. Such provi-
sions include only the costs necessarily entailed by the restructuring which are not associated
with the on-going activities of the Group. The creation of such provisions is recorded as a charge
against other operating income, except where they arise from the restructuring of newly
acquiredcompanies, in which case they are included in the acquisition accounting and hence
form part of the goodwill. See also Note 6 regarding the Pharmaceuticals Division restructuring.
Other provisions consist mainly of legal, environmental and similar matters. Other provisions
include provisions in respect of the vitamin case (see Note 5).
29. Contingent liabilities
The operations and earnings of the Group continue, from time to time and in varying degrees, to
be affected by political, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, including those relating to
environmental protection, in the countries in which it operates. The industries in which the Group
is engaged are also subject to physical risks of various kinds. The nature and frequency of these
developments and events, not all of which are covered by insurance, as well as their effect on
future operations and earnings are not predictable.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 113Vitamin case
Provisions have been recorded in respect of the vitamin case, as disclosed in Note 5. These provi-
sions are the Group’s best current estimate of the total liability that may arise. This assessment is
based on currently available information. As litigation is in process and as new litigation may
arise it is possible that the final obligation may be different from this.
Igen litigation
On 15 February 2002 the United States District Court of Maryland entered judgement in the civil
litigation between Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany, (RDG) and Igen International, Inc. (Igen)
over claims related to the licensing of Igen’s electrochemiluminescence (ECL) to RDG. The court
concluded that several breaches of the licence agreement were material so that Igen has the right
to terminate the licence agreement, and awarded Igen 105.4 million US dollars in compensatory
damages and 400 million US dollars in punitive damages. RDG will file an appeal against the
decision. An existing order of the court bars any licence termination until all appeal proceedings
are completed. While any appeal is in progress, RDG will continue to provide its customers with
the products and services and will continue all planned innovations based on the ECL technology.
RDG and previously Boehringer Mannheim have been in litigation since 1997 over these matters.
When acquiring Boehringer Mannheim, RDG assessed the Igen litigation and the adequacy of the
provision already recorded by Boehringer Mannheim. RDG has reassessed the adequacy of these
provisions and has concluded that, based on currently available information, it is not appropriate
to record additional provisions at this point. The total amount of the provisions is the liability
thatRDG expects to pay, adjusted for foreign currency translation effects and the time value of
money. As litigation is in process it is possible that the final obligation may be different from this.
The total amount of the provisions is not disclosed as this may prejudice the RDG position in
current litigation, however the provisions are significantly less than the amounts awarded by the
court.
30. Cash flow statementin millions of CHF
Cash flows from operating activities
Cash flows from operating activities are those derived from the Group’s primary activities,
asdescribed in the divisional review. This is calculated by the indirect method, by adjusting the
Group’s operating profit for any operating income and expenses that are not cash flows (for
example depreciation, amortisation and impairment) in order to derive the cash generated from
operations. This and other operating cash flows are shown in the cash flow statement. Operating
cash flows also include income taxes paid on all activities, including, for example, the taxes paid
on the gains on Genentech and LabCorp share sales.

Cash flows from financing activities are primarily the proceeds from issue and repayments of the
Group’s equity and debt instruments. They also include interest payments and dividend payments
on these instruments. Cash flows from short-term financing, including finance leases, are also
included. These cash flows indicate the Group’s transactions with the providers of its equity and
debt financing.
Cash flows from short-term borrowings are shown as a net movement, as these consist of a large
number of transactions with short maturity.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 115Cash flows from investing activities
Cash flows from investing activities are principally those arising from the Group’s investments
inproperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and from the acquisition and divestment
of subsidiaries, associated companies and businesses. Cash flows connected with the Group’s
portfolio of marketable securities and other investments are also included as are any interest and
dividend payments received in respect of these securities and investments. These cash flows
indicate the Group’s net reinvestment in its operating assets and the cash flow effects of the
changes in Group organisation, as well as the cash generated by the Group’s other investments.
Cash flows from marketable securities, including income and capital gains and losses, are shown
as a net movement on the Group’s portfolio, as these consist of a large number of positions which
are not held on a long-term basis.

Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division
Management has begun the evaluation of the strategic options with respect to the Vitamins
andFine Chemicals Division. As of the date of approval of these financial statements the Board of
Directors has not approved a detailed formal plan and no announcement of its intentions has
been made.Accordingly, the Vitamins and Fine Chemicals Division remains classified as part of
the continuingoperations of these financial statements.
Sale of LabCorp shares
On 21 February 2002 LabCorp filed a registration statement announcing that the Group plans to
offer for sale a further 7 million shares of LabCorp, with an option to sell a further 0.7 million
shares to cover over-allotments. Assuming that a total of 7.7 million shares would be sold,
Roche’s ownership interest in LabCorp would be reduced from approximately 15% to approxi-
mately 4%.
116 Notes to the Consolidated Financial StatementsReport of the Group Auditors
To the General Meeting of Roche Holding Ltd, Basel
As auditors of the Group, we have audited the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Roche

fession and with the International Standards on Auditing issued by the International Federation
of Accountants, which require that an audit be planned and performed to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements are free from material misstate-
ment. We have examined on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
theConsolidated Financial Statements. We have also assessed the accounting principles used,
significant estimates made and the overall consolidated financial statement presentation.
Webelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Roche Group present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position at 31 December 2001, and the results of operations and
the cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Accounting Standards,
and comply with Swiss law.

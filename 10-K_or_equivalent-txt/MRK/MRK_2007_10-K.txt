Merck&Co.,Inc.(“Merck”orthe“Company”)isaglobalresearch-drivenpharmaceuticalcompanythat
discovers,develops,manufacturesandmarketsabroadrangeofinnovativeproductstoimprovehumanandanimal
health.TheCompany’soperationsareprincipallymanagedonaproductsbasisandarecomprisedoftworeportable
segments: the Pharmaceutical segment and the Vaccines segment. The Pharmaceutical segment includes human
health pharmaceutical products marketed either directly or through joint ventures. These products consist of
therapeutic and preventive agents, sold by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders. Merck sells these
humanhealthpharmaceuticalproductsprimarilytodrugwholesalersandretailers,hospitals,governmentagencies
andmanagedhealthcareproviderssuchashealthmaintenanceorganizations,pharmacybenefitmanagersandother
institutions.TheVaccinessegmentincludeshumanhealthvaccineproductsmarketedeitherdirectlyorthrougha

istered at physician offices. Merck sells these human health vaccines primarily to physicians, wholesalers,
physician distributors and government entities. The Company’s professional representatives communicate the

For financial information and other information about the Pharmaceutical segment and the Vaccines
segment,seeItem7.“Management’sDiscussionandAnalysisofFinancialConditionandResultsofOperations”
and Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.
Overview—During2007,Merckbeganrealizingbenefitsfromitsmulti-yearstrategicplandesignedto
reengineer the way the Company develops and distributes medicines and vaccines worldwide. The Company is
benefiting from the evolution of a new commercial model designed to align the Company’s product research,
developmentandmarketingeffortsutilizingthelatesttechnologiesandbroadeningitsengagementwithcustomers,
physicians and scientific leaders to get needed medicines and vaccines through the development pipeline and to
patients sooner. The Company is also working to build a sustainable research and development advantage by
leveraging technologies to facilitate drug discovery and development and has successfully reduced clinical
development cycle-time.
TheprogressoftheseeffortsisdemonstratedinpartbytheCompany’srevenuegrowthin2007,which
reflected the continued market penetration and global rollout of Gardasil [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent
(Types6,11,16and18)Vaccine,Recombinant],avaccinetohelppreventcervicalcancer,pre-cancerousandlow-

vaccine to help prevent rotavirus gastroenteritis in infants and children, coupled with the strong performance of
severalin-lineproducts.Thegrowthintheseproductshasmorethanoffset2007revenuedeclinesassociatedwith
the 2006 loss of U.S. market exclusivity for Zocor and Proscar.
Additionally,theCompanycontinued theadvancement ofdrugcandidates throughitspipeline. During
2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approved both Janumet (sitagliptin phosphate and
metforminhydrochloride),anoralantihyperglycemicagentthatcombinesJanuviawithmetformininasingletablet
toaddressallthreekeydefectsoftype2diabetes,andIsentress(raltegravir),afirst-in-classintegraseinhibitorfor
the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-experienced patients. In addition, on January 25, 2008, the FDA
approvedEmend(fosaprepitant dimeglumine)forInjection, anintravenoustherapy forthe preventionofchemo-
therapy-inducednauseaandvomiting(“CINV”).Also,theCompanyanticipatestheFDAwilltakeactionin2008on

treatment of obesity. The Company’s research and development efforts are more fully discussed in “Research
and Development” below.
Aspartofimplementingthenewcommercialmodel,theCompanyisreengineeringitscorebusinesstobe
more efficient with the goal of reducing aspects of its cost base and realizing gross margin improvement. The
reengineering includes the implementation of manufacturing and marketing cost savings initiatives. The initial
phaseoftheglobalrestructuringprogramannouncedin2005wasdesignedtoreducetheCompany’scoststructure,

and two preclinical sites and eliminated approximately 7,200 positions company-wide (comprised of actual
headcountreductionsandtheeliminationofcontractorsandvacantpositions).TheCompany,however,continuesto
hirenewemployeesasthebusinessrequires.Thepretaxcostsofthisrestructuringprogramsinceinceptionthrough
the end of 2007 were $2.1 billion, of which approximately 70% are non-cash, relating primarily to accelerated
depreciation for those facilities scheduled for closure and approximately 30% represent separation and other
restructuring related costs. These costs were $810.1 million in 2007 and are expected to be approximately
$100million to$300million in2008,atwhichtimetheinitial phaseoftherestructuring programrelating tothe

cost reduction program, combined with cost savings the Company expects to achieve in its marketing and
administrativeandresearchanddevelopmentexpenses,willyieldcumulativepretaxsavingsof$4.5to$5.0billion
from 2006 through 2010.
OnNovember9,2007,Merckenteredintoanagreement(the“SettlementAgreement”)withthelawfirms
that comprise the executive committee of the Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee of the federal multidistrict Vioxx
litigation as well as representatives of plaintiffs’ counsel in state coordinated proceedings to resolve state and
federal myocardial infarction (“MI”)andischemic stroke(“IS”)claims alreadyfiledagainsttheCompanyinthe

TheCompanyandSchering-PloughsellVytorinandZetiathroughtheirjointventurecompany,Merck/

American College of Cardiology meeting in March 2008 and was notified of its acceptance by the College.
ENHANCE was a surrogate endpoint trial conducted in 720 patients with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholes-
terolemia, a rare condition that affects approximately 0.2% of the population. All analyses were conducted in
accordance with the original statistical analysis plan. The primary endpoint was the mean change in the intima-

cular outcomes trial comparing Vytorin (ezetimibe/simvastatin) and simvastatin and including more than
10,000 patients. Vytorin contains two medicines: ezetimibe and simvastatin. Vytorin has not been shown to
reduce heart attacks or strokes more than simvastatin alone.
During December 2007 and through February 26, 2008, the Company and its joint-venture partner,
Schering-Plough,receivedseveraljointlettersfromtheHouseCommitteeonEnergyandCommerceandtheHouse
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, and one letter from the Senate Finance Committee, collectively
seeking a combination of witness interviews, documents and information on a variety of issues related to the
ENHANCE clinical trial, the sale and promotion of Vytorin, as well as sales of stock by corporate officers. On

In 1982, the Company entered into an agreement with Astra AB (“Astra”) to develop and market Astra

partnership named Astra Pharmaceuticals, L.P. (the “Partnership”), in which the Company maintains a limited
partner interest. The Partnership, renamed AstraZeneca LP, became the exclusive distributor of the products for
which KBI retained rights. The Company earns certain Partnership returns as well as ongoing revenue based on
sales of current and future KBI products. The Partnership returns include a priority return provided for in the

with the 1998 restructuring, for a payment of $443.0 million, Astra purchased an option to buy the Company’s
interest in the KBI products, excluding the Company’s interest in the gastrointestinal medicines Nexium and
Prilosec.TheCompanyalsograntedAstraanoption(the“SharesOption”)tobuytheCompany’scommonstock

In April 1999, Astra merged with Zeneca Group Plc, forming AstraZeneca AB (“AstraZeneca”). As a
result of the merger, in exchange for the Company’s relinquishment of rights to future Astra products with no

In 1989, the Company formed a joint venturewith Johnson& Johnsonto develop and market a broad
range of nonprescription medicines for U.S. consumers. This 50% owned joint venture also includes Canada.
7Significant joint venture products are Pepcid AC (famotidine), an over-the-counter form of the Company’sulcer
medication Pepcid (famotidine), as well as Pepcid Complete, an over-the-counter product which combines the
Company’s ulcer medication with antacids (calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide).

Competition—The markets in which the Company conducts its business are highly competitive and
often highly regulated. Global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product
pricing and access.
Such competition involves an intensive search for technological innovations and the ability to market
theseinnovationseffectively.Withitslong-standingemphasisonresearchanddevelopment,theCompanyiswell
preparedtocompeteinthesearchfortechnologicalinnovations.Additionalresourcestomeetcompetitioninclude
qualitycontrol,flexibilitytomeetcustomerspecifications,anefficientdistributionsystemandastrongtechnical
informationservice.TheCompanyisactiveinacquiringandmarketingproductsthroughjointventuresandlicenses
andhasbeenrefiningitssalesandmarketingeffortstofurtheraddresschangingindustryconditions.Toenhanceits
product portfolio, the Company continues to pursue external alliances, from early-stage to late-stage product
opportunities, including joint ventures and targeted acquisitions. However, the introduction of newproducts and
processesbycompetitorsmayresultinpricereductionsandproductreplacements,evenforproductsprotectedby
patents. For example, the number ofcompounds available totreat diseasestypically increases over time and has
resulted in slowing the growth in sales of certain of the Company’s products.
Legislation enacted in all states in the United States, particularly in the area of human pharmaceutical
products, allows, encourages or, in a few instances, in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing
physician, mandates the use of “generic” products (those containing the same active chemical as an innovator’s
product)ratherthan“brand-name” products.Governmental andotherpressurestowardthedispensingofgeneric

Distribution—TheCompanysellsitshumanhealthpharmaceutical productsprimarily todrugwhole-
salersandretailers,hospitals,governmentagenciesandmanagedhealthcareproviderssuchashealthmaintenance
organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. Human health vaccines are sold primarily to
physicians, wholesalers, physician distributors and government entities. The Company’s professional represen-
tativescommunicatetheeffectiveness,safetyandvalueoftheCompany’spharmaceuticalandvaccineproductsto
health care professionals in private practice, group practices and managed care organizations.
8RawMaterials—Rawmaterialsandsupplies,whicharegenerallyavailablefrommultiplesources,are
purchased worldwide and are normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of the Company’s
Pharmaceutical and Vaccines segments.
GovernmentRegulationandInvestigation—Thepharmaceuticalindustryissubjecttoglobalregulation
by regional, country, state and local agencies. Of particular importance is the FDA in the United States, which
administers requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and mar-
keting ofprescriptionpharmaceuticals. Inmanycases,theFDArequirements haveincreased theamountoftime
andmoneynecessarytodevelopnewproductsandbringthemtomarketintheUnitedStates.In1997,theFoodand
DrugAdministrationModernizationAct(the“FDAModernizationAct”)waspassedandwastheculminationofa
comprehensive legislative reform effort designed to streamline regulatory procedures within the FDA and to
improvetheregulationofdrugs,medicaldevicesandfood.Thelegislationwasprincipallydesignedtoensurethe
timely availability ofsafe and effective drugsand biologics by expediting the premarket reviewprocess fornew
products.Akeyprovisionofthelegislationisthere-authorizationofthePrescriptionDrugUserFeeActof1992,
which permits the continued collection of user fees from prescription drug manufacturers to augment FDA
resources earmarked for the review of human drug applications. This helps provide the resources necessary to
ensure the prompt approval of safe and effective new drugs.
IntheUnitedStates,thegovernmentexpandedhealthcareaccessbyenactingtheMedicarePrescription
Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which was signed into law in December 2003. Prescription
drug coverage began on January 1, 2006. This legislation supports the Company’s goal of improving access to
medicines by expanding insurance coverage, while preserving market-based incentivesfor pharmaceutical inno-
vation.Atthesametime,thelegislationwillensurethatprescriptiondrugcostswillbecontrolledbycompetitive
pressures and by encouraging the appropriate use of medicines. The U.S. Congress has considered, and may
consider again, proposals to increase the government’s role in pharmaceutical pricing in the Medicare program.

9OutsidetheUnitedStates,theCompanyencounterssimilarregulatoryandlegislativeissuesinmostofthe
countries where it does business. There, too, the primary thrust of governmental inquiry and action is toward
determiningdrugsafetyandeffectiveness,oftenwithmechanismsforcontrollingthepricesoforreimbursementfor
prescription drugsandtheprofitsofprescription drugcompanies. TheEUhasadopted directivesconcerning the
classification, labeling, advertising, wholesale distribution and approval for marketing of medicinal products for
humanuse.TheCompany’spoliciesandproceduresarealreadyconsistentwiththesubstanceofthesedirectives;
consequently, it is believed that they will not have any material effect on the Company’s business.
Inaddition,certaincountrieswithintheEU,recognizingtheeconomicimportanceoftheresearch-based

to improve the competitive climate through a variety of means including market deregulation.
The European Commission is conducting a pharmaceutical sector inquiry involving a number of

The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies and is, therefore, subject to
potential administrative actions. Such actions may include seizures of products and other civil and criminal
sanctions.Undercertaincircumstances,theCompanyonitsownmaydeemitadvisabletoinitiateproductrecalls.
The Company believes that it should be able to compete effectively within this environment.

The Company has one drug candidate currently under FDA review:
In August 2007, the FDA accepted for standard review the NDA for Cordaptive, the Company’s
investigational compoundcontainingMerck’sownERniacinandlaropiprant,anovelflushingpathwayinhibitor
designedtoreduceflushingoftenassociated withniacin treatment. Merckanticipates FDAaction inApril2008.
The Company is also moving forward as planned with filings in countries outside the United States.
The Company anticipates filing two NDAs with the FDA in 2008:
The Company anticipates filing an NDA for MK-0524B, a drug candidate that combines the novel
approachtoraisingHDL-cholesterolandloweringtriglyceridesfromERniacincombinedwithlaropiprantwiththe
provenbenefitsofsimvastatininonecombinationproduct.InNovember2007,theCompanypresentedresultsofa
study at the American Heart Association 2007 Scientific Sessions which demonstrate ER niacin/laropiprant
(Cordaptive) coadministered with simvastatin had significant additive effects on reducing LDL-C, increasing
HDL-C and reducing triglyceride levels in a Phase III study with patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or
mixeddyslipidemia.Inthestudy,2g(two1-gramtablets)ofCordaptivecoadministeredwithsimvastatin(pooled
across20mgor40mgdoses)reducedLDL-Cby48%,increasedHDL-Cby28%,andreducedtriglyceridelevelsby
33% following 12 weeks of treatment. The primary study endpoint was LDL-C reduction; secondary endpoints
included increased HDL-C, triglyceride reduction and effects on other lipoproteins. A 1 g tablet of Cordaptive
contains 1 g of Merck-developed ER niacin and 20 mg of laropiprant.
TheCompanyalsoanticipatesfilinganNDAforMK-0364,taranabant,ahighlyselectivecannabinoid-1

generally well-tolerated, however, as reported with another cannabinoid-1 receptor inverse agonist, some dose-
dependent psychiatric adverse events were observed. The Company previously announced the initiation of a
targeted Phase III program in 2006.
Merck currently has seven products in Phase III development (including MK-0524B and MK-0364
discussed above):
MK-0974, an investigational oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, utilizes a new
mechanism forthe treatment ofmigraines that hasdemonstrated efficacyat least comparable totriptans inearly

MK-0822, odanacatib, is an investigational highly selective inhibitor of cathepsin Kenzyme, which is
being evaluated for the treatment of osteoporosis. The cathepsin K enzyme is believed to play a role in both
osteoclastic bone resorption and in degrading the protein component of bone. The inhibition of the cathepsin K
enzyme by the investigational compound odanacatib is a mechanism of action different from that of currently

Environmental Matters
TheCompanybelievesthatitisincomplianceinallmaterialrespectswithapplicableenvironmentallaws

mental protection facilities. The Company is also remediating environmental contamination resulting from past

The Company faces significant litigation related to Vioxx.
OnSeptember30,2004,theCompanyvoluntarilywithdrewVioxx,itsarthritisandacutepainmedication,
fromthemarketworldwide.AsofDecember31,2007,approximately26,500productliabilitylawsuits,involving
approximately 47,275plaintiffgroups,allegingpersonalinjuriesresultingfromtheuseofVioxx,havebeenfiled
against the Company in state and federal courts in the United States. The Company is also a defendant in
approximately262purportedclassactionsrelatedtotheuseofVioxx.(Allofthesesuitsarereferredtoasthe“Vioxx
Product Liability Lawsuits”.) As discussed above, on November 9, 2007, the Company announced that it had
enteredintoanagreement(the“SettlementAgreement”)withthelawfirmsthatcomprisetheexecutivecommittee
of the Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee of the federal multidistrict Vioxx litigation as well as representatives of

Claims of certain individual third-party payors remain pending in the New Jersey court, and counsel
purportingtorepresentalargenumberofthird-partypayorshasthreatenedtofilenumerousadditionalsuchactions.
Activity in the pending cases is currently stayed.
There are also pending in various U.S. courts putative class actions purportedly brought on behalf of
individual purchasers or users of Vioxx and claiming either reimbursement of alleged economic loss or an
entitlement to medical monitoring. All of these cases are at early procedural stages, and no class has been
certified.InNewJersey,thetrialcourtdismissedthecomplaintinthecaseofSinclair,apurportedstatewidemedical

Supreme Court. That court heard argument on October 22, 2007.
In addition to the Vioxx Product Liability Lawsuits, various purported class actions and individual
lawsuits have been brought against the Company and several current and former officers and directors of the
Company alleging that the Company made false and misleading statements regarding Vioxx in violation of the
federalandstatesecuritieslaws(allofthesesuitsarereferredtoasthe“VioxxSecuritiesLawsuits”).Inaddition,

The Company has also been sued by seven states and two counties with respect to the marketing of Vioxx. The

result in potential civil and/or criminal liability.
To date, in the Vioxx product liability litigation, juries have decided in Merck’s favor 12 times and in
plaintiffs’favorfivetimes.OneMerckverdictwassetasidebythecourtandhasnotbeenretried.AnotherMerck

Vioxx product liability litigation is discussed more fully in Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” below.
The outcomes of these Vioxx Product Liability trials should not be interpreted to indicate any trend or
what outcome may be likely in future Vioxx trials.
The Company currently anticipates that a number of Vioxx Product Liability Lawsuits will be tried in
2008.AtrialintheOregonsecuritiescaseisscheduledfor2008,buttheCompanycannotpredictwhetherthistrial
willproceedonscheduleorthetimingofanyoftheotherVioxxShareholderLawsuittrials.TheCompanybelieves
that it has meritorious defenses to the Vioxx Product Liability Lawsuits, Vioxx Shareholder Lawsuits and Vioxx
Foreign Lawsuits (collectively, the “Vioxx Lawsuits”) and will vigorously defend against them. The Company’s
insurancecoveragewithrespecttotheVioxxLawsuitswillnotbeadequatetocoveritsdefensecostsandanylosses.
During 2007, the Company spent $616 million, including $200 million in the fourth quarter, in the
aggregate in legal defense costs worldwide related to (i) the Vioxx Product Liability Lawsuits, (ii) the Vioxx
ShareholderLawsuits,(iii)theVioxxForeignLawsuits,and(iv)theVioxx Investigations (collectively,the“Vioxx

qualifying claimants in the Settlement Program. Thus, the Company’s total reserve for the Vioxx Litigation at
December31,2007was$5.372billion(the“VioxxReserve”).TheVioxxReserveisbasedoncertainassumptions,
describedbelowunder“LegalProceedings”,andisthebestestimateoftheamountthattheCompanybelieves,at
this time, will be spent through 2009.
TheCompanyisnotcurrentlyabletoestimateanyadditionalamountofdamagesthatitmayberequired

CertainoftheCompany’smajorproductsaregoingtolosepatentprotectioninthenearfutureand,
when that occurs, the Company expects a significant decline in sales of those products.
TheCompanydependsuponpatentstoprovideitwithexclusivemarketingrightsforitsproductsforsome
period of time. As product patents for several of the Company’s products have recently expired, or are about to
expire,intheUnitedStatesandinothercountries,theCompanyfacesstrongcompetitionfromlowerpricegeneric
drugs.LossofpatentprotectionforoneoftheCompany’sproductstypicallyleadstoarapidlossofsalesforthat
product, as lower priced generic versions of that drug become available. In the case of products that contribute
significantly to the Company’s sales, the loss of patent protection can have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s results of operations.
Fosamax lost market exclusivity in the United States in February 2008. Fosamax Plus D will lose
marketing exclusivity in the United States in April 2008. As a result of these events, the Company expects
significantdeclinesinU.S.FosamaxandFosamaxPlusDsales.U.S.salesofFosamaxandFosamaxPlusDwere
$2.0 billion in the aggregate in 2007. Sales of Fosamax outside the United States have already been adversely
affected by the availability of generic alendronate sodium products in some markets, including the United
Kingdom, Canada and Germany.
The Company’s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially
successfulproductsandtheCompanymaynotbeabletoacquirecommerciallysuccessfulproductsinother
ways; in consequence, the Companymay not be able to replace sales of successful products that have lost
patent protection.
Likeothermajorpharmaceuticalcompanies,inordertoremaincompetitive,theCompanymustcontinue

During December 2007 and through February 26, 2008, the Company and its joint-venture partner,
Schering-Plough,receivedseveraljointlettersfromtheHouseCommitteeonEnergyandCommerceandtheHouse
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, and one letter from the Senate Finance Committee, collectively
seeking a combination of witness interviews, documents and information on a variety of issues related to the

addition,sincemid-January2008,theCompanyhasbecomeawareoforbeenservedwithapproximately85civil
class action lawsuits alleging common law and state consumer fraud claims in connection with the MSP
Partnership’s sale and promotion of Vytorin and Zetia.
The Company has been closely monitoring sales of Vytorin and Zetia following the release of the
ENHANCEclinicaltrialresultsinapressreleaseonJanuary14,2008.Todate,salesofbothproductsintheU.S.
have been below the Company’s prior expectations. In addition, wholesalers in the U.S. have moderated their
purchases of both products to reduce their inventory levels.
Theseissuesconcerning theENHANCEclinical trial could haveamaterial adverseeffect ontheMSP
Partnership’ssalesofVytorinandZetia.Ifsalesofsuchproductsaremateriallyadverselyaffected,theCompany’s
business, cash flow, results of operations, financial position and prospects could also be materially adversely
affected. In addition, unfavorable outcomes resulting from the government investigations or the consumer fraud
litigation concerning the sale and promotion of these products could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial position, liquidity and results of operations.
The Company’s products, including products in development, can not be marketed unless the
Companyobtains and maintains regulatory approval.
The Company’sactivities, including research, preclinical testing, clinical trials and manufacturing and
marketing its products, are subject to extensive regulation by numerous federal, state and local governmental
authoritiesintheUnitedStates,includingtheFDA,andbyforeignregulatoryauthorities,includingtheEuropean
Commission. In the United States, the FDA is of particular importance to the Company, as it administers
requirements covering the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of
prescription pharmaceuticals. In many cases, the FDA requirements have increased the amount of time and
moneynecessarytodevelopnewproductsandbringthem tomarket intheUnitedStates.Regulation outsidethe
United States also is primarily focused on drug safety and effectiveness and, in many cases, cost reduction. The
20FDAandforeignregulatoryauthoritieshavesubstantialdiscretiontorequireadditionaltesting,todelayorwithhold
registration and marketing approval and to mandate product withdrawals.
EveniftheCompanyissuccessfulindevelopingnewproducts,itwillnotbeabletomarketanyofthose

products in each jurisdiction where approval is required. The Company’s failure to obtain approval, significant
delaysintheapprovalprocess,oritsfailuretomaintainapprovalinanyjurisdictionwillpreventitfromsellingthe
new products in that jurisdiction until approval is obtained, if ever. The Company would not be able to realize
revenues for those new products in any jurisdiction where it does not have approval.
The Company is dependent on its patent rights, and if its patent rights are invalidated or
circumvented, its business would be adversely affected.
Patent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance in the Company’s
marketing of human health products in the United States and in most major foreign markets. Patents covering

21The Company faces intense competition from new products.
The Company’s products face intense competition from competitors’ products. This competition may
increase as new products enter the market. In such an event, the competitors’ products may be safer or more

Company’s products. As a result, if the Company fails to maintain its competitive position, this could have a
material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.
The Company faces pricing pressure with respect to its products.
The Company’s products are subject to increasing price pressures and other restrictions worldwide,
including in the United States. These include (i) practices of managed care groups and institutional and govern-
mental purchasers and (ii) U.S. federal laws and regulations related to Medicare and Medicaid, including the
Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “2003 Act”).
The2003ActincludedaprescriptiondrugbenefitforindividualswhichfirstwentintoeffectonJanuary1,

Unexpected safety or efficacy concerns can arise with respect to marketed products, whether or not

As previously disclosed, on October 29, 2004, two individual shareholders made a demand on the
Company’s Board to take legal action against Mr. Raymond Gilmartin, former Chairman, President and Chief
ExecutiveOfficerandotherindividualsforallegedlycausingdamagetotheCompanywithrespecttotheallegedly
improper marketing of Vioxx. In December 2004, the Special Committee of the Board of Directors retained the
Honorable JohnS.Martin, Jr.of Debevoise&Plimpton LLP toconduct anindependent investigationof,among
other things, the allegations set forth inthe demand. JudgeMartin’sreport wasmade public inSeptember 2006.
BasedontheSpecialCommittee’srecommendationmadeaftercarefulconsiderationoftheMartinreportandthe
impactthatderivativelitigationwouldhaveontheCompany,theBoardrejectedthedemand.OnOctober11,2007,
the shareholders filed a lawsuit in state court in Atlantic County, NJ against current and former executives and
directorsoftheCompanyallegingthattheBoard’srejectionoftheirdemandwasunreasonableandimproper,and
that the defendants breached various duties to the Company in allowing Vioxx to be marketed.

as well as Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Turkey, and Israel.
Additional Lawsuits
Based on media reports and other sources, the Company anticipates that additional Vioxx Product
Liability Lawsuits, Vioxx Shareholder Lawsuits and Vioxx Foreign Lawsuits (collectively, the “Vioxx Lawsuits”)
will be filed against it and/or certain of its current and former officers and directors in the future.
Insurance
As previously disclosed, the Company has product liability insurance for claims brought in the Vioxx
Product Liability Lawsuits with stated upper limits of approximately $630 million after deductibles and co-
31insurance.Thisinsuranceprovidescoverageforlegaldefensecostsandpotential damageamountsinconnection

determine whether anycriminal charges should be brought concerning Vioxx. The Company is cooperating with
these governmental entities in their respective investigations (the “Vioxx Investigations”). The Company cannot
predict the outcome of these inquiries; however, they could result in potential civil and/or criminal dispositions.
As previously disclosed, the Company has received a number of Civil Investigative Demands (“CID”)
fromagroupofAttorneysGeneralfrom31statesandtheDistrictofColumbiawhoareinvestigatingwhetherthe
Company violated state consumer protection laws when marketing Vioxx.The Company is cooperating with the
Attorneys General in responding to the CIDs.

Reserves
Asdiscussedabove,onNovember9,2007,MerckenteredintotheSettlement Agreementwiththelaw
firms that comprise the executive committee of the PSC of the federal Vioxx MDL as well as representatives of
plaintiffs’counselintheTexas,NewJerseyandCaliforniastatecoordinatedproceedingstoresolvestateandfederal

claims,wassignedbythepartiesafterseveralmeetingswiththreeofthefourjudgesoverseeingthecoordinationof
32more than 95 percent of the current claims in the Vioxx Litigation. The Settlement Agreement applies only to
U.S.legalresidentsandthosewhoallegethattheirMIorISoccurredintheUnitedStates.Asaresultofenteringinto
the Settlement Agreement, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $4.85 billion which represents the fixed
aggregate amount to be paid to plaintiffs qualifying for payment under the Settlement Program.
The Company currently anticipates that a number of Vioxx Product Liability Lawsuits will be tried
throughout 2008. A trial in the Oregon securities case is scheduled for 2008, but the Company cannot predict
whetherthistrialwillproceedonscheduleorthetimingofanyoftheotherVioxxShareholderLawsuittrials.The
CompanybelievesthatithasmeritoriousdefensestotheVioxxLawsuitsandwillvigorouslydefendagainstthem.In
viewoftheinherentdifficultyofpredictingtheoutcomeoflitigation,particularlywheretherearemanyclaimants
andtheclaimantsseekindeterminatedamages,theCompanyisunabletopredicttheoutcomeofthesematters,and
at this time cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to the Vioxx Lawsuits not
included in the Settlement Program. The Company has not established any reserves for any potential liability
relating to the Vioxx Lawsuits not included in the Settlement Program or the Vioxx Investigations, including for
those cases in which verdicts or judgments have been entered against the Company,and are nowin post-verdict
proceedingsoronappeal.IneachofthosecasestheCompanybelievesithasstrongpointstoraiseonappealand

Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when
probableandreasonablyestimable.AsofDecember31,2005,theCompanyhadareserveof$685millionsolelyfor
itsfuturelegaldefensecostsrelatedtotheVioxxLitigation.During2006,theCompanyspent$500millioninthe
aggregate in legal defense costs related to the Vioxx Litigation and recorded additional charges of $673 million.
Thus,asofDecember31,2006,theCompanyhadareserveof$858millionsolelyforitsfuturelegaldefensecosts
related to the Vioxx Litigation.
During 2007, the Company spent approximately $616 million in the aggregate, in legal defense costs
worldwiderelated to(i)theVioxx ProductLiability Lawsuits,(ii)theVioxx ShareholderLawsuits,(iii)theVioxx
ForeignLawsuits,and(iv)theVioxxInvestigations(collectively,the“VioxxLitigation”).Inthesecondquarterand
thirdquarterof2007,theCompanyrecordedchargesof$210millionand$70million,respectively,toincreasethe
reserve solely for its future legal defense costs related to the Vioxx Litigation. In increasing the reserve, the
Company considered the same factors that it considered when it previously established reserves for the Vioxx
Litigation.Inthefourthquarter,theCompanyspentapproximately$200millioninVioxxlegaldefensecostswhich
resulted ina reserveof $522 million at December 31, 2007for itsfuture legal defense costsrelated to the Vioxx
Litigation. After entering into the Settlement Agreement, the Company reviewed its reserve for the Vioxx legal
defense costs and allocated approximately $80 million of its reserve to Merck’s anticipated future costs to
administertheSettlementProgram.Someofthesignificantfactorsconsideredinthereviewofthereservewereas

and the inherent inability to predict the ultimate outcomes of such trials and the disposition of Vioxx Product
Liability Lawsuitsnot participating in or noteligible for the Settlement Program, limit the Company’sability to
reasonably estimate its legal costs beyond 2009. Together with the $4.85 billion reserved for the Settlement
Program, the aggregate amount of the reserve established for the Vioxx Litigation as of December 31, 2007 is
approximately $5.372 billion (the “Vioxx Reserve”).
While the Company does not anticipate that it will need to increase the reserve every quarter, it will

33Other Product Liability Litigation
As previously disclosed, the Company is a defendant in product liability lawsuits in the United States
involvingFosamax(the“FosamaxLitigation”).AsofDecember31,2007,approximately403cases,whichinclude
approximately911plaintiffgroupshadbeenfiledandwerependingagainstMerckineitherfederalorstatecourt,

Commercial Litigation
As previously disclosed, the Company was joined in ongoing litigation alleging manipulation by
pharmaceutical manufacturers of Average Wholesale Prices (“AWP”), which are sometimes used in calculations
that determine public and private sector reimbursement levels. In 2002, the JPML ordered the transfer and
consolidation of all pending federal AWP cases to federal court in Boston, Massachusetts. Plaintiffs filed one
consolidatedclassactioncomplaint,whichaggregatedtheclaimspreviouslyfiledinvariousfederaldistrictcourt
actions and alsoexpanded the number ofmanufacturers toinclude somewhich, like the Company,hadnotbeen
defendants in any prior pending case. In May 2003, the court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss the
consolidated class action and dismissed the Company from the class action case. Subsequent to the Company’s
dismissal,theplaintiffsfiledanamendedconsolidatedclassactioncomplaint,whichdidnotnametheCompanyas

obligations under the Medicaid Best Price scheme related to such arrangements. In May 2006, the Company’s
motion todismissthis action wasdenied bythe district court. Thismatter hasalsobeen dismissedaspart ofthe
resolution of the government investigations.
During December 2007 and through February 26, 2008, the Company and its joint-venture partner,
Schering-Plough,receivedseveraljointlettersfromtheHouseCommitteeonEnergyandCommerceandtheHouse
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, and one letter from the Senate Finance Committee, collectively
seeking a combination of witness interviews, documents and information on a variety of issues related to the

position, liquidity and results of operations.
Governmental Proceedings
As previously disclosed, the Company had received a subpoena from the DOJ in connection with its
investigationoftheCompany’smarketingandsellingactivities,includingnominalpricingprogramsandsamples.
The Company had also reported that it has received a CID from the Attorney General of Texas regarding the
Company’s marketing and selling activities relating to Texas. As previously disclosed, the Company received
another CID from the Attorney General of Texas asking for additional information regarding the Company’s
marketingandsellingactivitiesrelatedtoTexas,includingwithrespecttocertainofitsnominalpricingprograms
and samples. In April 2004, the Company received a subpoena from the office of the Inspector General for the
District of Columbia in connection with an investigation of the Company’s interactions with physicians in the
DistrictofColumbia,Maryland,andVirginia.InNovember2004,theCompanyreceivedaletterrequestfromthe

connection with the anticipated resolution of these investigations. Each of the investigations described in the
preceding paragraph has been resolved as part of these settlement agreements.
The settlements described above arose out of civil actions filed under seal in the U.S. District Courts
locatedinPhiladelphiaandNewOrleans.Bothactionscontainedallegationsinvolvingpastpricingprograms.The

thimerosal-containing pediatric vaccines in the United States since the fall of 2001. As of December 31, 2007,
therewere approximately 234 activethimerosal related lawsuitswith approximately 425 plaintiffs. Other defen-
dants include other vaccine manufacturers who produced pediatric vaccines containing thimerosal as well as
manufacturers of thimerosal. In these actions, the plaintiffs allege, among other things, that they have suffered
neurological injuries as a result of exposure to thimerosal from pediatric vaccines. There are no cases currently
scheduled for trial. The Company will defend against these lawsuits; however, it is possible that unfavorable
outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, liquidity and results of

Overview
During2007,Merckbeganrealizingbenefitsfromitsmulti-yearstrategicplandesignedtoreengineerthe

evolution of a new commercial model designed to align the Company’s product research, development and
marketingeffortsutilizingthelatesttechnologiesandbroadeningitsengagementwithcustomers,physiciansand
scientific leaderstogetneededmedicines andvaccinesthroughthedevelopmentpipeline andtopatientssooner.
TheCompanyisalsoworkingtobuildasustainable research anddevelopment advantage byleveraging technol-
ogiestofacilitatedrugdiscoveryanddevelopmentandhassuccessfullyreducedclinicaldevelopmentcycle-time.
TheprogressoftheseeffortsisdemonstratedinpartbytheCompany’srevenuegrowthin2007,which
reflectedthecontinuedmarketpenetrationandglobalrolloutofGardasil,avaccinetohelppreventcervicalcancer,
pre-cancerous and low-grade lesions, vulvar and vaginal pre-cancers, and genital warts caused by human
papillomavirus (“HPV”) types 6, 11, 16 and 18; Januvia, a medicine that enhances a natural body system to
improve blood sugar control in patients with type 2 diabetes; and RotaTeq, a pediatric vaccine to help prevent
rotavirusgastroenteritis ininfants andchildren, coupled withthe strongperformance ofseveral in-line products.
Thisgrowthhasmorethanoffset2007revenuedeclinesassociatedwiththe2006lossofU.S.marketexclusivityfor
Zocor and Proscar.
Additionally,theCompanycontinued theadvancement ofdrugcandidates throughitspipeline. During
2007,theU.S.FoodandDrugAdministration(the“FDA”)approvedbothJanumet,anoralantihyperglycemicagent
that combines sitagliptin (Januvia) with metformin in a single tablet to address all three key defects of type 2
diabetes, and Isentress, a first-in-class integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in treatment-
experienced patients. In addition, on January 25, 2008, the FDA approved Emend for Injection, an intravenous
therapy for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (“CINV”). Also, the Company antic-
ipates the FDAwill take action in 2008 on the New Drug Application (“NDA”) for Cordaptive, the proposed
trademarkforMK-0524A,anextended-release(“ER”)niacincombinedwithlaropiprant,anovelflushingpathway
inhibitor,forcholesterolmanagement.Further,theCompanymadeasupplementalfilingwiththeFDAinJanuary
2008forGardasil,foranexpandedindicationforwomenthroughage45,andanticipatesmakingasupplemental
filing for Isentress later in 2008, for an expanded indication for use in treatment-naïve patients. The Company
currentlyhassevencandidatesinPhaseIIIdevelopmentandanticipatesmakingNDAfilingswithrespecttotwoof
the candidates in 2008: MK-0524B, simvastatin combined with laropiprant and ER niacin, and MK-0364,
taranabant, an investigational medication for the treatment of obesity.
Aspartofimplementingthenewcommercialmodel,theCompanyisreengineeringitscorebusinesstobe
more efficient with the goal of reducing aspects of its cost base and realizing gross margin improvement. The
reengineering includes the implementation of manufacturing and marketing cost savings initiatives. The initial
50phaseoftheglobalrestructuringprogramannouncedin2005wasdesignedtoreducetheCompany’scoststructure,
increaseefficiencyandenhancecompetitiveness.Thescopeofthisinitialphaseincludedtheimplementationofa

and two preclinical sites and eliminated approximately 7,200 positions company-wide (comprised of actual
headcountreductionsandtheeliminationofcontractorsandvacantpositions).TheCompany,however,continuesto
hirenewemployeesasthebusinessrequires.Thepretaxcostsofthisrestructuringprogramsinceinceptionthrough
the end of 2007 were $2.1 billion, of which approximately 70% are non-cash, relating primarily to accelerated
depreciation for those facilities scheduled for closure and approximately 30% represent separation and other
restructuring related costs. These costs were $810.1 million in 2007 and are expected to be approximately
$100million to$300million in2008,atwhichtimetheinitial phaseoftherestructuring programrelating tothe

cost reduction program, combined with cost savings the Company expects to achieve in its marketing and
administrativeandresearchanddevelopmentexpenses,willyieldcumulativepretaxsavingsof$4.5to$5.0billion
from 2006 through 2010.
OnNovember9,2007,Merckenteredintoanagreement(the“SettlementAgreement”)withthelawfirms
that comprise the executive committee of the Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee of the federal multidistrict Vioxx
litigation as well as representatives of plaintiffs’ counsel in state coordinated proceedings to resolve state and
federal myocardial infarction (“MI”)andischemic stroke(“IS”)claims alreadyfiledagainsttheCompanyinthe

favorable impact of gains on sales of assets and product divestitures, as well as a net gain on the settlements of
certain patent disputes. All of these items are discussed more fully in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements.
Competition and the Health Care Environment
The markets in which the Company conducts its business are highly competitive and often highly
regulated. Global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and
access.
IntheUnitedStates,thegovernmentexpandedhealthcareaccessbyenactingtheMedicarePrescription
Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which was signed into law in December 2003. Prescription
51drug coverage began on January 1, 2006. This legislation supports the Company’s goal of improving access to
medicines by expanding insurance coverage, while preserving market-based incentivesfor pharmaceutical inno-
vation.Atthesametime,thelegislationwillensurethatprescriptiondrugcostswillbecontrolledbycompetitive
pressures and by encouraging the appropriate use of medicines. The U.S. Congress has considered, and may
consider again, proposals to increase the government’s role in pharmaceutical pricing in the Medicare program.

Outside the United States, in difficult environments encumbered by government cost-containment
actions, the Company has worked in partnership with payers to encourage them to allocate scarce resources to
optimizehealthcareoutcomes,limitingthepotentiallydetrimentaleffectsofgovernmentpoliciesonsalesgrowth
and access to innovative medicines and vaccines, and to support the discovery and development of innovative

recognized the economic importance of the research-based pharmaceutical industry and the value of innovative
medicinestosociety.Asaresult,theyareworkingwithindustryrepresentativestoimprovethecompetitiveclimate
through a variety of means including market deregulation.
In order to advance the related policy debate, the EC launched the High Level Pharmaceutical Forum
(“HLPF”)attheendof2005.Thisinitiativeaimsatimprovingtheprospectsoftheresearch-basedpharmaceutical

legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an
increasingamountoffocusonprivacyanddataprotectionissueswiththepotentialtoaffectdirectlytheCompany’s
business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of U.S. states requiring security breach notification.
Although no one can predict the outcome of these and other legislative, regulatory and advocacy
initiatives,theCompanyiswellpositionedtorespondtotheevolvinghealthcareenvironmentandmarketforces.
As patents on certain of the Company’s products expire, Merck has entered into, and may continue to
enter into, authorized generic agreements which reduce on a short-term limited basis, the impact of post-patent
expiry sales erosion when these medicines become available in generic form.
The Companyanticipates that theworldwidetrend towardcost-containment willcontinue, resulting in
ongoing pressures on health care budgets. As the Company continues to successfully launch new products,

InMarch2007,MerckandH.LundbeckA/S(“Lundbeck”)announcedthediscontinuationoftheirjoint
development program for gaboxadol, an investigational new medicine for the treatment of insomnia that was in
Phase III development. Data from completed clinical studies suggested that the overall clinical profile for
gaboxadolininsomniadoesnotsupportfurtherdevelopment.Asaresultofthisinformation,MerckandLundbeck
will not file an NDA for gaboxadol for the treatment of insomnia with the FDA, or other regulatory agencies
worldwide, and have terminated ongoing clinical studies.
In September 2007, Merck announced that vaccination in a Phase II clinical trial of the Company’s
investigationalHIVvaccine(V520)wasdiscontinuedbecausethevaccinewasnoteffective.Thetrial,calledSTEP,
was co-sponsored by Merck, the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergies and Infectious
Diseases (“NIAID”) and the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board
(“DSMB”)forSTEPrecommendeddiscontinuationbecausetheSTEPtrialwouldnotmeetitsefficacyendpoints.
In October 2007, the NIAID announced that a separate DSMB for a second clinical trial being conducted in

whethertheyreceivedthevaccineorplacebo,bestronglyencouragedtoreturntostudysitesforprotocol-related
tests, and be counseled about the possibility that those who received the vaccine might have an increased
susceptibility to HIVinfections. Detailed analyses of the available data are being conducted, including analyses
to better understand if there may be an increased susceptibility to HIV infection among those volunteers who
received the vaccine. The vaccine itself does not cause HIVinfection.
InAugust2006,MerckandGileadSciences,Inc.(“Gilead”)establishedanagreementforthedistribution

transcriptase inhibitor, 200 mg of emtricitabine and 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, both nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Efavirenz is marketed by Merck under the tradename Stocrin in all territories
outsideoftheUnitedStates,CanadaandcertainEuropeancountries(whereitiscommercializedbyBristolMyers
Squibb under the tradename Sustiva). Emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are commercialized by
Gilead under the tradenames Emtriva and Viread, respectively. Atripla was approved in the EU in 2007.
Merck continues to remain focused on augmenting its internal efforts by capitalizing on growth
opportunities, ranging from targeted acquisitions to research collaborations, preclinical and clinical compounds
and technology transactions that will drive both near- and long-term growth. The Company completed
55 transactions in 2007 across a broad range of therapeutic categories, as well as early-stage technology
transactions. Merck is currently evaluating other opportunities, and is actively monitoring the landscape for a
range of targeted acquisitions that meet the Company’sstrategic criteria. Highlights from these activities for the
year include:
InJuly2007,MerckandARIADannouncedthattheyhadenteredintoaglobalcollaboration tojointly

In September 2007, Merck completed the acquisition of NovaCardia, a privately held clinical-stage
pharmaceutical company focused on cardiovascular disease. This acquisition added rolofylline (MK-7418),
NovaCardia’s investigational Phase III compound for acute heart failure, to Merck’s pipeline. Merck acquired
alloftheoutstandingequityofNovaCardiaforatotalpurchasepriceof$366.4million(including$16.4millionof
cash and investments on hand at closing), which was paid through the issuance of 7.3 million shares of Merck
common stock tothe former NovaCardia shareholders basedonMerck’saverage closing stockprice forthe five
days prior to closing of the acquisition. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded a charge of
$325.1millionforacquiredresearchassociatedwithrolofyllineasattheacquisitiondate,technologicalfeasibility

Research and development expense, and will be eligible to receive up to $105 million in development and sales
milestone payments, and double-digit tiered royalties on global sales of V270.
Also, in November 2007, Merck and GTx, Inc. (“GTx”) announced that they had entered into an
agreement providing for a research and development and global strategic collaboration for selective androgen
receptor modulators (“SARMs”), a new class of drugs with the potential to treat age-related muscle loss

Restructuring Costs
Restructuring costs were $327.1 million, $142.3 million and $322.2 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, Merck incurred $251.4 million, $113.7 million and $182.4 million,
respectively, in separation costs associated with actual headcount reductions, as well as headcount reductions

Selected Joint Venture and Affiliate Information
Toexpanditsresearchbaseandrealizesynergiesfromcombiningcapabilities,opportunitiesandassets,
in previous years the Company formed a number of joint ventures. (See Note 8 to the consolidated financial
statements.)
Merck/Schering-Plough Partnership
In 2000, the Company and Schering-Plough Corporation (“Schering-Plough”) (collectively, the “Part-
ners”) entered into agreements to create separate equally-owned partnerships to develop and market in the
UnitedStatesnewprescriptionmedicinesinthecholesterol-management andrespiratorytherapeuticareas.These
agreementsgenerallyprovideforequalsharingofdevelopmentcostsandforco-promotionofapprovedproductsby
each company. In 2001, the cholesterol-management partnership agreements were expanded to include all the
countriesoftheworld,excludingJapan.In2002,ezetimibe,thefirstinanewclassofcholesterol-loweringagents,
waslaunchedintheUnitedStatesasZetia(marketedasEzetroloutsidetheUnitedStates).In2004,acombination
product containing the active ingredients of both Zetia and Zocor was approved in the United States as Vytorin
(marketed as Inegy outside the United States).
The cholesterol agreements provide for the sharing of operating income generated by the Merck/
Schering-Plough cholesterol partnership (the “MSP Partnership”) based upon percentages that vary by product,
saleslevelandcountry.IntheU.S.market,thePartnersshareprofitsonZetiaandVytorinsalesequally,withthe
exception of the first $300 million of annual Zetia sales, on which Schering-Plough receives a greater share of
profits.OperatingincomeincludesexpensesthatthePartnershavecontractuallyagreedtoshare,suchasaportion
ofmanufacturingcosts,specificallyidentifiedpromotioncosts(includingdirect-to-consumeradvertisinganddirect
and identifiable out-of-pocket promotion) and other agreed upon costs for specific services such as on-going
clinical research, market support, market research, market expansion, as well as a specialty sales force and
physician education programs. Expenses incurred in support of the MSPPartnership but not shared between the
Partners, such as marketing and administrative expenses (including certain sales force costs), as well as certain
manufacturing costs,are not included inEquity income from affiliates. However,these costs are reflected inthe
overall results of the Company. Certain research and development expenses are generally shared equally by the
Partners, after adjusting for earned milestones.
Sales of joint venture products were as follows:
($ in millions) 2007 2006 2005
Vytorin $2,779.1 $1,955.3 $1,028.3
Zetia 2,407.1 1,928.8 1,396.7
$5,186.2 $3,884.1 $2,425.0
Global sales of Vytorin grew 42% in 2007 and 90% in 2006. Vytorin is the only combination tablet
cholesteroltreatmenttoprovideLDLcholesterolloweringthroughthedualinhibitionofcholesterolproductionand
absorption. Global sales of Zetia increased 25% in 2007 and 38% in 2006.
On January 14, 2008, the MSP Partnership announced the primary endpoint and other results of the
ENHANCE(EffectofCombination Ezetimibe andHigh-DoseSimvastatinvs.SimvastatinAloneontheAthero-

Vytorin has not been shown to reduce heart attacks or strokes more than simvastatin alone.
During December 2007 and through February 26, 2008, the Company and its joint-venture partner,
Schering-Plough,receivedseveraljointlettersfromtheHouseCommitteeonEnergyandCommerceandtheHouse
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, and one letter from the Senate Finance Committee, collectively
seeking a combination of witness interviews, documents and information on a variety of issues related to the
ENHANCE clinical trial, the sale and promotion of Vytorin, as well as sales of stock by corporate officers. On

have been below the Company’s prior expectations. In addition, wholesalers in the U.S. have moderated their
purchases of both products to reduce their inventory levels.
The respiratory therapeutic agreements provide for the joint development and marketing in the
United States by the Partners of a once-daily, fixed-combination tablet containing the active ingredients
montelukast sodium and loratadine. Montelukast sodium, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, is sold by Merck
asSingulairandloratadine,anantihistamine,issoldbySchering-PloughasClaritin,bothofwhichareindicatedfor

In1982,theCompanyenteredintoanagreementwithAstraAB(“Astra”)todevelopandmarketAstra

In conjunction with the 1998 restructuring for a payment of $443.0 million, which was recorded as
deferred income, Astra purchased an option (the “Asset Option”) to buy Merck’s interest in the KBI products,
excluding the gastrointestinal medicines Nexium and Prilosec (the “Non-PPI Products”). The Asset Option is
exercisable in the first half of 2010 at an exercise price equal to the net present value as of March 31, 2008 of

As previously disclosed, Merck’s Canadian tax returns for the years 1998 through 2004 are being
examined bythe Canada Revenue Agency(“CRA”). InOctober 2006,the CRAissued the Companya notice of
reassessment containing adjustments related to certain intercompany pricing matters, which result in additional
Canadian and provincial tax due of approximately $1.6 billion (U.S. dollars) plus interest of approximately
$810million(U.S.dollars).Inaddition,inJuly2007,theCRAproposedadditionaladjustmentsfor1999relatingto
another intercompany pricing matter. The adjustments would increase Canadian tax due by approximately
$22 million (U.S. dollars) plus $21 million (U.S. dollars) of interest. It is possible that the CRAwill propose

73Financial Instruments Market Risk Disclosures
Foreign Currency Risk Management
While the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, a significant
portion of the Company’s revenues are denominated in foreign currencies. Merck relies on sustained cash flows
generated from foreign sources to support its long-term commitment to U.S.dollar-based research and develop-
ment.Totheextentthedollarvalueofcashflowsisdiminishedasaresultofastrengtheningdollar,theCompany’s

The Company’sinvestment portfolio includes cash equivalents and short-term investments, the market

The Company maintains a returns policy that allowsits customers to return product within a specified
periodpriortoandsubsequenttotheexpirationdate(generally,sixmonthsbeforeandtwelvemonthsafterproduct
expiration). The estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience with actual returns.
Additionally,theCompanyconsidersfactorssuchaslevelsofinventoryinthedistributionchannel,productdating
and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued, entrance in the market of additional generic
competition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, among others. The product returns
provision, as well as actual returns, were less than 1.0% of net sales in 2007, 2006 and 2005.
Throughitsdistributionprogram withU.S.wholesalers, theCompanyencourages wholesalers toalign
purchaseswithunderlyingdemandandmaintaininventorieswithinspecifiedlevels.Thetermsoftheprogramallow
the wholesalers to earn fees upon providing visibility into their inventory levels as well as by achieving certain
performance parameters, such as, inventory management, customer service levels, reducing shortage claims and

probableandreasonablyestimable.AsofJanuary1,2006,theCompanyhadareserveof$685millionsolelyforits
future legal defense costs related to the Vioxx Litigation (as defined below). During 2006, the Company spent

of$673million.Accordingly,asofDecember31,2006,theCompanyhadareserveof$858millionsolelyforits
future legal defense costs related to the Vioxx Litigation. During 2007, the Company spent $616 million in the
aggregate in legal defense costs worldwide related to (i) the Vioxx Product Liability Lawsuits, (ii) the Vioxx
ShareholderLawsuits,(iii)theVioxxForeignLawsuits,and(iv)theVioxx Investigations (collectively,the“Vioxx
Litigation”). Inthesecondquarterandthirdquarterof2007,theCompanyrecordedchargesof$210millionand

AfterenteringintotheSettlementAgreement,theCompanyrevieweditsreservefortheVioxxlegaldefensecosts
and allocated approximately $80 million of its reserve to Merck’s anticipated future costs to administer the
Settlement Program. Someof the significant factors considered in the reviewof the reservewere asfollows:the
actual costsincurredbytheCompany;thedevelopment oftheCompany’slegaldefensestrategyandstructurein
light of the scope of the Vioxx Litigation, including the Settlement Agreement and the expectation that the
SettlementAgreementwillbeconsummated,butthatcertainlawsuitswillcontinuetobepending;thenumberof
cases being brought against the Company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current
informationregardinganticipatedtiming,progression,andrelatedcostsofpre-trialactivitiesandtrialsintheVioxx
ProductLiabilityLawsuits.Eventssuchasscheduledtrialsthatareexpectedtooccurthroughout2008and2009,
andtheinherent inability topredict theultimate outcomesofsuchtrials andthedispositionoftheVioxxProduct
Liability Lawsuitsnot participating in or noteligible for the Settlement Program, limit the Company’sability to
reasonably estimate its legal costs beyond 2009. Together with the $4.85 billion reserved for the Settlement
Program, the aggregate amount of the reserve established for the Vioxx Litigation as of December 31, 2007 was
approximately$5.372billion.WhiletheCompanydoesnotanticipatethatitwillneedtoincreasethereserveevery
quarter,itwillcontinuetomonitoritslegaldefensecostsandreviewtheadequacyoftheassociatedreservesand
maydeterminetoincreaseitsreservesforlegaldefensecostsatanytimeinthefutureif,baseduponthefactorsset
forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so.
The Company currently anticipates that a number of Vioxx Product Liability Lawsuits will be tried
throughout 2008. A trial in the Oregon securities case is scheduled for 2008, but the Company cannot predict
whetherthistrialwillproceedonscheduleorthetimingofanyoftheotherVioxxShareholderLawsuittrials.The
CompanybelievesthatithasmeritoriousdefensestotheVioxxLawsuitsandwillvigorouslydefendagainstthem.In
viewoftheinherentdifficultyofpredictingtheoutcomeoflitigation,particularlywheretherearemanyclaimants
andtheclaimantsseekindeterminatedamages,theCompanyisunabletopredicttheoutcomeofthesematters,and
at this time cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to the Vioxx Lawsuits not
included in the Settlement Program. The Company has not established any reserves for any potential liability
relating to the Vioxx Lawsuits not included in the Settlement Program or the Vioxx Investigations, including for
those cases in which verdicts or judgments have been entered against the Company,and are nowin post-verdict

AsofDecember31,2007,theCompanyhadaremainingreserveofapproximately$27millionsolelyfor
its future legal defense costs for the Fosamax Litigation. Some of the significant factors considered in the

initially performed to assess all sites for potential contamination resulting from past industrial activities. Where

better evaluation of the need for remedial action. Where such need was identified, remedial action was then

TheCompanybelievesthatitisincomplianceinallmaterialrespectswithapplicableenvironmentallaws

Share-Based Compensation
TheCompanyrecognizescompensationcostrelatingtoshare-basedpaymenttransactionsinNetincome

FAS123Rrequiresallshare-basedpaymentstoemployees,includinggrantsofstockoptions,toberecognizedin
Net income as compensation expense based on fair value over the requisite service period of the awards. The
Company determines the fair value of certain share-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
which uses both historical and current market data to estimate the fair value. This method incorporates various
assumptionssuchastherisk-freeinterestrate,expectedvolatility,expecteddividendyieldandexpectedlifeofthe

5. Financial Instruments
Foreign Currency Risk Management
While the U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, a significant
portion of the Company’s revenues are denominated in foreign currencies. Merck relies on sustained cash flows
generated from foreign sources to support its long-term commitment to U.S.dollar-based research and develop-
ment.Totheextentthedollarvalueofcashflowsisdiminishedasaresultofastrengtheningdollar,theCompany’s
ability to fund research and other dollar-based strategic initiatives at a consistent level may be impaired. The
Company has established revenue hedging and balance sheet risk management programs to protect against

Merck/Schering-Plough
In 2000, the Company and Schering-Plough Corporation (“Schering-Plough”) (collectively the “Part-
ners”) entered into agreements to create separate equally-owned partnerships to develop and market in the
99UnitedStatesnewprescriptionmedicinesinthecholesterol-management andrespiratorytherapeuticareas.These
agreementsgenerallyprovideforequalsharingofdevelopmentcostsandforco-promotionofapprovedproductsby
each company. In 2001, the cholesterol-management partnership agreements were expanded to include all the
countriesoftheworld,excludingJapan.In2002,ezetimibe,thefirstinanewclassofcholesterol-loweringagents,
waslaunchedintheUnitedStatesasZetia(marketedasEzetroloutsidetheUnitedStates).In2004,acombination
product containing the active ingredients of both Zetia and Zocor, was approved in the United States as Vytorin
(marketed as Inegy outside of the United States).
The cholesterol agreements provide for the sharing of operating income generated by the Merck/
Schering-Plough cholesterol partnership (the “MSP Partnership”) based upon percentages that vary by product,
saleslevelandcountry.IntheU.S.market,thePartnersshareprofitsonZetiaandVytorinsalesequally,withthe
exception of the first $300 million of annual Zetia sales on which Schering-Plough receives a greater share of
profits.OperatingincomeincludesexpensesthatthePartnershavecontractuallyagreedtoshare,suchasaportion
ofmanufacturingcosts,specificallyidentifiedpromotioncosts(includingdirect-to-consumeradvertisinganddirect
and identifiable out-of-pocket promotion) and other agreed upon costs for specific services such as on-going
clinical research, market support, market research, market expansion, as well as a specialty sales force and
physician education programs. Expenses incurred in support of the MSPPartnership but not shared between the
Partners, such as marketing and administrative expenses (including certain sales force costs), as well as certain
manufacturing costs,are not included inEquity income from affiliates. However,these costs are reflected inthe
overall results of the Company. Certain research and development expenses are generally shared equally by the
Partners, after adjusting for earned milestones.
See Note 10 for information with respect to litigation involving the MSP Partnership and the Partners
related to the sale and promotion of Zetia and Vytorin.
The respiratory therapeutic agreements provide for the joint development and marketing in the
United States by the Partners of a once-daily, fixed-combination tablet containing the active ingredients
montelukast sodium and loratadine. Montelukast sodium, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, is sold by Merck
asSingulairandloratadine,anantihistamine,issoldbySchering-PloughasClaritin,bothofwhichareindicatedfor

and such revenuewas $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, primarily
relating to sales of Nexium, as well as Prilosec. In addition, Merck earns certain Partnership returns which are
recorded in Equity income from affiliates as reflected in the table above. Such returns include a priority return
providedforinthePartnershipAgreement,variablereturnsbased,inpart,uponsalesofcertainformerAstraUSA,
Inc. products, and a preferential return representing Merck’s share of undistributed AZLP GAAP earnings. The
AstraZeneca merger triggers a partial redemption of Merck’s limited partnership interest in 2008. Upon this
redemption, AZLP will distribute to KBI an amount based primarily on a multiple of Merck’s average annual
variablereturnsderivedfromsalesoftheformerAstraUSA,Inc.productsforthethreeyearspriortotheredemption
(the “Limited Partner Share of Agreed Value”).
In conjunction with the 1998 restructuring, for a payment of $443.0 million, which was recorded as
deferred income, Astra purchased an option (the “Asset Option”) to buy Merck’s interest in the KBI products,
excluding the gastrointestinal medicines Nexium and Prilosec (the “Non-PPI Products”). The Asset Option is
exercisable in the first half of 2010 at an exercise price equal to the net present value as of March 31, 2008 of
projected future pretax revenue to be received by the Company from the KBI products (the “Appraised Value”).

There are also pending in various U.S. courts putative class actions purportedly brought on behalf of
individual purchasers or users of Vioxx and claiming either reimbursement of alleged economic loss or an
entitlement to medical monitoring. All of these cases are at early procedural stages, and no class has been

November 2007. That motion is pending.
In addition, as previously disclosed, various putative class actions filed in federal court under the
EmployeeRetirementIncomeSecurityAct(“ERISA”)againsttheCompanyandcertaincurrentandformerofficers
and directors (the “Vioxx ERISA Lawsuits” and, together with the Vioxx Securities Lawsuits and the Vioxx
Derivative Lawsuits, the “Vioxx Shareholder Lawsuits”) have been transferred to the Shareholder MDL and

As previously disclosed, on October 29, 2004, two individual shareholders made a demand on the
Company’s Board to take legal action against Mr. Raymond Gilmartin, former Chairman, President and Chief
ExecutiveOfficerandotherindividualsforallegedlycausingdamagetotheCompanywithrespecttotheallegedly
improper marketing of Vioxx. In December 2004, the Special Committee of the Board of Directors retained the
Honorable JohnS.Martin, Jr.of Debevoise&Plimpton LLP toconduct anindependent investigationof,among
other things, the allegations set forth inthe demand. JudgeMartin’sreport wasmade public inSeptember 2006.
BasedontheSpecialCommittee’srecommendationmadeaftercarefulconsiderationoftheMartinreportandthe
impactthatderivativelitigationwouldhaveontheCompany,theBoardrejectedthedemand.OnOctober11,2007,
the shareholders filed a lawsuit in state court in Atlantic County, NJ against current and former executives and
directorsoftheCompanyallegingthattheBoard’srejectionoftheirdemandwasunreasonableandimproper,and
that the defendants breached various duties to the Company in allowing Vioxx to be marketed.

as well as Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Turkey, and Israel.
110Additional Lawsuits
Based on media reports and other sources, the Company anticipates that additional Vioxx Product
Liability Lawsuits, Vioxx Shareholder Lawsuits and Vioxx Foreign Lawsuits (collectively, the “Vioxx Lawsuits”)
will be filed against it and/or certain of its current and former officers and directors in the future.
Insurance
As previously disclosed, the Company has product liability insurance for claims brought in the Vioxx
Product Liability Lawsuits with stated upper limits of approximately $630 million after deductibles and co-
insurance.Thisinsuranceprovidescoverageforlegaldefensecostsandpotential damageamountsinconnection
withtheVioxxProductLiabilityLawsuits.TheCompany’sinsurancecoveragewithrespecttotheVioxxLawsuits
will not be adequate to cover its defense costs and losses.
As previously disclosed, the Company’s upper level excess insurers (which provide excess insurance
potentiallyapplicabletoalloftheVioxxLawsuits)hadcommencedanarbitrationseeking,amongotherthings,to
cancel those policies, tovoid all oftheir obligations under those policies and toraise other coverage issueswith

these governmental entities in their respective investigations (the “Vioxx Investigations”). The Company cannot
predict the outcome of these inquiries; however, they could result in potential civil and/or criminal dispositions.
As previously disclosed, the Company has received a number of Civil Investigative Demands (“CID”)

Reserves
Asdiscussedabove,onNovember9,2007,MerckenteredintotheSettlement Agreementwiththelaw
firms that comprise the executive committee of the PSC of the federal Vioxx MDL as well as representatives of
plaintiffs’counselintheTexas,NewJerseyandCaliforniastatecoordinatedproceedingstoresolvestateandfederal

claims,wassignedbythepartiesafterseveralmeetingswiththreeofthefourjudgesoverseeingthecoordinationof
more than 95 percent of the current claims in the Vioxx Litigation. The Settlement Agreement applies only to
U.S.legalresidentsandthosewhoallegethattheirMIorISoccurredintheUnitedStates.Asaresultofenteringinto
the Settlement Agreement, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $4.85 billion which represents the fixed
aggregate amount to be paid to plaintiffs qualifying for payment under the Settlement Program.
The Company currently anticipates that a number of Vioxx Product Liability Lawsuits will be tried
throughout 2008. A trial in the Oregon securities case is scheduled for 2008, but the Company cannot predict
whetherthistrialwillproceedonscheduleorthetimingofanyoftheotherVioxxShareholderLawsuittrials.The
CompanybelievesthatithasmeritoriousdefensestotheVioxxLawsuitsandwillvigorouslydefendagainstthem.In
viewoftheinherentdifficultyofpredictingtheoutcomeoflitigation,particularlywheretherearemanyclaimants
andtheclaimantsseekindeterminatedamages,theCompanyisunabletopredicttheoutcomeofthesematters,and
at this time cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to the Vioxx Lawsuits not
included in the Settlement Program. The Company has not established any reserves for any potential liability
relating to the Vioxx Lawsuits not included in the Settlement Program or the Vioxx Investigations, including for
those cases in which verdicts or judgments have been entered against the Company,and are nowin post-verdict
proceedingsoronappeal.IneachofthosecasestheCompanybelievesithasstrongpointstoraiseonappealand
thereforethatunfavorableoutcomesinsuchcasesarenotprobable.UnfavorableoutcomesintheVioxxLitigation
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, liquidity and results of operations.
Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when
probableandreasonablyestimable.AsofDecember31,2005,theCompanyhadareserveof$685millionsolelyfor
itsfuturelegaldefensecostsrelatedtotheVioxxLitigation.During2006,theCompanyspent$500millioninthe
aggregate in legal defense costs related to the Vioxx Litigation and recorded additional charges of $673 million.
Thus,asofDecember31,2006,theCompanyhadareserveof$858millionsolelyforitsfuturelegaldefensecosts
related to the Vioxx Litigation.
During 2007, the Company spent approximately $616 million in the aggregate, in legal defense costs
worldwiderelated to(i)theVioxx ProductLiability Lawsuits,(ii)theVioxx ShareholderLawsuits,(iii)theVioxx
ForeignLawsuits,and(iv)theVioxxInvestigations(collectively,the“VioxxLitigation”).Inthesecondquarterand
thirdquarterof2007,theCompanyrecordedchargesof$210millionand$70million,respectively,toincreasethe
reserve solely for its future legal defense costs related to the Vioxx Litigation. In increasing the reserve, the
Company considered the same factors that it considered when it previously established reserves for the Vioxx
Litigation.Inthefourthquarter,theCompanyspentapproximately$200millioninVioxxlegaldefensecostswhich
resulted ina reserveof $522 million at December 31, 2007for itsfuture legal defense costsrelated to the Vioxx
Litigation. After entering into the Settlement Agreement, the Company reviewed its reserve for the Vioxx legal
defense costs and allocated approximately $80 million of its reserve to Merck’s anticipated future costs to
administertheSettlementProgram.Someofthesignificantfactorsconsideredinthereviewofthereservewereas

informationregardinganticipatedtiming,progression,andrelatedcostsofpre-trialactivitiesandtrialsintheVioxx
ProductLiabilityLawsuits.Eventssuchasscheduledtrials,thatareexpectedtooccurthroughout2008and2009,
and the inherent inability to predict the ultimate outcomes of such trials and the disposition of Vioxx Product
112Liability Lawsuitsnot participating in or noteligible for the Settlement Program, limit the Company’sability to
reasonably estimate its legal costs beyond 2009. Together with the $4.85 billion reserved for the Settlement
Program, the aggregate amount of the reserve established for the Vioxx Litigation as of December 31, 2007 is
approximately$5.372billion(the“VioxxReserve”).AsofDecember31,2007,$2.122billionoftheVioxxReserve
is included in Accrued and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
While the Company does not anticipate that it will need to increase the reserve every quarter, it will
continuetomonitoritslegaldefensecostsandreviewtheadequacyoftheassociatedreservesandmaydetermineto

would be appropriate to do so.
Other Product Liability Litigation
As previously disclosed, the Company is a defendant in product liability lawsuits in the United States
involvingFosamax(the“FosamaxLitigation”).AsofDecember31,2007,approximately403cases,whichinclude
approximately911plaintiffgroupshadbeenfiledandwerependingagainstMerckineitherfederalorstatecourt,

Commercial Litigation
As previously disclosed, the Company was joined in ongoing litigation alleging manipulation by
pharmaceutical manufacturers of Average Wholesale Prices (“AWP”), which are sometimes used in calculations
that determine public and private sector reimbursement levels. In 2002, the JPML ordered the transfer and
consolidation of all pending federal AWP cases to federal court in Boston, Massachusetts. Plaintiffs filed one
consolidatedclassactioncomplaint,whichaggregatedtheclaimspreviouslyfiledinvariousfederaldistrictcourt
actions and alsoexpanded the number ofmanufacturers toinclude somewhich, like the Company,hadnotbeen
defendants in any prior pending case. In May 2003, the court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss the
consolidated class action and dismissed the Company from the class action case. Subsequent to the Company’s
dismissal,theplaintiffsfiledanamendedconsolidatedclassactioncomplaint,whichdidnotnametheCompanyas

pricing and other marketing and pricing inducements to certain customers and also failed to comply with its
obligations under the Medicaid Best Price scheme related to such arrangements. In May 2006, the Company’s
motion todismissthis action wasdenied bythe district court. Thismatter hasalsobeen dismissedaspart ofthe
resolution of the government investigations.
During December 2007 and through February 26, 2008, the Company and its joint-venture partner,
Schering-Plough,receivedseveraljointlettersfromtheHouseCommitteeonEnergyandCommerceandtheHouse
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, and one letter from the Senate Finance Committee, collectively
seeking a combination of witness interviews, documents and information on a variety of issues related to the
ENHANCE clinical trial, the sale and promotion of Vytorin, as well as sales of stock by corporate officers. On

investigations or the consumer fraud litigation could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
position, liquidity and results of operations.
Governmental Proceedings
As previously disclosed, the Company had received a subpoena from the DOJ in connection with its
investigationoftheCompany’smarketingandsellingactivities,includingnominalpricingprogramsandsamples.
The Company had also reported that it has received a CID from the Attorney General of Texas regarding the
Company’s marketing and selling activities relating to Texas. As previously disclosed, the Company received
another CID from the Attorney General of Texas asking for additional information regarding the Company’s
marketingandsellingactivitiesrelatedtoTexas,includingwithrespecttocertainofitsnominalpricingprograms
and samples. In April 2004, the Company received a subpoena from the office of the Inspector General for the
District of Columbia in connection with an investigation of the Company’s interactions with physicians in the
DistrictofColumbia,Maryland,andVirginia.InNovember2004,theCompanyreceivedaletterrequestfromthe
DOJ in connection with its investigation of the Company’s pricing of Pepcid.
On February 7, 2008, the Company announced that it entered into agreements with the government to

reasonable feesandexpensestothefederal government,49statesparticipating intheMedicaidprogram andthe
District of Columbia. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $671 million in
connection with the anticipated resolution of these investigations. Each of the investigations described in the
preceding paragraph has been resolved as part of these settlement agreements.
The settlements described above arose out of civil actions filed under seal in the U.S. District Courts
locatedinPhiladelphiaandNewOrleans.Bothactionscontainedallegationsinvolvingpastpricingprograms.The
PhiladelphiasettlementrelatestopastprogramsinwhichtheCompanyofferedhospitalssignificantlydiscounted

continued to operate as the Flex-NP Program until its termination in April 2001. The New Orleans settlement
accounts for $250 million plus interest of the total settlement amount.
Inconnectionwiththesesettlements,theCompanyenteredintoacorporateintegrityagreementwiththe

The Company has cooperated with all of these investigations. In addition to these investigations, from
time to time, other federal, state or foreign regulators or authorities may seek information about practices in the

and class action product liability lawsuits and claims in the United States involving pediatric vaccines (e.g.,
hepatitis B vaccine) that contained thimerosal, a preservative used in vaccines. Merck has not distributed
thimerosal-containing pediatric vaccines in the United States since the fall of 2001. As of December 31, 2007,
therewere approximately 234 activethimerosal related lawsuitswith approximately 425 plaintiffs. Other defen-
dants include other vaccine manufacturers who produced pediatric vaccines containing thimerosal as well as
manufacturers of thimerosal. In these actions, the plaintiffs allege, among other things, that they have suffered
neurological injuries as a result of exposure to thimerosal from pediatric vaccines. There are no cases currently
scheduled for trial. The Company will defend against these lawsuits; however, it is possible that unfavorable
outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, liquidity and results of
operations.

Companycommon stockatthefair market value atthe time ofgrant.Inaddition tostockoptions,theCompany
grants performance share units (“PSUs”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to certain management level
employees. These plans were approved by the Company’s shareholders. At December 31, 2007, 149.8 million
shares were authorized for future grants under the Company’s share-based compensation plans. The Company
settles employee share-based compensation awards primarily with treasury shares.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted FAS 123R. Employee share-based compensation
expense was previously recognized using the intrinsic value method which measures share-based compensation
expense as the amount at which the market price of the stock at the date of grant exceeds the exercise price.
FAS123Rrequirestherecognitionofthefairvalueofshare-basedcompensationinnetincome,whichtheCompany
recognizesonastraight-linebasisovertherequisiteserviceperiod.Additionally,theCompanyelectedthemodified
prospective transition method for adopting FAS 123R, and therefore, prior periods were not retrospectively
adjusted.Underthismethod,theprovisionsforFAS123RapplytoallawardsgrantedormodifiedafterJanuary1,
2006. In addition, the unrecognized expense of awards that have not yet vested at the date of adoption are
recognized in net income in the relevant period after the date of adoption. Also effective January 1, 2006, the
Companyadopted FASBStaffPosition123R-3,Transition Election Related to Accounting forthe TaxEffects of
Share-Based Payment Awards, which provides the Company an optional short-cut method for calculating the
historical pool of windfall tax benefits upon adopting FAS 123R.
The following table provides amounts of share-based compensation cost recorded in the Consolidated
Statement of Income (substantially all of the 2005 amounts were related to RSUs):
Years Ended December 31 2007 2006 2005

Forpurposesofproformadisclosure,theestimatedfairvalueofawardsatthedateofgrant,includingthosegranted
to retirement-eligible employees, is amortized to expense over the requisite service period. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per common share if the Company had applied the fair value
method for recognizing employee share-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2005:
Year Ended December 31 2005
Net income, as reported $4,631.3

the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Upon the adoption of FAS 123R, compensation expense is being
recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees or over the period from the grant
date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved. This approach is known as the non-substantive vesting period
approach. If the Company had been applying this approach for stock options granted to retirement-eligible
employees,theeffectonproformaearningspershareassumingdilutionfortheyearendedDecember31,2005,as

As previously disclosed, Merck’s Canadian tax returns for the years 1998 through 2004 are being
examined bythe Canada Revenue Agency(“CRA”). InOctober 2006,the CRAissued the Companya notice of
129reassessment containing adjustments related to certain intercompany pricing matters, which result in additional
Canadian and provincial tax due of approximately $1.6 billion (U.S. dollars) plus interest of approximately
$810million(U.S.dollars).Inaddition,inJuly2007,theCRAproposedadditionaladjustmentsfor1999relatingto
another intercompany pricing matter. The adjustments would increase Canadian tax due by approximately
$22 million (U.S. dollars) plus $21 million (U.S. dollars) of interest. It is possible that the CRAwill propose
similaradjustmentsforlateryears.TheCompanydisagreeswiththepositionstakenbytheCRAandbelievesthey

The IRSrecently beganits examination ofthe Company’s2002to2005federal income tax returns. In

At December 31, 2007, foreign earnings of $17.2 billion havebeen retained indefinitely by subsidiary
companies for reinvestment. No provision will be made for income taxes that would be payable upon the
distributions of such earnings and it is not practicable to determine the amount of the related unrecognized
deferred income tax liability. In addition, the Company has subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico and Singapore
under tax incentive grants that expire in 2015 and 2026, respectively. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

Notes to Combined Financial Statements
1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
Description of Business
In May 2000, Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck”) and Schering-Plough Corporation (“Schering-Plough”)
(collectively“Management”orthe“Partners”)enteredintoagreements(the“Agreements”)tojointlydevelopand
market in the United States, Schering-Plough’s then investigational cholesterol absorption inhibitor (“CAI”)
ezetimibe (marketed today in the United States as ZETIA and as EZETROL in most other countries) (the
“CholesterolCollaboration”)andafixed-combinationtabletcontainingtheactiveingredientsmontelukastsodium
andloratadine(the“RespiratoryCollaboration”).Montelukastsodium,aleukotrienereceptorantagonist,issoldby
MerckasSINGULAIRandloratadine,anantihistamine,issoldbySchering-PloughasCLARITIN,bothofwhich
are indicated for the relief of symptoms of allergic rhinitis.
The Cholesterol Collaboration is formally referred to as the Merck/Schering-Plough Cholesterol Part-
nership (the “Partnership”). In December 2001, the Cholesterol Collaboration Agreements were expanded to
includeallcountriesoftheworld,exceptJapan.TheCholesterolCollaborationAgreementsprovideforezetimibeto
be developed and marketed in the following forms:
(cid:129) Ezetimibe,aoncedailyCAI,non-statincholesterolreducingmedicineusedaloneorco-administered
with any statin drug, and
(cid:129) Ezetimibe and simvastatin (Merck’s existing ZOCOR statin cholesterol modifying medicine) com-
binedintoonetablet(marketedtodayintheUnitedStatesasVYTORINandasINEGYinmostother
countries).
VYTORIN and ZETIAwere approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2004 and
October 2002, respectively. Together, these products, whether marketed as VYTORIN, ZETIA or under other
trademarks locally, are referred to as the “Cholesterol Products.”
Under the Cholesterol Collaboration Agreements, the Partners established jointly-owned, limited pur-
poselegalentitiesbasedinCanada,PuertoRico,andtheUnitedStatesthroughwhichtocarryoutthecontractual
activitiesofthePartnershipinthesecountries.Anadditionaljointly-owned,limitedpurposelegalentitybasedin
Singapore was established to own the rights to the intellectual property and to fund and oversee research and

ProductsundercontractwiththePartnership.Theselegalentityandsubsidiaryoperationsarecollectivelyreferred
toasthe“CombinedCompanies.”InLatinAmerica,thePartnershipsellsdirectlytoSchering-PloughandMerck’s
Latin American subsidiaries and Schering-Plough and Merck compete against one another in the cholesterol
market. Consequently, selling, promotion and distribution activities for the Cholesterol Products within Latin
America are not included in the Combined Companies.

Basis of Presentation
The accompanying combined balance sheets and combined statements of net sales and contractual
expenses,cashflowsandpartners’capital(deficit)includetheCholesterolandRespiratoryCollaborationactivities
of the Combined Companies. The Respiratory Collaboration activities primarily pertain to clinical development
workandpre-launchmarketingactivities.Spendingonrespiratory-related activitiesisnotmaterialtotheincome
from operations in any of the years presented. In August 2007, the Partners announced that the New Drug
Applicationfilingformontelukastsodium/loratadinehadbeenacceptedbytheU.S.FoodandDrugAdministration
for standard review. The Partners are seeking U.S. marketing approval of the medicine for treatment of allergic
rhinitis symptoms in patients whowant relief from nasal congestion.
NetsalesincludethenetsalesoftheCholesterolProductssoldbytheCombinedCompanies.Expenses
includeamountsthatMerckandSchering-PloughhavecontractuallyagreedtodirectlyinvoicetothePartnership,or
are shared through the contractual profit sharing arrangements between the Partners, as described above.
The accompanying combined financial statements were prepared for the purpose of complying with
certainrulesandregulationsoftheSecuritiesandExchangeCommissionandreflecttheactivitiesofthePartnership
based on the contractual agreements between the Partners. Such combined financial statements include only the
expenses agreed by the Partners to be shared or included in the calculation of profits under the contractual
agreementsofthePartnership,andarenotintendedtobeacompletepresentationofallofthecostsandexpenses
that would be incurred by a stand-alone pharmaceutical company for the discovery, development, manufacture,
distribution and marketing of pharmaceutical products.
UndertheCholesterolCollaborationAgreements,certainactivitiesarechargedtothePartnershipbythe
Partners based on contractually agreed upon allocations of Partner-incurred expenses as described below. In the
opinionofManagement,anyallocationsofexpensesdescribedbelowaremadeonabasisthatreasonablyreflects
theactuallevelofsupportprovided.AllotherexpensesareexpensesofthePartnersandaccordingly,arereflectedin

2. Summaryof Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Combination
The accompanying combined balance sheets and combined statements of net sales and contractual
expenses,cashflowsandpartners’capital(deficit)includetheCholesterolandRespiratoryCollaborationactivities
of the Combined Companies. Interpartnership balances and profits are eliminated.
Use of Estimates
ThecombinedfinancialstatementsarepreparedbasedoncontractualagreementsbetweenthePartners,
as described above, and include certain amounts that are based on Management’s best estimates and judgments.
Estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for sales discounts and returns and government and
managedcarerebates.Becauseoftheuncertaintyinherentinsuchestimates,actualresultsmaydifferfromthese
estimates.
146Foreign Currency Translation
ThenetassetsofthePartnership’sforeignoperationsaretranslatedintoU.S.dollarsatcurrentexchange
rates. The U.S. dollar effects arising from translating the net assets of these operations are included in Partners’
capital (deficit), and are not significant.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of highly liquid money market instruments with original
maturities of less than three months. In 2007, the Partnership changed certain cash management practices,
increasing the amount of cash held by the Partnership. The Partnership’s cash, which is primarily invested in
highly liquid money market instruments, is used to fund trade obligations coming due in the month and for
distributionstothePartners.Interestincomeearnedoncashandcashequivalentsisreportedin“Selling,generaland
administrative”intheaccompanyingcombinedstatementsofnetsalesandcontractualexpensesandamountedto
$8 million, $5 million and $2 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Inventories
Substantially all inventories are valued at the lower of first in, first out cost or market.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets consist of licenses, trademarks and trade names owned by the Partnership. These
intangible assets were recorded at the Partners’ historical cost at the date of contribution, at a nominal value.
Revenue Recognition, Rebates, Returns and Allowances
Revenue from sales of Cholesterol Products are recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the
customer.Recognitionofrevenuealsorequiresreasonableassuranceofcollectionofsalesproceedsandcompletion
ofallperformanceobligations.NetsalesofVYTORIN/INEGYare$2,779million,$1,955millionand$1,028mil-

$1,397 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
In the United States, sales discounts are issued to customers as direct discounts at the point-of-sale or
indirectlythroughanintermediarywholesalepurchaser,knownaschargebacks,orindirectlyintheformofrebates.
Additionally,salesaregenerallymadewithalimitedrightofreturnundercertainconditions.Revenuesarerecorded

Reserves for chargebacks, discounts and returns and allowances are reflected as a direct reduction to accounts

rebates are reflected as “Rebates payable,” shown separately in the combined balance sheets.
Income Taxes
Generally,taxableincomeorlossesofthePartnershipareallocatedtothePartnersandincludedineach

No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). Adoption of FIN 48 had no impact on the
Partnership’s financial statements.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
ThePartnership’sconcentrationsofcreditriskconsistprimarilyofaccountsreceivable.AtDecember31,
2007, three customers each represented 28%, 27% and 15% of “Accounts receivable, net.” These same three

The Partnership sells Cholesterol Productsdirectly tothe Partners, principally to Merckand Schering-
Plough affiliates in Latin America. In Latin America, where the Partners compete with one another in the
cholesterol market, Merck and Schering-Plough purchase Cholesterol Products from the Partnership and sell
directly tothirdparties.SalestoPartnersareincludedin“Netsales”attheirinvoicedpriceintheaccompanying
combined statements of net sales and contractual expenses and are $82 million, $61 million, and $36 million in
2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

costs associated with litigation and investigation activities are expensed as incurred.
In February 2007, Schering-Plough received a notice from Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, a generic
company, indicating that it had filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application for a generic form of ZETIA and
that it is challenging the U.S. patents that are listed for ZETIA. Schering-Plough and the Partnership intend to

monitoring sales of the Cholesterol Products following release of the ENHANCE clinical trial results. To date,
2008 net sales of the Cholesterol Products have been below the Partnership’s prior expectations.

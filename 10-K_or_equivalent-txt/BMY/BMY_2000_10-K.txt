Item 1. BUSINESS
DESCRIPTION OF BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANYGeneral:
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ("Bristol-MyersS quibb" or the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in August
1933 under the name Bristol-Myers Company as successor to a New York business started in 1887. In 1989, the Bristol-Myers Company changed
its name to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, as a result of a merger. The Company, through its divisions and subsidiaries, is a major producer and
distributor in one significant business segment - medicines. Operations of the Nutritional and ConvaTec businesses are not material to the financial
statements. In general, the business of the Company is not seasonal.
On September 28, 2000, the Company announced the planned divestiture of its Clairol and Zimmer businesses in 2001. The Company announced
on February 22, 2001 its intention to separate the Zimmer business in a tax-free spin-off to shareholders. Completion is expected by the end of the
third quarter of 2001. Accordingly, the operations of these businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations in the financial statements.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS
In general, Bristol-Myers Squibb purchases its principal raw materials and supplies in the open market. Substantially all such materials are obtainable
from a number of sources so that the loss of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES
The Company owns or is licensed under a number of patents in the United States and foreign countries covering products, and has also developed
many brand names and trademarks for products. The Company considers the overall protection of its patent, trademark and license rights to be of
material value and acts to protect these rights from infringement. In the years 2001 and 2002 exclusivity periods are scheduled to expire or have
expired for MONOPRIL* and certain TAXOL* claims. The Company believes that no single patent or license is of material importance in relation to
the business as a whole.
COMPETITION, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMERS
The markets in which Bristol-Myers Squibb competes are generally broad-based and highly competitive. The principal means of competition utilized
to market the products of Bristol-Myers Squibb include quality, service, price and product performance. Pharmaceutical products and the products
of ConvaTec are promoted on a national and international basis in medical journals and directly to the medical profession. The Company is also
utilizing direct-to-consumer advertising for a number of its pharmaceutical products. Most of the other products of Bristol-Myers Squibb are
generally advertised and promoted on a national and international basis through the use of television, radio, print media, consumer offers, and window
and in-store displays. Bristol-Myers Squibb's products are principally sold to the wholesale and retail trade both nationally and internationally. Certainproducts are also sold to other drug manufacturers, hospitals and the medical profession. Two wholesalers accounted for approximately 13% and
12% of net sales from continuing operations in 2000.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development is essential to Bristol-Myers Squibb's business. Pharmaceutical research and development is carried out by the Bristol-
Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute,w hich has major facilities in Princeton, Hopewell and New Brunswick, New Jerseya nd
Wallingford, Connecticut. Pharmaceutical research and development is also carried out at various other facilities in the United States and in Belgium,
Canada, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. Management continues to emphasizel eadership, innovation and productivity as strategies for success
in the Research Institute.
Bristol-Myers Squibb spent $1,939 million in 2000, $1,759 million in 1999 and $1,506 million in 1998 on Company sponsored research and
development activities. Pharmaceutical research and development spending, as a percentage of pharmaceutical sales, was 13.0% in 2000 compared
with 12.6% in 1999 and 12.4% in 1998.
REGULATION
Most aspects of the Company's business are subject to some degree of government regulation in the countries in which its operations are conducted.
The Company's policy is to comply fully with all regulatory requirements applying to its products and operations. For some products, and in some
countries, government regulation is significant and, in general, there is a trend to more stringent regulation. The Company devotes significant time,
effort and expense addressing the extensive governmental regulatory requirements applicable to its business. Governmental regulatory actions can
result in the recall or seizure of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the production or sale of a product, and other civil
and criminal sanctions.
In the United States, the drug, medical device, diagnostic and food industries in which the Company operates have long been subject to regulation by
various federal, state and local agencies, primarily as to product manufacture, safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling.
In addition, governmental bodies in the United States as well as other countries have expressed concern about costs relating to health care and, in
some cases, have focused attention on the pricing of drugs and on appropriate drug utilization. Government regulation in these areas already exists in
some countries and may be expanded significantly in the United States and other countries in the future.
While the Company is unable to predict the extent to which its business may be affected by future regulatory developments, it believes that its
substantial experience dealing with governmental regulatory requirements and restrictions on its operations throughout the world and its development
of new and improved products should enable it to compete effectively within this environment.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature considered normal to its businesses are pending against the Company and certain of its
subsidiaries. The most significant of these are described below.
Reference is made to Note 17 Litigation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report.
Breast Implant Litigation
The Company, together with its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation (MEC), and certain other companies, has been named as a defendant in
a number of claims and lawsuits alleging damages for personal injuries of various types resulting from polyurethane-covered breast implants and
smooth-walled breast implants formerly manufactured by MEC or a related Company. Of the more than 90,000 claims or potential claims against the
Company in direct lawsuits or through registration in the nationwide class action settlement approved by the Federal District Court in Birmingham,
Alabama (the "Revised Settlement"), most have been dealt with through the Revised Settlement, other settlements, or trial. As of December 31,
2000, the Company's contingent liability in respect of breast implant claims was limited to residual unpaid Revised Settlement obligations and to
roughly 850 remaining opt-outs who have pursued or may pursue their claims in court.
As of December 31, 2000, approximately 4,790 United States and 310 foreign breast implant recipients were plaintiffs in lawsuits pending in federal
and state courts in the United States and certain courts in Canada and Australia. These figures include the claims of plaintiffs that are in the process of
being settled and/or dismissed. In these lawsuits, about 2,140 US and 68 foreign plaintiffs opted out of the Revised Settlement. The lawsuits of the
2,650 US plaintiffs who did not opt out are expected to be dismissed since these plaintiffs are among the estimated 74,000 women with MEC
implants who chose to participate in the nationwide settlement. Of the 2,140 opt-out plaintiffs, an estimated 1,290 have claims based upon products
that were not manufactured or sold by MEC or that have been or are in the process of being settled and/or dismissed. Accordingly, the number of
remaining plaintiffs who have pursued or may pursue their claims in court against the Company is roughly 850, as stated in the preceding paragraph.
Under the terms of the Revised Settlement, additional opt-outs are expected to be minimal since the deadline for US class members to opt out has
passed. In addition, the Company's remaining obligations under the Revised Settlement Program are limited because most payments to "Current
Claimants" have already been made, no additional "Current Claims" may be filed without court approval, and because payments of claims to so-
called "Other Registrants" and "Late Registrants" are limited by the terms of the Revised Settlement. Separate class action settlements have been
approved in the provincial courts of Ontario and Quebec, and an agreement has been reached under which other foreign breast implant recipients
may settle their claims. The Company believes it will be able to address remaining opt-out claims as well as expected remaining obligations under the
Revised Settlement Program within its reserves described below.
Breast implants were manufactured by several companies, including MEC, which the Company acquired in 1982. Until 1991, MEC manufactured
two types of breast implants, polyurethane-covered silicone breast implants and smooth-walled silicone breast implants. In these lawsuits, plaintiffs
typically contend that silicone in breast implants causes systemic disease and/or local complications. Some plaintiffs with polyurethane-covered
silicone implants contend that the polyurethane component causes injury, including cancer. Most of the disease claims involve non-specific complaints
such as chronic fatigue, aches and pains and other symptoms that commonly affect the population at large. Many women claim local complications
such as rupture, hardening or contracture, and disfigurement or scarring. The plaintiffs typically seek compensatory damages for alleged medical
conditions and emotional distress as well as punitive damages. The defendants have based their defense in part on the lack of credible scientific
evidence that breast implants cause disease. Many large-scale epidemiological studies have found no connection between breast implants and the
alleged diseases. Defendants also contend that warnings set forth in the product literature adequately advised physicians and surgeons of the risks of
local complications.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
7The Company is a participant in the national class action Revised Settlement Program approved on December 22, 1995, by the federal court in
Alabama (Lindsey, et al., v. Dow Corning, et al., CV-94-P-11558-S), before which all federal breast implant cases were consolidated for pretrial
purposes. On January 16, 1996, the Company, Baxter Healthcare Corporation and Baxter International (collectively, Baxter), and Minnesota,
Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M) (hereinafter, the Settling Defendants) each paid $125 million into a court-established fund as an initial
reserve to pay claims under the Revised Settlement. The Company has made and will make additional contributions to the court-established fund.
The fifteen-year Revised Settlement, which ends on December 15, 2010, provides benefits to those US breast implant recipients who have had at
least one breast implant manufactured by one of the Settling Defendants (or their related companies). For Current Claimants- those who submitted
the proper documentation to the Claims Office in Houston by the 1994 deadline - benefits are payable regardless of the number of claimants seeking
compensation, and regardless of the total dollar value of approved claims. For Other and Late Registrants - those who registered with the Claims
Office after the Current Claimant deadline - benefits are subject to an aggregate $725 million limit for the three Settling Defendants over the fifteen-
year life of the program. The Company's individual aggregate limit for such benefits is $400 million, $27.6 million annually for the first ten years, and
$24.8 million annually for the last five years. Amounts unused in one year may be rolled over to pay claims in ensuing years. In the event the dollar
value of the claims subject to these limits were to exceed the amounts available to pay claims, claimants may be afforded additional opt-out rights but
without the right to assert punitive or other statutory multiple damage claims. The Company's obligations to make payments under the Revised
Settlement are not affected by the number of class members electing to opt out of the settlement or the number of class members making claims under
it except to the extent of the above-mentioned dollar limits.
In addition to individual suits and the Lindsey class action, the Company is a defendant, together with other defendants, in a class action certified on
April 11, 1996, in the Canadian province of British Columbia, on the single issue of whether silicone gel breast implants are reasonably fit for their
intended purpose (Harrington v. Dow Corning Corporation et al., Supreme Court, British Columbia, C954330). On March 31,2 000, the federal
government filed a civil suit in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, against several parties in the breast implant litigation, including the Company.
The government claims it is entitled to reimbursement for certain costs allegedly incurred in connection with the medical treatment provided to women
with breast implants. The Company believes it will be able to address the government lawsuit within its reserves as described below.
The Company entered into several other settlements of breast implant-related claims. In July of 1995, the Company entered into a $20.5 million (US
funds) class action settlement with plaintiff representatives in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The class includes persons who have or had MEC
breast implants and who reside in Ontario
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
8
and Quebec or who received their MEC implants there. The settlement, which had minimal opt-outs, was approved by the provincial courts of
Ontario and Quebec. In May of 1996, the Company, together with other Settling Defendants in the Revised Settlement Program, enteredi nto a $50
million settlement of claims asserted by certain health insurers based upon payments made or benefits provided by insurers and represented health
plans to participating registrants that allegedly involve or relate to silicone gel breast implants. The Company has contributed $22.5 million to the
settlement which extinguished the potential claims of the majority of the US commercial and non-governmental health care insurer market against both
the defendants and settlement class members. In November 1996, the benefits of the Revised Settlement were extended, with certain modifications,
to foreign breast implant recipients. The Company paid roughly $5.3 million into a court-approved fund in settlement of these claims.
The Company's insurers were notified of the breast implant claims and the Revised Settlement, and a number reserved their rights or declined
coverage. The Company reached settlement with many of these insurers in connection with coverage litigation filed by it in state court in Texas. In
1993, the Company offset its breast implant product liability special charges by $1.0 billion of expected insurance proceeds (recorded as Insurance
Recoverable). Because of its belief that additional amounts of insurance proceeds above that amount will be recovered, the Company recorded an
additional Insurance Recoverable in the fourth quarter of 1998 of approximately $100 million. As a result of certain settlements, the Company has
recovered or reached agreements to recover the $1.1 billion offset amount.
While there have been a few large judgments, defendants have won more trials than they have lost, and the Company's trial experience has been
mostly favorable. The Company has maintained throughout this litigation that breast implants do not cause disease, and medical and scientific data
support the Company's position. The Company's view has found support in the trial courts. Courts in several states have ruled to exclude the
testimony of plaintiffs' experts concerning a causal link between silicone gel breast implants and systemic illness on the ground that it fails to satisfy
standards for reliability under current US Supreme Court guidelines. In 1998, a national science panel of four independent experts appointed by the
federal court issued its unanimous report, based on a comprehensive review of the medical and scientific literature, that there is no evidence linking
silicone breast implants and systemic disease. Similarly, in 1999, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences - while commenting
that the frequency of local injuries is greater than expected - concluded there is insufficient evidence to link silicone breast implants with disease. The
Company intends to dispose of the claims of remaining opt-outs by continuing to implement its plan to settle cases at values it deems acceptable, and
to wage a vigorous defense, including taking cases to trial, of those cases that do not settle at such values.
In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a charge of $500 million before taxes ($310 million after taxes) in respect of breast implant
cases. The charge consisted of $1.5 billion for potential liabilities and expenses, offset by $1.0 billion of expected insurance proceeds. In the fourth
quarters of 1994 and 1995, the Company recorded additional special charges of $750 million before taxes ($488 million after taxes) and $950
million before taxes ($590 million after taxes), respectively, related to breast implant product liability claims. In the fourth quarter of 1998, the
Company recorded an additional special charge to earnings in the amount of $800 million before taxes and increased its insurance receivable in the
amount of $100 million, resulting in a net charge to earnings of $433 million after taxes in respect of breast implant product liability claims.
TAXOL* LitigationIn 1997 and 1998, the company filed several lawsuits alleging that a number of generic drug companies infringed its patents covering methods of
administering paclitaxel when they filed abbreviated new drug applications seeking regulatory approval to sell paclitaxel. These actions were
consolidated for discovery in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The company does not assert am onetary claim against
any of the defendants, but seeks to prevent the defendants from marketing paclitaxel in a manner that violates the company's patents.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
9
The defendants have asserted that they do not infringe the company's patents and that these patents are invalid and unenforceable. Some defendants
also asserted counterclaims seeking damages for alleged antitrust and unfair competition violations. The company believes its patents are valid and the
counterclaims asserted are without merit.
On January 4, 2000, the District Court granted the company's motion to dismiss certain of the antitrust and unfair competition counterclaims. The
company's motion for summary judgment on the remaining antitrust and unfair competition counterclaims was denied on March 17, 2000. On
February 29, 2000, the District Court granted in part the generic companies' summary judgment motions for invalidity by finding all claims of the
Company's patents invalid, except for claims limited to the treatment of ovarian cancer. The District Court's opinion left for determination at trial the
validity of the claims of the Company's patents directed to the low dose, three-hour administration of paclitaxel for ovarian cancer and denied the
generic companies' summary judgment motion arguing non-infringement of the Company's patents.
In order to pursue an immediate appellate review of the District Court's invalidity findings, the Company voluntarily relinquished all rights in the
remaining ovarian tumor specific claims of its patents. On April 7, 2000, the District Court granted the company's request for an entry of judgment.
The Company's appeal of the District Court's judgment is pending before the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. If the company is successful on
appeal and the trial that would follow a successful appeal, the company believes its remaining patent rights would apply to all tumor types.
In September 2000, one of the defendants received final approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration for its Abbreviated New
Drug Application (ANDA) for paclitaxela nd is marketing the product. FDA approvals of additional ANDAs for paclitaxelc an occur at any time
beginning in April 2001.
It is not possible at this time to make a reasonable assessment of the outcome of the appeal and the remaining claims in these actions nor to
reasonably estimate the impact on TAXOL* sales or the amount of damages were the company not to prevail.
VANLEV* Litigation
The Company, its Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. Heimbold, Jr. and its ChiefS cientific Officer and President -
Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Peter S. Ringrose, Ph.D., are defendants in a number of purported class actions filed in the US District Court for
the District of New Jersey in April, May and June2 000 alleging violations of federal securities laws and regulations. Plaintiffs claim that the
defendants disseminated materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose information concerning the safety and expected availability of
its product VANLEV* during the period November 8, 1999 through April 19, 2000. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and costs and expenses.
It is not possible at this time to make a reasonable assessment of the outcome of this matter or the amount of damages were the Company not to
prevail.
Environmental Matters
The Company, together with others, is a party to, or otherwise involved in, a number of proceedings brought by the Environmental Protection Agency
or comparable state agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act( CERCLA or Superfund) or
comparable state laws directed at the cleanup of hazardous waste sites.

While it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these cases, it is the opinion of management that they will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's operating results, liquidity or consolidated financial position.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Summary
In September 2000, the Company announced the planned divestitures of the Zimmer and Clairol businesses. Accordingly, their results have been
reported as discontinued operations and excluded from consolidated sales and expenses for all years. In February 2001, the Company announced its
intention to separate the Zimmer business in a tax-free spin-off to shareholders. This transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the third
quarter of 2001.
In 2000, Bristol-Myers Squibb reported $18.2 billion in annual global sales, an increase of 8% (11% excluding foreign exchange) over 1999.
Domestic sales, representing 67% of worldwide sales, increased 14% to $12.1 billion, while international sales decreased 2% (a 5% increase
excluding foreign exchange) to $6.1 billion. Sales growth resulted from an 8% increase due to volume, a 3% increase from changes in selling prices
and a 3% decrease due to exchange rate fluctuations. Total Company sales including discontinued operations increased 5% (8% excluding foreign
exchange) to $21.3 billion.
The Company's most important product lines made significant contributions to the Company's sales growth, many of which experienced double-digit
growth on a worldwide basis. Three products, PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL* (paclitaxel) and GLUCOPHAGE, each exceeded $1.5 billion ainn nual
sales, while five additional products exceeded $500 million in annual sales. Bristol-Myers Squibb had 54 product lines with more than $50 million in
annual sales, including 31 with more than $100 million in annual sales.
Total Company earnings (continuing and discontinued operations) before income taxes increased 12% to $6.5 billion from $5.8 billion in 1999. Net
earnings increased 13% to $4.7 billion; basic and diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $2.40 and 15% to $2.36, respectively. Earnings from
continuing operations before income taxes, excluding restructuring charges and gain on sales of businesses, increased 13% to $5.8 billion in 2000.
Net earnings, on this basis, increased 14% to $4.3 billion; basic and diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $2.19 and 16% to $2.16,
respectively. Over the past five years, net earnings and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding gains from sales of businesses
and restructuring and special charges, have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 14%. This growth rate enabled the Company to achieve
its goal of doubling 1993 earnings and earnings per share by the end of 2000.
In 2000, consistent with the Company's mission to extend and enhance human life and to develop the highest quality products, the Company invested
more than $1.9 billion in research and development, a 10% increase over the prior year. Research and development expenditure dedicated to
pharmaceutical products increased 14% over 1999 with a compound annualized rate of 14% over the past five years. This significant investment has
led to the discovery of innovative new products and the development of new indications for existing products leading, in 2000, to eight regulatory
approvals and the filing of three dossiers in the US Notable approvals included GLUCOVANCEa, new oral combination drug, and
GLUCOPHAGE XR Extended Release Tablets, a once-dailvye rsion of GLUCOPHAGE, both for diabetes; VANIQA*, a topical treatment for
unwanted facial hair in women; and VIDEX* EC, a once-a-day, easier-to-digest, enteric-coated form of VIDEX* for HIV/AIDS.
Also in 2000, the Company announced a number of research alliances, collaborations and commercialization agreements with other companies,
including a global agreement (excluding Japan) with Novartis AG to codevelop and copromote tegaserod, Novartis's new investigational drug
treatment for irritable bowel syndrome; and a drug discovery alliance in the field of genomics with 3-Dimensional Pharmaceuticals, Inc., under which
the Company will receive worldwide rights to compounds discovered or developed through the collaboration. This agreement is one of more than a
dozen major genomics agreements the Company has entered into over the past three years.

Bristol-Myers Squibb's financial position remains strong. At December 31, 2000, the Company held almost $3.4 billion in cash, time deposits and
marketable securities. Cash provided by operating activities reached $4.7 billion, the highest in the past 10 years. Returns to shareholders included
dividend distributions of $1.9 billion and stock repurchases of $2.3 billion. Dividends per common share were $.98 in 2000, increasing from $.86 pershare paid in 1999. In December 2000, the Company announced a dividend increase, the 29th consecutive year that dividends have increased. The
2001 indicated annual payment is $1.10 per common share, a 12% increase over 2000. As further evidence of its strong financial position, Bristol-
Myers Squibb is one of only seven US industrial companies to receive a triple-A credit rating from both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
Net Sales
Sales increased 8% in 2000 to $18.2 billion, compared with increases of 12% and 10% in 1999 and 1998, respectively. The consolidated sales
growth in 2000 resulted from an 8% increase due to volume, a 3% increase due to changes in selling prices and a 3% decrease due to foreign
exchange rate fluctuations. In 1999, the 12% increase in sales reflected an 11% increase due to volume, a 2% increase due to changes in selling
prices and a 1% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. In 1998, the 10% increase in sales reflected an 11% increase due to volume, a
2% increase due to changes in selling prices and a 3% decrease due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Domestic sales increased 14% in 2000 and
19% in 1999, while international sales decreased 2% in 2000 (a 5% increase excluding foreign exchange) and increased 2% in 1999 (5% excluding
foreign exchange). In general, the business of the Company is not seasonal.
In 2000, worldwide pharmaceutical sales increased 11% with US pharmaceutical sales up 18% over the prior year. Key pharmaceutical product
sales include:
Sales of PRAVACHOL*, a cholesterol-loweringa gent and the Company's largest selling product, increased 7% to $1,817 million primarily as a
result of an increase in retail prescriptions. Domestic sales increased 9% to $1,127 million, while international sales increased 3% (14% excluding
foreign exchange) to $690 million.
GLUCOPHAGE sales increased3 2% to $1,732 million. GLUCOPHAGE, the leading branded oral medication for treatmenot f non-insulin
dependent (type 2) diabetes, had a market share of 33.4% in 2000, up from 31.3% in the prior year. The marketing exclusivity for GLUCOPHAGE
expired in September 2000; however, no generic competition existed at the end of the year. During the year, the Company received FDA approval
for
GLUCOVANCE, an importanta dvance in diabetes treatment, and for GLUCOPHAGE XR Extended Release tabletsa, once-daily version of
GLUCOPHAGE. Sales of GLUCOVANCE and GLUCOPHAGE XR since their launches were $110 million and $50 million, respectively.
Sales of TAXOL*, the Company's leading anticancer agent, increased 7% to $1,592 million as the product continued to benefit from increased use in
ovarian, breast and non-small cell lung cancer following standard chemotherapy. Generic paclitaxel became available in the US during the third
quarter of 2000.
Sales of PLAVIX, an anti-plateletm edication, increased 65% to $903 million. Results of the landmark CURE trial( Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina
to Prevent Recurrent Ischemic Events), jointly sponsored by the company and Sanofi-Synthelabo, were announced in March 2001. In this
international trial of more than 12,500 patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or non-Q wave myocardial infarction), PLAVIX was
significantly superior to standard therapies, including aspirin, in reducing a cluster of clinical events: heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death.
Sales of AVAPRO, an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension, increased 49% to $381 million. AVAPRO and PLAVIX
are cardiovascular products that were launched from the Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Synthelabo joint venture.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
21
Sales of BUSPAR*, the Company's novela ntianxiety agent, increased 17% to $709 million. The US anxiolytic use patent expired in June 2000. The
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the companya n additional six months exclusivity based on its performance of pediatric studies. In
November 2000, the Company received a patent covering the anxiolytic use of a BUSPAR* metabolite, a compound produced in the body by the
oral administration of BUSPAR* and buspirone itself. The patent was subsequently de-listed duringt he course of litigation brought by generic
manufacturers. On March 28, 2001, three generic manufacturers received final approval from the FDA for their respective Abbreviated New Drug
Applications (ANDAs) for buspirone. Each of these threeA NDAs covers a separate dosage strength of buspirone. FDA approvals of additional
ANDAs for buspirone (of any dosage strength) can occur at any time beginning in September 2001. The litigation is on-going.

chemotherapy treatment, increased 23% to $108 million.

year, an increase of 21% over 1999.Nonpharmaceutical sales included sales of BUFFERIN*, which increased 10% (5% excluding foreign exchange)t o $161 million due to increased
sales in Japan, while sales of EFFERALGAN*a, n effervescent analgesic sold primarily in France, increased 4% (20% excluding foreign exchange)
to $172 million.

Earnings
In 2000, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, excluding the nonrecurring items described below, increased 13% to $5,826
million from $5,158 million in 1999. Net earnings, on this basis, increased 14% to $4,309 million compared with $3,789 million in 1999. Basic
earnings per share increased 15% to $2.19 from $1.91 in the prior year and diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $2.16 from $1.87. Net
earnings margins increased to 23.7% in 2000 from 22.4% in 1999. In 1999, net earnings were $3,789 million, an 18% increase over 1998, excluding
the nonrecurring items described below. On this basis, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share both increased 18% over 1998 and net
earnings margins increased to 22.4% in 1999 from 21.4% in 1998.
The Company recorded certain nonrecurring items ("nonrecurring items") in 2000 to earnings of continuing operations, including the gain on sales of
businesses (three pharmaceutical products - Estrace Cream, Ovcon 35 and Ovcon 50 as well as its Sea Breeze brandi n Japan) of $160 million
before taxes, $116 million after taxes or $.06 per diluted share; as well as restructuring charges of $508 million before taxes, $329 million after taxes
or $.17 per diluted share, in connection with workforce reductions and asset write-downs related to the consolidation and closure of plants and
facilities and other expenses. In 1998, the Company recorded certain nonrecurring items to earnings of continuing operations, including the gain on
sales of businesses (Ban, A/S GEA and Hexachimie) of $201 million beforet axes, $125 million after taxes or $.06 per diluted share; as well as
restructuring charges of $157 million before taxes, $98 million after taxes or $.05 per diluted share in connection with asset write-downs and

$800 million before taxes, $495 million after taxes, or $.24 per diluted share, to augment the reserve for breast implant liability and for prescription
drug pricing litigation, offset by expected insurance recoveries.

24.4% in 1998. The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, excluding the nonrecurring items, was
26.0% in 2000, compared with 26.5% in 1999, and 26.8% in 1998. The effective income tax rate has decreased since 1998 due to increased
income in lower tax jurisdictions.
Total Company earnings (continuing and discontinued operations) before taxes increased 12% to $6,486 million from $5,767 million in 1999. Net
earnings increased 13% to $4,711 million compared with $4,167 million in 1999. Basic earnings per share increased 14% to $2.40 from $2.10 in the
prior year and diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $2.36 from $2.06. In 1999, net earnings were $4,167 million, an increase of 15% from
$3,636 million in 1998, excluding the special charge. On this basis, basic earnings per share were $2.10 and diluted earnings per share were $2.06,
both increasing 15% over 1998.
Expenses
Total costs and expenses, excluding the nonrecurring items, as a percentage of sales, improved over the past three years to 68.0% in 2000 compared
with 69.4% in 1999, and 70.8% in 1998.
Cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, improved to 26.1% in 2000 from 26.9% in 1999, principally due to manufacturing efficiencies. In
1999, cost of products sold as a percentage of sales increased to 26.9%, compared with 25.9% in 1998, principally due to sales growth of lower
margin products from the Oncology Therapeutics Network.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Advertising and promotion expenses increased 8% over the prior year to $1,672 million in 2000, primarily as a result of a direct-to-consumer
campaign for PRAVACHOL* and launch spendingf or GLUCOVANCE and TEQUIN*. In 1999, advertising and promotion expenses increased
2% from 1998 to $1,549 million. As a percentage of sales, advertising and promotion expenses remained at prior year levels of 9.2% and decreased
from 10.1% in 1998, reflecting an improvement in the effectiveness of the advertising and promotion spending.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 21.2% in 2000 from 22.4% in 1999 and 24.5% in 1998. This
decreasing trend is a result of slower rates of increase in marketing, sales force and general administrative expenses compared with revenue increases
in the same period.
The Company's investment in research and development totaled $1,939 million in 2000, an increase of 10% over 1999, and to 10.6% in 2000, as a
percentage of sales, compared with 10.4% in 1999 and 10.0% in 1998. This spending level reflects the Company's commitment to research over a
broad range of therapeutic areas and to clinical development of new products. Over the past five years, research and development expenses have
increased at a compound annual growth rate of 11%. In 2000, research and development spending dedicated to pharmaceutical products increased14%, and was 13.0% of pharmaceutical sales compared with 12.6% and 12.4% in 1999 and 1998, respectively.
As described in the notes to the financial statements, in the first quarter of 2000, the Company completed the sale of three pharmaceutical products -
Estrace Cream, Ovcon 35 and Ovcon 50 as well as its Sea Breeze brand in Japan. In 1999, the Company acquired CAL-C-TOSE*a, leading
nutritional milk modifier product in Mexico. Also, in 1999, the Company completed the sale of Laboratori Guieu, SpA, an Italian-based
gynecological, pediatric and dermatological products business. In 1998, the Company acquired Dong-A Biotech Co., Ltd., a marketer and
distributor of pharmaceutical products in South Korea. Also, in 1998, the Company divested its Ban brand of anti-perspirants and deodorants; A/S
GEA, a Denmark-based generic drug business; and Hexachimie, a specialty chemical manufacturer based in France.
Discontinued Operations
Clairol sales decreased 6% to $1,894 million. Domestic sales decreased 4% while international sales decreased 9% (8% excluding foreign
exchange). In 1999, Clairol sales increased 4% to $2,020 million from $1,940 million in 1998.
Zimmer sales increased 9% to $1,053 million, led by an increase in sales of knee joint replacements of 10% to $416 million, of hip replacements of
14% to $329 million and of fracture management products of 15% to $145 million. In 1999, Zimmer sales increased 5% to $963 million from $919
million in 1998.
As described in the notes to the financial statements, in the third quarter of 2000, the Company completed the sale of Matrix Essentials, Inc. (Matrix),
an affiliate of Clairol. Matrix sales for the first six months of 2000 were $168 million and were $361 million for the full year in 1999.
As described in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 2000 and 1998 the Company recorded restructuring charges to discontinued operations of $34
million and $44 million before taxes, respectively, primarily in connection with workforce reductions. In 2000, the Company recorded a pretax gain
of $402 million ($240 million after taxes) on the sale of Matrix. The gain is included in the gain on disposal of discontinued operations.
As a result of the restructuring charges, net earnings from discontinued operations were $375 million in 2000 and $391 million in 1998. Net earnings
from discontinued operations, excluding the restructuring charges, increased 5% to $397 million in 2000 and decreased 10% to $378 million in 1999.

Geographic Areas
Bristol-Myers Squibb products are available in virtually every country in the world; the Company's largest markets are the US, France, Japan,
Germany and Canada.
Sales in the United States increased 14% in 2000. Products with strong growth in the region included GLUCOPHAGEP, LAVIX, BUSPAR*,
PARAPLATIN* and AVAPRO. In 1999, sales in the United Statesin creased 19%, primarily due to growth of GLUCOPHAGE, TAXOL*,
ENFAMIL*, BUSPAR*, PLAVIX, PARAPLATIN* and AVAPRO.
Sales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa decreased 9% in 2000. Sales increased 3%, excluding foreign exchange, as a result of growth in France due to
increased sales of PRAVACHOL* and EFFERALGAN*p,a rtially offset by decreased sales of CAPOTEN* due to generic competition;i n Italy
due to increased sales of TAXOL* and AVAPRO; and in Spain due to increaseds ales of PRAVACHOL*, AVAPRO and PLAVIX. Excluding
foreign exchange, sales in Germany were 2% below prior year levels due to increased emphasis on generics and governmental spending controls. In
1999, sales in Europe, Mideast and Africa increased 2% (4% excluding foreign exchange), due to sales growth of products including
PRAVACHOL*, TAXOL*, PLAVIX and AVAPRO. These increases were partialloyf fset by decreases in sales of ostomy supplies and of
CAPOTEN* due to generic competition.
Sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries increased 3% (6% excluding foreign exchange) in 2000 primarily as a result of growth in Canada due
to increased sales of PLAVIX, AVAPRO and ENFAMIL*a, nd in Mexico due to growth of ENFAMIL* and CAL-C-TOSE*. In 1999, sales in
Other Western Hemisphere countries decreased 9% (a 3% increase excluding foreign exchange) primarily resulting from decreases in sales of
CAPOTEN* and PRAVACHOL*, partially offset by growth in ENFAMIL*, AVAPRO and PLAVIX.
Sales in the Pacific region increased 12% in 2000 (11% excluding foreign exchange). Products with strong growth included BUFFERIN*, TAXOL*
and PARAPLATIN* in Japan and nutritional productsi n the Philippines and Thailand. In 1999, Pacific region sales increased 18% (10% excluding
foreign exchange) as a result of increases in BUFFERIN*, TAXOL*a nd PARAPLATIN*. The favorable effect from foreign exchange was
experienced primarily in Japan.
Financial Instruments
Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities totaled almost $3.4 billion at December 31, 2000 compared with $3.0 billion and
$2.5 billion at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Working capital continued to improve with $4.2 billion at December 31, 2000, compared
with $3.7 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities,
in addition to the conversion of other working capital items are expected to fund near-term operations of the Company.
The Company is exposed to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates. To reduce this risk, the Company enters into certain derivative
financial instruments when available on a cost-effective basis to hedge its underlying economic exposure. These instruments also are managed on aconsolidated basis to efficiently net exposures and thus take advantage of any natural offsets. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading
purposes. Gains and losses on hedging transactions are offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
25
Foreign exchange option contracts and, to a lesser extent, forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated transactions. The Company's primary
foreign currency exposures in relation to the US dollar are the euro, Mexican peso, Canadian dollar, Brazilian real and Japanese yen.
The table below summarizes the Company's outstanding foreign exchange option contracts as of December 31, 2000. The fair value of option
contracts, which changes over time, is estimated by using the Black-Scholes model and is based on year-end currency rates. The fair value of option
contracts should be viewed in relation to the fair value of the underlying hedged transactions and the overall reduction in exposure to adverse
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

At December 31, 1999, the Company held right-to-sell option contracts with an aggregate notional amount, carrying value and fair value of $1,621
million, $28 million and $69 million, respectively. These contracts related primarily to option contracts with the right to sell euros, Mexican pesos and
Canadian dollars. Other contracts at December 31, 1999 included right-to-buy option contracts, primarily to buy Japanese yen for US dollars. These
contracts had an aggregate notional amount and fair value of $141 million and $20 million, respectively, and no carrying value.
The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities with various financial institutions. These financial
institutions are located primarily in the US and Europe. Company policy is designed to limit exposure to any one financial institution.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards( SFAS) No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement requires that companies recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities on the balance sheet and measure these instruments at fair value. In June 1999, the FASB issued SFAS No. 137,A ccounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the effective date of FASB Statement No.1 33. This statement deferred the
effective date of SFAS No. 133 to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No.1 38, Accounting for
Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, which made minor amendments to SFAS No. 133. The Company adoptedSFAS No. 133, as amended, on January 1, 2001. The adoption of this accounting requirement will not have a material effect on either the
Company's consolidated financial statements or hedging programs.

Euro Conversion
On January 1, 1999, certain members of the European Union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the European
Union's common currency, known as the euro. It is planned that by July 1, 2002 the participating countries will withdraw all currencies and use the
euro exclusively.
The Company has committed resources to conduct assessments and to take corrective actions to ensure it is prepared for the introduction of the
euro. The Company is actively addressing the many areas involved with the introduction of the euro, including information management, finance, legal
and tax. This review includes the conversion of information technology, business and financial systems; evaluation of currency risk; and the effect on
the Company's financial instruments, as well as the impact on the pricing and distribution of Company products.
The Company believes the effect of introduction of the euro, as well as any related cost of conversion, will not have a material impact on the results of
operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Financial Position
Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities at December 31, 2000 were denominated primarily in US dollar instruments with
near-term maturities. The average interest yield on cash and cash equivalents was 5.9% at December 31, 2000, while interest yields on time deposits
and marketable securities averaged 5.7% at December 31, 2000.
Short-term borrowings and long-term debt at December 31, 2000 are denominated primarily in US dollars but also include Japanese yen long-term
debt of $272 million. During the year the Company reduced short-term borrowings by $247 million primarily as a result of the paydown of the
international commercial paper program.
Internally generated cash provided by operations was $4.7 billion in 2000, $4.2 billion in 1999 and $3.8 billion in 1998. Cash provided by
operations continued to be the Company's primary source of funds to finance operating needs and expenditures for new plants and equipment. As
part of the Company's ongoing commitment to improve plant efficiency and maintain superior research facilities, the Company has invested $2.1
billion in capital expansion over the past three years. Cash flow from operations also included product liability payments, net of insurance recoverable
receipts of $73 million in 2000, $667 million in 1999 and $519 million in 1998.
Cash provided by operations also was used over the past three years to pay dividends of $5.2 billion, to finance $5.3 billion of the Company's share
repurchase program and to fund business acquisitions, including the purchase of patents and trademarks, at a cost of $555 million. The Company's
share repurchase program authorizes the Company to purchase common stock from time to time in the open market or through private transactions
as market conditions permit.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
27
During 2000, the Company purchased 40 million shares of common stock at a cost of $2.3 billion, bringing the total shares acquired since the
program's inception to 340 million. In September 2000, the Company announced a $2 billion increase in the stock repurchase program authorization.
During the past three years, the Company has repurchased 93 million shares at a cost of $5.3 billion.
Employment levels for continuing operations of 44,004 at December 2000 decreased from prior year levels of 45,955. Sales per employee improved
to $414 thousand in 2000 from $367 thousand in 1999 and $324 thousand in 1998.
Return on Stockholders' Equity, excluding nonrecurring items, improved over the last three years and was 48.3% in 2000, 46.7% in 1999 and
43.5% in 1998.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(dollars in millions)
Note 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and all of its subsidiaries.
Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents primarily include securities with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase,
recorded at cost, which approximates market value.
Time Deposits and Marketable Securities - Time deposits and marketable securities are available for sale and are recorded at fair value, which
approximates cost.
Inventory Valuation - Inventories are generally stated at average cost, not in excess of market.
Capital Assets and Depreciation - Expenditures for additions, renewals and betterments are capitalized at cost. Depreciation is generally computed
by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of the major classes of depreciable
assets are 50 years for buildings and 3 to 40 years for machinery, equipment and fixtures.
Excess of Cost over Net Tangible Assets - The excess of cost over net tangible assets received in business acquisitions is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over periods not exceeding 40 years. The excess of cost over net tangible assets is periodically reviewed for impairment based on
an assessment of future operations (including cash flows) to ensure that the excess of cost over net tangible assets is appropriately valued.
Product Liability - Accruals for product liability are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated, based on existing information. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessment efforts
progress or as additional information becomes available. Receivables for related insurance or other third-party recoveries for product liabilities are
recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a recovery will be realized. Insurance recoverable recorded on the balance sheet has, in
general, payment terms of two years or less.
Revenue Recognition - Revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to customers.
Earnings Per Share - Basic earnings per common share are computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per common share are computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, plus the incremental
shares outstanding assuming the exercise of dilutive stock options.
Reclassifications - Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform with current year presentation.

Each share of the Company's preferred stock is convertible into 16.96 shares of common stock and is callable at the Company's option. The
reductions in the number of issued shares of preferred stock in 2000, 1999 and 1998 were due to conversions into shares of common stock.
Dividends per common share were $.98 in 2000, $.86 in 1999 and $.78 in 1998.
Stock Compensation Plans
Under the Company's 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, officers, directors and key employees may be granted options to purchase the Company's
common stock at no less than 100% of the market price on the date the option is granted. Options generally become exercisable in installments of
25% per year on each of the first through the fourth anniversaries of the grant date and have a maximum term of 10 years. Additionally, the plan
provides for the granting of stock appreciation rights whereby the grantee may surrender exercisable options and receive common stock and/or cash
measured by the excess of the market price of the common stock over the option exercise price. The plan also provides for the granting of
performance-based stock options to certain key executives.
Under the terms of the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, additional shares are authorized in the amount of 0.9% of the outstanding shares per
year through 2002. The plan incorporates the Company's long-term performance awards.
In addition, the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the granting of up to 20,000,000 shares of common stock to key employees, subject to
restrictions as to continuous employment except in the case of death or normal retirement. Restrictions generally expire over a five-year period from
date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized over the restricted period. At December 31, 2000, a total of 1,821,194 restricted shares were
outstanding under the plan.
Under the TeamShare Stock Option Plan, all full-time employees, excluding key executives, meeting certain years of service requirements are granted
options to purchase the Company's common stock at the market price on the date the options are granted. The Company has authorized 62,000,000
shares for issuance under the plan. As of December 31, 2000, a total of 28,455,134 shares have been exercised under the plan.
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in
accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized for its stock-based compensation plans other than for restricted
stock and performance-based awards. Had compensation cost for the Company's other stock option plans been determined based upon the fair
value at the grant date for awards under these plans consistent with the methodology prescribed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company's net income and earnings per share would have been reduced by
approximately $218 million, or $.11 per common share, basic and diluted, in 2000, $198 million, or $.10 per common share, basic and diluted, in
1999 and $136 million, or $.07 per common share, basic and diluted, in 1998. The fair value of the options granted during 2000, 1999 and 1998
was estimated as $17.17 per common share, $17.37 per common share and $11.80 per common share, respectively, on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

Note 12 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Foreign exchange option contracts and, to a lesser extent, forward contracts, are used to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily
intercompany inventory purchases expected to occur within the next year.
The Company has exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, which approximated $1,781 million, $2,179 million and
$2,310 million at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, primarily in Europe, Japan and Mexico. The Company mitigates the effect of
these exposures through third-party borrowings. The exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities related to discontinued
operations and included in the above amounts are not material.
The risk of loss associated with the types of foreign exchange option contracts entered into by the Company is limited to premium amounts paid for
the option contracts. Premiums are deferred in Prepaid Expenses and amortized in the consolidated statement of earnings (in the Other caption) over
the time frame of the underlying hedged transaction. Gains related to the option contracts, which qualify as hedges of foreign currency anticipated
transactions, are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions are recognized. Gains and losses on foreign exchange forward contracts are
recognized in the basis of the underlying transaction being hedged.
The notional amounts of the Company's foreign exchange option contracts at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $1,395 million, $1,762
million and $1,307 million, respectively. The notional amounts of foreign exchange contracts related to discontinued operations and included in the

The Company's share of the components of total net pension expense and pension assets and obligation, related to continuing operations as well as
any curtailment gain or loss, has not yet been determined, and therefore the following information relates to the Company's pension plan including
discontinued operations. The amounts related to discontinued operations are estimated to represent approximately 10% of total pension obligations
and assets of the Company's retirement plans.

Note 17 LITIGATION
Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings of a nature considered normal to its businesses are pending against the Company and certain of its
subsidiaries. The most significant of these are described below.
Breast Implant
The Company, together with its subsidiary, Medical Engineering Corporation (MEC), and certain other companies, has been named as a defendant in
a number of claims and lawsuits alleging damages for personal injuries of various types resulting from polyurethane-covered breast implants and
smooth-walled breast implants formerly manufactured by MEC or a related company. Of the more than 90,000 claims or potential claims against the
Company in direct lawsuits or through registration in the nationwide class action settlement approved by the Federal District Court in Birmingham,
Alabama (the "Revised Settlement"), most have been dealt with through the Revised Settlement, other settlements, or trial. As of December 31,
2000, the Company's contingent liability in respect of breast implant claims was limited to residual unpaid Revised Settlement obligations and to
roughly 850 remaining opt-outs who have pursued or may pursue their claims in court.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________50
BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(dollars in millions)
As of December 31, 2000, approximately 4,790 US and 310 foreign breast implant recipients were plaintiffs in lawsuits pending in federal and state
courts in the United States and certain courts in Canada and Australia. These figures include the claims of plaintiffs that are in the process of being
settled and/or dismissed. In these lawsuits, about 2,140 US and 68 foreign plaintiffs opted out of the Revised Settlement. Thel awsuits of the 2,650
US plaintiffs who did not opt out are expected to be dismissed since these plaintiffs are among the estimated 74,000 women with MEC implants who
chose to participate in the nationwide settlement. Of the 2,140 opt-out plaintiffs, an estimated 1,290 have claims based upon products that were not
manufactured or sold by MEC or that have been or are in the process of being settled and/or dismissed. Accordingly, the number of remaining
plaintiffs who have pursued or may pursue their claims in court against the Company is roughly 850, as stated in the preceding paragraph.
Under the terms of the Revised Settlement, additional opt-outs are expected to be minimal since the deadline for US class members to opt out has
passed. In addition, the Company's remaining obligations under the Revised Settlement Program are limited because most payments to "Current
Claimants" have already been made, no additional "Current Claims" may be filed without court approval, and because payments of claims to so-
called "Other Registrants" and "Late Registrants" are limited by the terms of the Revised Settlement. Separate class action settlements have been
approved in the provincial courts of Ontario and Quebec, and an agreement has been reached under which other foreign breast implant recipients
may settle their claims. The Company believes it will be able to address remaining opt-out claims as well as expected remaining obligations under the
Revised Settlement program within its reserves described below.
In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recorded a charge of $500 million before taxes ($310 million after taxes) in respect of breast implant
cases. The charge consisted of $1.5 billion for potential liabilities and expenses, offset by $1.0 billion of expected insurance proceeds. In the fourth
quarters of 1994 and 1995, the Company recorded additional special charges of $750 million before taxes ($488 million after taxes) and $950
million before taxes ($590 million after taxes), respectively, related to breast implant product liability claims. In the fourth quarter of 1998, the
Company recorded an additional special charge to earnings in the amount of $800 million before taxes and increased its insurance receivable in the
amount of $100 million, resulting in a net charge to earnings of $433 million after taxes in respect of breast implant product liability claims. During
2000, 1999 and 1998, cash payments, net of insurance receipts, of $68 million, $631 million and $551 million, respectively, were made related to the
breast implant product liability claims. At December 31, 2000, $186 million was included in current liabilities for breast implant product liability
claims.
TAXOL*
In 1997 and 1998, the Company filed several lawsuits alleging that a number of generic drug companies infringed its patents covering methods of
administering paclitaxel when they filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking regulatory approval to sell paclitaxel. These actions were
consolidated for discovery in the US District Court for the District ofN ew Jersey. The Company does not assert a monetary claim against any of the
defendants, but seeks to prevent the defendants from marketing paclitaxel in a manner that violates the Company's patents.
The defendants have asserted that they do not infringe the Company's patents and that these patents are invalid and unenforceable. Some defendants
also asserted counterclaims seeking damages for alleged antitrust and unfair competition violations. The Company believes its patents are valid and
the counterclaims asserted are without merit.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(dollars in millions)
On January 4, 2000, the District Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss certain of the antitrust and unfair competition counterclaims. The
Company's motion for summary judgment on the remaining antitrust and unfair competition counterclaims was denied on March 17, 2000. On
February 29, 2000, the District Court granted in part the generic companies' summary judgment motions for invalidity by finding all claims of the
Company's patents invalid, except for claims limited to the treatment of ovarian cancer. The District Court's opinion left for determination at trial the
validity of the claims of the Company's patents directed to the low dose, three-hour administration of paclitaxel for ovarian cancer and denied the
generic companies' summary judgment motion arguing non-infringement of the Company's patents.
In order to pursue an immediate appellate review of the District Court's invalidity findings, the Company voluntarily relinquished all rights in the
remaining ovarian tumor-specific claims of its patents.
On April 7, 2000, the District Court granted the Company's request for an entry of judgment. The Company's appeal of the District Court's judgment
is pending before the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. If the Company is successful on appeal and the trial that would follow a successful appeal,
the Company believes its remaining patent rights would apply to all tumor types.
In September 2000, one of the defendants received final approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for its Abbreviated New Drug
Application for paclitaxel and is marketing the product. Two additional tentative approvals have been announced by the United States Food andDrug Administration. One has been issued to a company in the same corporate family as the defendant that received final approval. The other
tentative approval was issued to an unrelated defendant.
It is not possible at this time to make a reasonable assessment of the outcome of the appeal and the remaining claims in these actions or to reasonably
estimate the impact on TAXOL* sales or the amount of damages were the Company not to prevail.
VANLEV*
The Company, its Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Charles A. Heimbold, Jr., and its Chief ScientificO fficer and President -
Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Peter S. Ringrose,P h.D., are defendants in a number of purported class actions filed in the US District Court for
the District of New Jersey in April, May and June allegingv iolations of federal securities laws and regulations. Plaintiffs claim that the defendants
disseminated materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose information concerning the safety and expected availability of its product
Vanlev during the period November 8, 1999 through April 19, 2000. Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and costs and expenses.
It is not possible at this time to make a reasonable assessment of the outcome of this matter or the amount of damages were the Company not to
prevail.
While it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these cases, it is the opinion of management that they will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's operating results or consolidated financial position.

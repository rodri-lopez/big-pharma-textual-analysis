Item 1. BUSINESS.
General
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in August 1933 under the name Bristol-Myers Company, as successor to a
New York business started in 1887. In 1989, Bristol-Myers Company changed its name to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company as a result of a merger. We are engaged in
the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of biopharmaceutical products on a global basis. Refer to the Summary of
Abbreviated Terms at the end of this 2016 Form 10-K for terms used throughout the document.
We operate in one segment—BioPharmaceuticals. For additional information about business segments, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 2. Business
Segment Information.”
We compete with other worldwide research-based drug companies, smaller research companies and generic drug manufacturers. Our products are sold worldwide,
primarily to wholesalers, retail pharmacies, hospitals, government entities and the medical profession. We manufacture products in the U.S., Puerto Rico and in five
foreign countries. Most of our revenues come from products in the following therapeutic classes: oncology; cardiovascular; immunoscience; and virology, including
HIV infection.
The percentage of revenues by significant region/country were as follows:
Year Ended December 31,
Dollars in Millions 2016 2015 2014
United States 55% 49% 49%
Europe 22% 21% 23%
Japan 7% 10% 6%
Other 16% 20% 22%
Total Revenues $ 19,427 $ 16,560 $ 15,879
Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions in the last five years include Cormorant and Padlock in 2016, Cardioxyl and Flexus in 2015, iPierian in 2014 and Amylin and Inhibitex in 2012 and we also
entered into several license and other collaboration arrangements. Divestitures in the last five years include certain OTC products and investigational HIV medicines
businesses in 2016, Erbitux* in North America and certain mature and other OTC product businesses in 2015 and our diabetes business in 2014. These transactions
continue to allow us to focus our resources behind growth opportunities which drive the greatest long-term value.
Products, Intellectual Property and Product Exclusivity
Our pharmaceutical products include chemically-synthesized drugs, or small molecules, and products produced from biological processes, called “biologics.” Small
molecule drugs are typically administered orally, e.g., in the form of a pill or tablet, although other drug delivery mechanisms are used as well. Biologics are typically
administered to patients through injections or by intravenous infusion.
Below is a product summary including approved indications. For information about our alliance arrangements for the products below, refer to “—Alliances" below

Truvada* (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate).
We own or license a number of patents in the U.S. and foreign countries primarily covering our products. We have also developed many brand names and trademarks
for our products. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks, licenses and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to
protect these rights from infringement.
In the pharmaceutical industry, the majority of an innovative product’s commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market
exclusivity. A product’s market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: patent rights held by the innovator company and any
regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovative drug is entitled.
Patents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing
an invention related to the medicine. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses of a drug product, pharmaceutical formulations,
drug delivery mechanisms and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods
in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the
type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.
Market exclusivity is also sometimes influenced by regulatory intellectual property rights. Many developed countries provide certain non-patent incentives for the
development of medicines. For example, in the U.S., the EU, Japan, and certain other countries, regulatory intellectual property rights are offered as incentives for
research on medicines for rare diseases, or orphan drugs, and on medicines useful in treating pediatric patients. These incentives can extend the market exclusivity
period on a product beyond the patent term.
The U.S., EU and Japan also each provide for a minimum period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the
innovator’s data to approve a competitor’s generic copy, or data protection. In some regions such as China, however, it is questionable whether such data protection
laws are enforceable. In certain markets where patent protection and other forms of market exclusivity may have expired, data protection can be of particular
importance. However, most regulatory forms of exclusivity do not prevent a competitor from gaining regulatory approval prior to the expiration of regulatory data
exclusivity on the basis of the competitor’s own safety and efficacy data on its drug, even when that drug is identical to that marketed by the innovator.
Specific aspects of the law governing market exclusivity and data protection for pharmaceuticals vary from country to country. The following summarizes key
exclusivity rules in markets representing significant sales:
United States
In the U.S., most of our key products are protected by patents with varying terms depending on the type of patent and the filing date. A significant portion of a
product’s patent life, however, is lost during the time it takes an innovative company to develop and obtain regulatory approval of a new drug. As compensation at
least in part for the lost patent term, the innovator may, depending on a number of factors, extend the expiration date of one patent up to a maximum term of five years,
provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 14 years from the date of drug approval.
4A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the U.S. must submit a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the FDA. If the innovative
pharmaceutical is a chemical, the company files an NDA. If the medicine is a biological product, a BLA is filed. The type of application filed affects regulatory
exclusivity rights.
Chemical products
A competitor seeking to launch a generic substitute of a chemical innovative drug in the U.S. must file an aNDA with the FDA. In the aNDA, the generic
manufacturer needs to demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic substitute and the approved NDA drug. The aNDA relies upon the safety and
efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its NDA.
An innovator company is required to list certain of its patents covering the medicine with the FDA in what is commonly known as the Orange Book. Absent a
successful patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an aNDA until after the innovator’s listed patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its
product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an aNDA and allege that one or more of the patents listed in the Orange Book under an innovator’s NDA is
either invalid or not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a Paragraph IV certification. The innovator then must decide whether to file a patent
infringement suit against the generic manufacturer. From time to time, aNDAs, including Paragraph IV certifications, are filed with respect to certain of our products.
We evaluate these aNDAs on a case-by-case basis and, where warranted, file suit against the generic manufacturer to protect our patent rights.
In addition to benefiting from patent protection, certain innovative pharmaceutical products can receive periods of regulatory exclusivity. An NDA that is designated
as an orphan drug can receive seven years of exclusivity for the orphan indication. During this time period, neither NDAs nor aNDAs for the same drug product can
be approved for the same orphan use. A company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical trials are conducted at the
written request of the FDA to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients, and submission to the FDA is made prior to the loss of basic exclusivity.
Medicines approved under an NDA can also receive several types of regulatory data protection. An innovative chemical pharmaceutical is entitled to five years of
regulatory data protection in the U.S., during which competitors cannot file with the FDA for approval of generic substitutes. If an innovator’s patent is challenged,
as described above, a generic manufacturer may file its aNDA after the fourth year of the five-year data protection period. A pharmaceutical drug product that
contains an active ingredient that has been previously approved in an NDA, but is approved in a new formulation, but not for the drug itself, or for a new indication
on the basis of new clinical trials, receives three years of data protection for that formulation or indication.
Biologic products
The U.S. healthcare legislation enacted in 2010 created an approval pathway for biosimilar versions of innovative biological products that did not previously exist.
Prior to that time, innovative biologics had essentially unlimited regulatory exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are
similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its
product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a “biosimilar” version of the innovator product. However, although an application for
approval of a biosimilar may be filed four years after approval of the innovator product, qualified innovative biological products will receive 12 years of regulatory
exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law
also provides a mechanism for innovators to enforce the patents that protect innovative biological products and for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents.
Such patent litigation may begin as early as four years after the innovative biological product is first approved by the FDA.
In the U.S., the increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators’ intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators’ market
exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators’ basic patents covering major pharmaceutical products. Second, statutory and
regulatory provisions in the U.S. limit the ability of an innovator company to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent
litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based
solely on the expiration of the relevant patent(s) or the current forms of regulatory exclusivity.
European Union
Patents on pharmaceutical products are generally enforceable in the EU and, as in the U.S., may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the
regulatory review process. Such extensions are granted on a country-by-country basis.
5The primary route we use to obtain marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products in the EU is through the “centralized procedure.” This procedure is
compulsory for certain pharmaceutical products, in particular those using biotechnological processes, and is also available for certain new chemical compounds and
products. A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy
data as part of an MAA with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the EC and the EC then approves or denies the MAA. It
is also possible for new chemical products to obtain marketing authorization in the EU through a “mutual recognition procedure,” in which an application is made to a
single member state, and if the member state approves the pharmaceutical product under a national procedure, then the applicant may submit that approval to the
mutual recognition procedure of some or all other member states.
After obtaining marketing authorization approval, a company must obtain pricing and reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to
member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be
completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete.
Throughout the EU, all products for which marketing authorizations have been filed after October/November 2005 are subject to an “8+2+1” regime. Eight years after
the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a marketing authorization application for that product
with the health authorities. If the marketing authorization application is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11
years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator. The possible extension to 11 years is available if the innovator, during the first
eight years of the marketing authorization, obtains an additional indication that is of significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing treatments. For products
that were filed prior to October/November 2005, there is a 10-year period of data protection under the centralized procedures and a period of either six or 10 years
under the mutual recognition procedure (depending on the member state).
In contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities. Generic versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after data protection
expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a
generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may
challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant.
In general, EU law treats chemically-synthesized drugs and biologically-derived drugs the same with respect to intellectual property and data protection. In addition
to the relevant legislation and annexes related to biologic medicinal products, the EMA has issued guidelines that outline the additional information to be provided
for biosimilar products, also known as generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing approval.
Japan
In Japan, medicines of new chemical entities are generally afforded eight years of data exclusivity for approved indications and dosage. Patents on pharmaceutical
products are enforceable. Generic copies can receive regulatory approval after data exclusivity and patent expirations. As in the U.S., patents in Japan may be
extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process.
In general, Japanese law treats chemically-synthesized and biologically-derived drugs the same with respect to intellectual property and market exclusivity.
Rest of the World
In countries outside of the U.S., the EU and Japan, there is a wide variety of legal systems with respect to intellectual property and market exclusivity of
pharmaceuticals. Most other developed countries utilize systems similar to either the U.S. or the EU. Among developing countries, some have adopted patent laws
and/or regulatory exclusivity laws, while others have not. Some developing countries have formally adopted laws in order to comply with WTO commitments, but
have not taken steps to implement these laws in a meaningful way. Enforcement of WTO actions is a long process between governments, and there is no assurance
of the outcome. Thus, in assessing the likely future market exclusivity of our innovative drugs in developing countries, we take into account not only formal legal
rights but political and other factors as well.
In the U.S., the EU and some other countries, when these patent rights and other forms of exclusivity expire and generic versions of a medicine are approved and
marketed, there are often substantial and rapid declines in the sales of the original innovative product. For further discussion of patent rights and regulatory forms of
exclusivity, refer to “—Intellectual Property and Product Exclusivity” below. For further discussion of the impact of generic competition on our business, refer to
“—Generic Competition” below.
6The following chart shows our key products together with the year in which the earliest basic exclusivity loss (patent rights or data exclusivity) occurred or is
currently estimated to occur in the U.S., the EU and Japan. We also sell our pharmaceutical products in other countries; however, data is not provided on a country-
by-country basis because individual country revenues are not significant outside the U.S., the EU and Japan. In many instances, the basic exclusivity loss date listed
below is the expiration date of the patent that claims the active ingredient of the drug or the method of using the drug for the approved indication, if there is only one
approved indication. In some instances, the basic exclusivity loss date listed in the chart is the expiration date of the data exclusivity period. In situations where there
is only data exclusivity without patent protection, a competitor could seek regulatory approval by submitting its own clinical trial data to obtain marketing approval
prior to the expiration of data exclusivity.
We estimate the market exclusivity period for each of our products for the purpose of business planning only. The length of market exclusivity for any of our
products is impossible to predict with certainty because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity and the inherent uncertainties
regarding patent litigation. There can be no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that appears in the estimate or
that the exclusivity will be limited to the estimate.

Note: The currently estimated earliest year of basic exclusivity loss includes any statutory extensions of exclusivity that have been granted. In some instances, we may be able to obtain an
additional six months exclusivity for a product based on the pediatric extension. In certain other instances, there may be later-expiring patents that cover particular forms or compositions of
the drug, as well as methods of manufacturing or methods of using the drug. Such patents may sometimes result in a favorable market position for our products, but product exclusivity cannot
be predicted or assured. Under the U.S. healthcare law enacted in 2010, qualifying biologic products will receive 12 years of data exclusivity before a biosimilar can enter the market, as
described in more detail in “—Intellectual Property and Product Exclusivity” below.
++ We do not currently market the product in the country or region indicated.
^^ In May 2013, Apotex Inc., Actavis Group PTC ehf, Generics [UK] Limited (Mylan) and an unnamed company filed oppositions in the EPO seeking revocation of European Patent No.
1169038 (the '038 patent) covering dasatinib, the active ingredient in Sprycel. The ‘038 patent is scheduled to expire in April 2020 (excluding potential term extensions). On January
20, 2016, the Opposition Division of the EPO revoked the ‘038 patent. In May 2016, the Company appealed the EPO’s decision to the EPO Board of Appeal and in February 2017,
the EPO Board of Appeal upheld the Opposition’s decision, and the ‘038 patent has been revoked. We may experience a decline in European revenues in the second half of 2017 due to
the unfavorable the EPO Board of Appeal's decision. The EPO Board of Appeal’s decision does not affect the validity of our other Sprycel patents, including different patents that cover
the monohydrate form of dasatinib and the use of dasatinib to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Additionally, in February 2017, the EPO Board of Appeal reversed and
remanded an invalidity decision on European Patent No. 1610780 and its claim to the use of dasatinib to treat CML, which the EPO’s Opposition Division had revoked in October
2012. We intend to pursue legal options to defend our intellectual property rights from any future infringement. Refer to “Note 18. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies” for more
information.
(a) References to the EU throughout this Form 10-K include all member states of the EU during the year ended December 31, 2016. Basic patent applications have not been filed in all
current member states for all of the listed products. In some instances, the date of basic exclusivity loss will be different in various EU member states. For those EU countries where the
basic patent was not obtained, there may be data protection available.
(b) Empliciti: We have a commercialization agreement with AbbVie for Empliciti. For more information about our arrangement with AbbVie, refer to “—Alliances” below and “Item 8.
Financial Statements—Note 3. Alliances.” AbbVie owns a composition of matter patent covering elotuzumab that expires in 2026 in the U.S. (excluding potential patent term
extension) and 2024 in the EU and Japan (excluding potential patent term extensions). Exclusivity period in Europe and Japan is based on regulatory data protection.
(c) Opdivo: We jointly own a patent with Ono covering nivolumab as a composition of matter that expires in 2027 in the U.S. (excluding potential patent term extensions) and 2026 in the
EU (excluding potential patent term extensions). The composition of matter patent covering nivolumab in Japan expires in 2031 including the granted patent term extension.
(d) Sprycel: A patent term extension has been granted in the U.S. extending the term on the basic composition of matter patent covering dasatinib until June 2020. In 2013, the Company
entered into a settlement agreement with Apotex regarding a patent infringement suit covering the monohydrate form of dasatinib whereby Apotex can launch its generic dasatinib
monohydrate aNDA product in September 2024, or earlier in certain circumstances.
(e) Yervoy U.S.: Exclusivity period is based on the composition of matter patent that expires in 2025 including the granted patent term extensions. Data exclusivity expires in the U.S. in
2023. We own a patent covering ipilimumab as a composition of matter that currently expires in 2022 in the U.S. (excluding potential patent term extension).
(f) Yervoy EU: Exclusivity period is based on regulatory data protection. Data exclusivity expires in the EU in 2021. We own a patent covering ipilimumab as a composition of matter that
currently expires in 2020 in the EU (excluding potential patent term extensions). The patent term extension has been granted in many European countries and in those countries, the
composition of matter patent expires in 2025.
(g) Yervoy Japan: Exclusivity period is based on the composition of matter patent that expires in 2025, including the granted patent term extension.
7(h) Eliquis U.S.: The composition of matter patent covering apixaban in the U.S. expires in February 2023 and a request for a patent term restoration extension until 2026 is pending (does
not include a potential six month pediatric exclusivity extension, which if granted would provide protection until 2027).
(i) Eliquis EU and Japan: The composition of matter patent covering apixaban in the EU expires in 2022. We have applied for supplementary protection certificates.The supplementary
protection certificates in most European countries have been granted and expire in 2026. Data exclusivity in the EU expires in 2021. The composition of matter patent covering
apixaban in Japan expires in 2026 including the granted patent term extension.
(j) Orencia U.S.: We have a series of patents covering abatacept and its method of use. In the U.S., a patent term extension has been granted for one of the composition of matter patents,
extending the term of the U.S. patent to 2019. Data exclusivity expires in the U.S. in December 2017 and the method of use patent expires in 2021.
(k) Orencia EU: In the EU, the composition of matter patent covering abatacept expired in 2012. In the majority of the EU countries, we have applied for supplementary protection
certificates and also pediatric extension of the supplementary protection certificates for protection until December 2017. The supplemental protection certificates in most European
countries have been granted. Data exclusivity expires in the EU in May 2017 and the method of use patent expires in 2021.
(l) Orencia Japan: Exclusivity period is based on regulatory data protection, which expires in 2018.

U.S. expired in 2013 and the method of use patent for the treatment of HIV infection expired in September 2014. Pediatric exclusivity has been granted, which provides an additional six
month period of exclusivity added to the term of the patents listed in the Orange Book. In October 2014, the Company announced that it has successfully resolved all outstanding U.S.
patent litigation relating to efavirenz and that loss of exclusivity in the U.S. for efavirenz is not expected to occur until December 2017. The joint venture agreement with Gilead to
commercialize Atripla* may be terminated upon the launch of a generic version of Sustiva.
(r) Sustiva EU: Exclusivity period relates to the Sustiva brand and does not include exclusivity related to any combination therapy. Market exclusivity for Sustiva expired in November
2013 in countries in the EU. Data exclusivity for Sustiva expired in the EU in 2009.
Research and Development
R&D is critical to our long-term competitiveness. We have major R&D sites throughout the world. As part of our operating model evolution the geographic footprint
will significantly transform to foster speed and innovation in the future. The transformation involves the closing of several existing R&D sites accompanied by
increased investment in the expansion of others, specifically in the U.S. We supplement our internal drug discovery and development programs with alliances and
collaborative agreements which help us bring new molecular agents, capabilities and platforms into our pipeline. Management continues to emphasize leadership,
innovation, productivity and quality as strategies for success in our R&D activities.
We concentrate our R&D efforts in the following disease areas with significant unmet medical needs: oncology, including IO, immunoscience, cardiovascular, fibrotic
disease and GDD. We also continue to analyze and may selectively pursue promising leads in other areas. In addition to discovering and developing new molecular
entities, we look for ways to expand the value of existing products through new indications and formulations that can provide additional benefits to patients.
In order for a new drug to reach the market, industry practice and government regulations in the U.S., the EU and most foreign countries provide for the determination
of a drug’s effectiveness and safety through preclinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation. The clinical development of a potential new drug includes Phase I,
Phase II and Phase III clinical trials that have been designed specifically to support a new drug application for a particular indication, assuming the trials are
successful.
Phase I clinical trials involve a small number of healthy volunteers or patients suffering from the indicated disease to test for safety and proper dosing. Phase II
clinical trials involve a larger patient population to investigate side effects, efficacy, and optimal dosage of the drug candidate. Phase III clinical trials are conducted
to confirm Phase II results in a significantly larger patient population over a longer term and to provide reliable and conclusive data regarding the safety and efficacy
of a drug candidate. Although regulatory approval is typically based on the results of Phase III clinical trials, there are times when approval can be granted based on
data from earlier trials.
We consider our R&D programs in Phase III to be our significant R&D programs. These programs include both investigational compounds in Phase III development
for initial indications and marketed products that are in Phase III development for additional indications or formulations.
Drug development is time consuming, expensive and risky. The R&D process typically takes about fourteen years, with approximately two and a half years often
spent in Phase III, or late-stage, development. On average, only about one in 10,000 chemical compounds discovered by pharmaceutical industry researchers proves
to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and even late-stage product
candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval. According to the KMR Group, based on industry success rates from 2011-2015, approximately 90% of the
compounds that enter Phase I development fail to achieve regulatory approval. The failure rate for compounds that enter Phase II development is approximately 77%
and for compounds that enter Phase III development, it is approximately 29%.
Total R&D expenses include the costs of discovery research, preclinical development, early- and late-stage clinical development and drug formulation, as well as
post-commercialization and medical support of marketed products, proportionate allocations of enterprise-wide costs and licensing and acquiring assets. R&D
expenses were $4.9 billion in 2016, $5.9 billion in 2015 and $4.5 billion in 2014 including license and asset acquisition charges of approximately $440 million, $1.7 billion
and $280 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014,
8respectively. At the end of 2016, we employed approximately 8,400 people in R&D and related support activities, including a substantial number of physicians,
scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and higher-skilled technical personnel.
We manage our R&D programs on a portfolio basis, investing resources in each stage of R&D from early discovery through late-stage development. We continually
evaluate our portfolio of R&D assets to ensure that there is an appropriate balance of early-stage and late-stage programs to support the future growth of the
Company. Spending on our late-stage development programs represented approximately 30-45% of our annual R&D expenses in the last three years. No individual
investigational compound or marketed product represented 10% or more of our R&D expenses in any of the last three years, except Opdivo in both 2016 and 2015.
Listed below are our investigational compounds that we have in clinical trials as well as the approved and potential indications for our marketed products in the
related therapeutic area as of January 1, 2017. Whether any of the listed compounds ultimately becomes a marketed product depends on the results of clinical studies,
the competitive landscape of the potential product’s market, reimbursement decisions by payers and the manufacturing processes necessary to produce the potential
product on a commercial scale, among other factors. There can be no assurance that we will seek regulatory approval of any of these compounds or that, if such
approval is sought, it will be obtained. There is also no assurance that a compound which gets approved will be commercially successful. At this stage of
development, we cannot determine all intellectual property issues or all the patent protection that may, or may not, be available for these investigational compounds.
9As of January 10, 2017, the following potential registrational trial readouts for Opdivo are anticipated through 2018:

10Alliances
We enter into alliances with third parties that transfer rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products that are owned by other parties.
These alliances include licensing arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements, co-promotion arrangements and joint ventures. When such alliances
involve sharing research and development costs, the risk of incurring all research and development expenses for compounds that do not lead to revenue-generating
products is reduced. However, profitability on alliance products is generally lower because profits from alliance products are shared with our alliance partners. We
actively pursue such arrangements and view alliances as an important complement to our own discovery, development and commercialization activities.
Each of our alliances with third parties who own the rights to manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products contain customary early termination provisions
typically found in agreements of this kind and are generally based on the material breach of the agreement by a party, or bankruptcy (voluntary or involuntary) of a
party or product safety concerns. The amount of notice required for early termination generally ranges from immediately upon notice to 180 days after receipt of
notice. Termination immediately upon notice is generally available where the other party files a voluntary bankruptcy petition or if a material safety issue arises with a
product such that the medical risk/benefit is incompatible with the welfare of patients to continue to develop or commercialize the product. Termination with a notice
period is generally available where an involuntary bankruptcy petition has been filed (and has not been dismissed) or a material breach by a party has occurred (and
not been cured). Most of our alliance agreements also permit us to terminate without cause, which is typically exercisable with substantial advance written notice and
is sometimes exercisable only after a specified period of time has elapsed after the alliance agreement is signed. Our alliances typically do not otherwise contain
provisions that provide the other party the right to terminate the alliance.
In general, we do not retain any rights to a product brought to an alliance by another party or to the other party’s intellectual property after an alliance terminates.
The loss of rights to one or more products that are marketed and sold by us pursuant to an alliance could be material to our results of operations and cash flows
could be material to our financial condition and liquidity. As is customary in the pharmaceutical industry, the terms of our alliances generally are co-extensive with the
exclusivity period and may vary on a country-by-country basis.
Our most significant alliances for both currently marketed products and investigational compounds are described below. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note
3. Alliances” for additional information on these alliance agreements as well as other alliance agreements.
Pfizer
The Company and Pfizer are parties to a worldwide co-development and co-commercialization agreement for Eliquis. Pfizer funds between 50% and 60% of all
development costs depending on the study. The companies share commercialization expenses and profits and losses equally on a global basis except in certain
countries where Pfizer commercializes Eliquis and pays BMS compensation based on a percentage of net sales.
Gilead
We have joint ventures with Gilead to develop and commercialize Atripla* in the U.S., Canada and in Europe. The Company and Gilead share responsibility for
certain activities related to the commercialization of Atripla* in the U.S., Canada, throughout the EU and certain other European countries. Gilead recognizes 100% of
Atripla* revenues in the U.S., Canada and most countries in Europe. Alliance revenue recognized for Atripla* include only the bulk efavirenz component of Atripla*
which is calculated differently in the EU and the U.S. following the loss of exclusivity of Sustiva in the EU in 2013. Alliance revenue is deferred and the related alliance
receivable is not recognized until Atripla* is sold to third-party customers.
In the U.S., the agreement may be terminated by Gilead upon the launch of a generic version of Sustiva or by BMS upon the launch of a generic version of Truvada*
or its individual components. The loss of exclusivity in the U.S. for Sustiva is expected in December 2017.
Otsuka
BMS and Otsuka have an alliance for Sprycel in the U.S., Japan and the EU (the Oncology Territory). In February 2015, the co-promotion agreement with Otsuka was
terminated in Japan. A fee is paid to Otsuka based on the combined annual net sales of Sprycel and Ixempra* in the Oncology Territory. We also maintain a
commercialization agreement with Otsuka to co-develop and co-promote Abilify* in a limited number of countries outside of the U.S.
Ono
BMS is the principal in the end customer product sales and has the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize Opdivo in all territories worldwide
except Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Ono is entitled to receive royalties following regulatory approvals in all territories excluding the three countries listed above.
Royalty rates on net sales are 4% in North America and 15% in all other applicable territories, subject to customary adjustments.
11The alliance arrangement also includes collaboration activities in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan pertaining to Opdivo, Yervoy and several BMS investigational
compounds. Both parties have the right and obligation to jointly develop and commercialize the compounds. BMS is responsible for supply of the products. Profits,
losses and development costs are shared equally for all combination therapies involving compounds of both parties. Otherwise, sharing is 80% and 20% for activities
involving only one of the party’s compounds.
BMS and Ono also have an alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize Orencia in Japan. BMS is responsible for the order fulfillment and distribution of the
intravenous formulation and Ono is responsible for the subcutaneous formulation. Both formulations are jointly promoted by both parties with assigned customer
accounts and BMS is responsible for the product supply. A co-promotion fee of 60% is paid to the other party when a sale is made to that other party’s assigned
customer.
AbbVie
BMS and AbbVie have an alliance for Empliciti. Under the terms of the alliance, BMS was granted exclusive global rights to co-develop and commercialize Empliciti
from PDL BioPharma, Inc. (now part of AbbVie). Both parties are co-developing the product and AbbVie funds 20% of global development costs. BMS is solely
responsible for supply, distribution and sales and marketing activities within the alliance and is the principal in the end customer product sales. AbbVie shares 30%
of all profits and losses in the U.S. and is paid tiered royalties on net sales of Empliciti outside of the U.S. In addition, AbbVie is entitled to receive milestone
payments from BMS if certain regulatory events and sales thresholds are achieved.
Other Licensing Arrangements
In addition to the alliances described above, we have other in-licensing and out-licensing arrangements. With respect to in-licenses, we have agreements with
Novartis for Reyataz and with Merck for efavirenz, among others. We also own certain compounds out-licensed to third parties for development and
commercialization, including those obtained from our acquisitions. We are entitled to receive milestone payments as these compounds move through the regulatory
process and royalties based on net product sales, if and when the products are commercialized.
Marketing, Distribution and Customers
We promote the appropriate use of our products directly to healthcare professionals and providers such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants,
pharmacists, technologists, hospitals, PBMs and MCOs. We also provide information about the appropriate use of our products to consumers in the U.S. through
direct-to-consumer print, radio, television and digital advertising and promotion. In addition, we sponsor general advertising to educate the public about our
innovative medical research and corporate mission. For a discussion of the regulation of promotion and marketing of pharmaceuticals, refer to “—Government
Regulation” below.
Through our field sales and medical organizations, we explain the risks and benefits of the approved uses of our products to medical professionals. We work to gain
access for our products on formularies and reimbursement plans (lists of recommended or approved medicines and other products), including Medicare Part D plans,
by providing information about the clinical profiles of our products. Our marketing and sales of prescription pharmaceuticals is limited to the approved uses of the
particular product, but we continue to develop scientific data and other information about potential additional uses of our products and provide such information in
response to unsolicited inquiries from doctors, other medical professionals and MCOs.
Our operations include several marketing and sales organizations. Each product marketing organization is supported by a sales force, which may be responsible for
selling one or more products. We also have marketing organizations that focus on certain classes of customers such as managed care entities or certain types of
marketing tools, such as digital or consumer communications. Our sales forces focus on communicating information about new products or new uses, as well as
established products, and promotion to physicians is increasingly targeted at physician specialists who treat the patients in need of our medicines.
Our products are sold principally to wholesalers, and to a lesser extent, directly to distributors, retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies.
Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 2. Business Segment Information” for gross revenues to the three largest pharmaceutical wholesalers in the U.S. as a
percentage of our global gross revenues.
Our U.S. business has IMAs with substantially all of our direct wholesaler and distributor customers that allow us to monitor U.S. wholesaler inventory levels and
requires those wholesalers and distributors to maintain inventory levels that are no more than one month of their demand. The IMAs, including those with our three
largest wholesalers, expire in December 2017 subject to certain termination provisions.
Our non-U.S. businesses have significantly more direct customers. Information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-
movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information varies widely. We limit our direct customer sales channel inventory reporting to where we
can reliably gather and report inventory levels from our customers.
12In a number of countries outside of the U.S., we contract with distributors to support certain products. The services provided by these distributors vary by market,
but may include distribution and logistics; regulatory and pharmacovigilance; and/or sales, advertising or promotion. Sales in these distributor-based countries
represented approximately 1% of the Company’s total revenues in 2016.
Competition
The markets in which we compete are generally broad based and highly competitive. We compete with other worldwide research-based drug companies, many smaller
research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic drug manufacturers. Important competitive factors include product efficacy, safety and ease of
use, price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, customer service and R&D of new products and processes. Sales of our
products can be impacted by new studies that indicate a competitor’s product is safer or more effective for treating a disease or particular form of disease than one of
our products. Our revenues also can be impacted by additional labeling requirements relating to safety or convenience that may be imposed on products by the FDA
or by similar regulatory agencies in different countries. If competitors introduce new products and processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can
be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both.
Generic Competition
One of the biggest competitive challenges that we face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. In the U.S. and the EU, the regulatory approval process exempts
generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of
the innovator product. As a result, generic pharmaceutical manufacturers typically invest far less in R&D than research-based pharmaceutical companies and
therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded products. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces
intense price competition from generic forms of the product. Upon the expiration or loss of market exclusivity on a product, we can lose the major portion of revenues
of that product in a very short period of time.
The rate of revenues decline of a product after the expiration of exclusivity varies by country. In general, the decline in the U.S. market is more rapid than in most
other developed countries, though we have observed rapid declines in a number of EU countries as well. Also, the declines in developed countries tend to be more
rapid than in developing countries. The rate of revenues decline after the expiration of exclusivity has also historically been influenced by product characteristics. For
example, drugs that are used in a large patient population (e.g., those prescribed by key primary care physicians) tend to experience more rapid declines than drugs in
specialized areas of medicine (e.g., oncology). Drugs that are more complex to manufacture (e.g., sterile injectable products) usually experience a slower decline than
those that are simpler to manufacture.
In certain countries outside the U.S., patent protection is weak or nonexistent and we must compete with generic versions shortly after we launch our innovative
products. In addition, generic pharmaceutical companies may introduce a generic product before exclusivity has expired, and before the resolution of any related
patent litigation. For more information about market exclusivity, refer to “—Intellectual Property and Product Exclusivity” above.
We believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet
medical needs, together with our ability to manufacture products efficiently and to market them effectively in a highly competitive environment.
Pricing, Price Constraints and Market Access
Our medicines are priced based on a number of factors, including the value of scientific innovation for patients and society in the context of overall health care spend,
economic factors impacting health care systems’ ability to provide appropriate and sustainable access and the necessity to sustain our investment in innovation
platforms to address serious unmet medical needs. Central to price is the clinical value that this innovation brings to the market, the current landscape of alternative
treatment options, the goal of ensuring appropriate patient access to this innovation and sustaining investment in creative platforms. We continue to explore new
pricing approaches to ensure that patients have access to our medicines. Enhancing patient access to medicines is a priority for us. We are focused on offering
creative tiered pricing, voluntary licensing, reimbursement support and patient assistance programs to optimize access while protecting innovation; advocating for
sustainable healthcare policies and infrastructure, leveraging advocacy/payer’s input and utilizing partnerships as appropriate; and improving access to care and
supportive services for vulnerable patients through partnerships and demonstration projects.
The growth of MCOs in the U.S. is also a major factor in the healthcare marketplace. Over half of the U.S. population now participates in some version of managed
care. MCOs can include medical insurance companies, medical plan administrators, health-maintenance organizations, Medicare Part D prescription drug plans,
alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations. Those organizations have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their
purchasing strength and importance to us.
13To successfully compete for business with MCOs, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as
compared with other forms of care. Most new products that we introduce compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by
competitors. As noted above, generic drugs are exempt from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy and, as such, often
have lower costs than brand-name drugs. MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics for this reason. Many governments also
encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and in many cases require,
pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brand-name drug. The substitution must
be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it.
Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in the MCO patient population. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete
aggressively to have their products included. Where possible, companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products, such as greater
efficacy, better patient ease of use or fewer side effects. A lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. Products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic
advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price. We have been generally, although not universally, successful in having our major products included
on MCO formularies.
In many markets outside the U.S., we operate in an environment of government-mandated, cost-containment programs. In these markets, a significant portion of
funding for healthcare services and the determination of pricing and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products is subject to government control. As a result, our
products may face restricted access by both public and private payers and may be subject to assessments of comparative value and effectiveness against
competitive products. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic
drugs and/or enacted across-the-board price cuts as methods of cost control. In most EU countries, for example, the government regulates pricing of a new product at
launch often through direct price controls, international price comparisons, controlling profits and/or reference pricing. In other markets, such as Germany, the
government does not set pricing restrictions at launch, but pricing freedom is subsequently limited. Companies may also face significant delays in market access for
new products, mainly in France, Spain, Italy and Belgium, and more than a year can elapse before new medicines become available on some national markets.
Additionally, member states of the EU have regularly imposed new or additional cost containment measures for pharmaceuticals such as volume discounts, cost
caps, cost sharing for increases in excess of prior year costs for individual products or aggregated market level spending, outcome-based pricing schemes and free
products for a portion of the expected therapy period. In recent years, Italy, for example, has imposed mandatory price decreases. The existence of price differentials
within the EU due to the different national pricing and reimbursement laws leads to significant parallel trade flows.
Government Regulation
The pharmaceutical industry is subject to extensive global regulation by regional, country, state and local agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, other
Federal statutes and regulations, various state statutes and regulations, and laws and regulations of foreign governments govern to varying degrees the testing,
approval, production, labeling, distribution, post-market surveillance, advertising, dissemination of information and promotion of our products. The lengthy process
of laboratory and clinical testing, data analysis, manufacturing, development and regulatory review necessary for required governmental approvals is extremely costly
and can significantly delay product introductions in a given market. Promotion, marketing, manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are extensively
regulated in all major world markets. In addition, our operations are subject to complex Federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws
and regulations. We anticipate that the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the introduction of new products will
continue to require substantial scientific and technical effort, time and expense as well as significant capital investments.
Of particular importance is the FDA in the U.S. It has jurisdiction over virtually all of our activities and imposes requirements covering the testing, safety,
effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, advertising and post-marketing surveillance of our products. In many cases, the FDA requirements have increased
the amount of time and money necessary to develop new products and bring them to market in the U.S.
The FDA mandates that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with cGMP established by the FDA. In complying with cGMP regulations,
manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in production, recordkeeping and quality control to ensure that products meet applicable
specifications and other requirements to ensure product safety and efficacy. The FDA periodically inspects our drug manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance
with applicable cGMP requirements. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects us to possible legal or regulatory action, such as
suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product. Adverse experiences with the use of products must be reported to the FDA and
could result in the imposition of market restrictions through labeling changes or product removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory
requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy occur following approval.
14The Federal government has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers, including authority to withdraw or delay product
approvals, commence actions to seize and prohibit the sale of unapproved or non-complying products, to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance
with cGMPs, and to impose or seek injunctions, voluntary recalls, civil, monetary and criminal penalties. Such a restriction or prohibition on sales or withdrawal of
approval of products marketed by us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.
Marketing authorization for our products is subject to revocation by the applicable governmental agencies. In addition, modifications or enhancements of approved
products or changes in manufacturing locations are in many circumstances subject to additional FDA approvals, which may or may not be received and which may
be subject to a lengthy application process.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to the PDMA as part of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which regulates such activities at both the
Federal and state level. Under the PDMA and its implementing regulations, states are permitted to require registration of manufacturers and distributors who provide
pharmaceuticals even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. States are also permitted to adopt regulations limiting the
distribution of product samples to licensed practitioners. The PDMA also imposes extensive licensing, personnel recordkeeping, packaging, quantity, labeling,
product handling and facility storage and security requirements intended to prevent the sale of pharmaceutical product samples or other product diversions.
The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 imposed additional obligations on pharmaceutical companies and delegated more enforcement authority to the FDA in the area of
drug safety. Key elements of this legislation give the FDA authority to (1) require that companies conduct post-marketing safety studies of drugs, (2) impose certain
drug labeling changes relating to safety, (3) mandate risk mitigation measures such as the education of healthcare providers and the restricted distribution of
medicines, (4) require companies to publicly disclose data from clinical trials and (5) pre-review television advertisements.
The marketing practices of all U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to Federal and state healthcare laws that are used to protect the integrity of government
healthcare programs. The OIG oversees compliance with applicable Federal laws, in connection with the payment for products by government funded programs
(primarily Medicaid and Medicare). These laws include the Federal anti-kickback statute, which criminalizes the offering of something of value to induce the
recommendation, order or purchase of products or services reimbursed under a government healthcare program. The OIG has issued a series of Guidances to
segments of the healthcare industry, including the 2003 Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, which includes a recommendation that
pharmaceutical manufacturers, at a minimum, adhere to the PhRMA Code, a voluntary industry code of marketing practices. We subscribe to the PhRMA Code, and
have implemented a compliance program to address the requirements set forth in the guidance and our compliance with the healthcare laws. Failure to comply with
these healthcare laws could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings, including actions by Federal and state government agencies. Such actions could
result in the imposition of civil and criminal sanctions, which may include fines, penalties and injunctive remedies, the impact of which could materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.
We are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal and state regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies, such as the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services in the U.S. We are also licensed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency to
procure and produce controlled substances. We are, therefore, subject to possible administrative and legal proceedings and actions by these organizations. Such
actions may result in the imposition of civil and criminal sanctions, which may include fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies.
The U.S. healthcare industry is subject to various government-imposed regulations authorizing prices or price controls that have and will continue to have an impact
on our total revenues. We participate in state government Medicaid programs, as well as certain other qualifying Federal and state government programs whereby
discounts and rebates are provided to participating state and local government entities. We also participate in government programs that specify discounts to certain
government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. These entities receive minimum
discounts based off a defined “non-federal average manufacturer price” for purchases. As a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (HR 3590) and
the reconciliation bill containing a package of changes to the healthcare bill, we have experienced and will continue to experience additional financial costs and
certain other changes to our business. For example, minimum rebates on our Medicaid drug sales have increased from 15.1 percent to 23.1 percent and Medicaid
rebates have also been extended to drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans. In addition, we extend discounts to certain critical access hospitals,
cancer hospitals and other covered entities as required by the expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program under the Public Health Service Act.
We are required to provide a 50 percent discount on our brand-name drugs to patients who fall within the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also referred to as the
“donut hole” and pay an annual non-tax-deductible fee to the federal government based on an allocation of our market share of branded drug sales to certain
government programs including Medicare, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Defense and TRICARE.
15Our activities outside the U.S. are also subject to regulatory requirements governing the testing, approval, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling and
marketing of our products. These regulatory requirements vary from country to country. Whether or not FDA approval or approval of the EC has been obtained for a
product, approval of the product by comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. or the EU, as the case may be, must be obtained prior to
marketing the product in those countries. The approval process may be more or less rigorous from country to country, and the time required for approval may be
longer or shorter than that required in the U.S. Approval in one country does not assure that a product will be approved in another country.
For further discussion of these rebates and programs, refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
Total Revenues” and “—Critical Accounting Policies.”
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
In general, we purchase our raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products in the open market. For some products, we purchase our raw
materials and supplies from one source (the only source available to us) or a single source (the only approved source among many available to us), thereby requiring
us to obtain such raw materials and supplies from that particular source. We attempt, if possible, to mitigate our raw material supply risks, through inventory
management and alternative sourcing strategies. For further discussion of sourcing, refer to “—Manufacturing and Quality Assurance” below and discussions of
particular products.
Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
We operate and manage our manufacturing network in a manner that permits us to improve efficiency while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing
capacity. Pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated and vary widely from product to product. Given that shifting or adding manufacturing
capacity can be a lengthy process requiring significant capital and other expenditures as well as regulatory approvals, we maintain and operate our flexible
manufacturing network, consisting of internal and external resources that minimize unnecessary product transfers and inefficient uses of manufacturing capacity. For
further discussion of the regulatory impact on our manufacturing, refer to “—Government Regulation and Price Constraints” above.
Our pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are located in the U.S., Puerto Rico, France, Italy, Ireland, Japan and China and require significant ongoing capital
investment for both maintenance and compliance with increasing regulatory requirements. In addition, as our product line changes over the next several years, we
expect to continue modification of our existing manufacturing network to meet complex processing standards that may be required for newly introduced products,
including biologics. Biologics manufacturing involves more complex processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. The FDA approved our large
scale multi-product bulk biologics manufacturing facility in Devens, Massachusetts in May 2012 and we continue to make capital investments in this facility. We are
building a new large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Cruiserath, Ireland.
We rely on third parties to manufacture or supply us with all or a portion of the active ingredients necessary for us to manufacture various products, such as Opdivo,
Sprycel, Yervoy, Eliquis, Orencia, Baraclude, Reyataz and the Sustiva Franchise. To maintain a stable supply of these products, we take a variety of actions
including inventory management and maintenance of additional quantities of materials, when possible, designed to provide for a reasonable level of these ingredients
to be held by the third-party supplier, us or both, so that our manufacturing operations are not interrupted. As an additional protection, in some cases, we take steps
to maintain an approved back-up source where available. For example, we rely on the capacity of our Devens, Massachusetts facility and the capacity available at our
third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture Orencia.
In connection with divestitures, licensing arrangements or distribution agreements of certain of our products, or in certain other circumstances, we have entered into
agreements under which we have agreed to supply such products to third parties. In addition to liabilities that could arise from our failure to supply such products
under the agreements, these arrangements could require us to invest in facilities for the production of non-strategic products, result in additional regulatory filings
and obligations or cause an interruption in the manufacturing of our own products.
Our success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and
effectiveness. Product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations, including research and development, purchasing, facilities
planning, manufacturing, and distribution. We maintain quality-assurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of technical information and production
processes.
Control of production processes involves detailed specifications for ingredients, equipment and facilities, manufacturing methods, processes, packaging materials
and labeling. We perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to ensure that the product meets regulatory requirements and our
standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses, microbiological testing or a combination of these along with other analyses. Quality
control is provided by business unit/site quality assurance groups that monitor existing manufacturing procedures and systems used by us, our subsidiaries and
third-party suppliers.
16Environmental Regulation
Our facilities and operations are subject to extensive U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety,
including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water; the use, management and disposal of hazardous, radioactive and biological materials and
wastes; and the cleanup of contamination. Pollution controls and permits are required for many of our operations, and these permits are subject to modification,
renewal or revocation by the issuing authorities.
Our environment, health and safety group monitors our operations around the world, providing us with an overview of regulatory requirements and overseeing the
implementation of our standards for compliance. We also incur operating and capital costs for such matters on an ongoing basis, which were not material for 2016,
2015 and 2014. In addition, we invested in projects that reduce resource use of energy and water. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with
applicable environmental, health and safety requirements and the permits required for our operations, we nevertheless could incur additional costs, including civil or
criminal fines or penalties, clean-up costs or third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, for violations or liabilities under these laws.
Many of our current and former facilities have been in operation for many years, and over time, we and other operators of those facilities have generated, used, stored
or disposed of substances or wastes that are considered hazardous under Federal, state and/or foreign environmental laws, including CERCLA. As a result, the soil
and groundwater at or under certain of these facilities is or may be contaminated, and we may be required to make significant expenditures to investigate, control and
remediate such contamination, and in some cases to provide compensation and/or restoration for damages to natural resources. Currently, we are involved in
investigation and remediation at 14 current or former facilities. We have also been identified as a PRP under applicable laws for environmental conditions at
approximately 20 former waste disposal or reprocessing facilities operated by third parties at which investigation and/or remediation activities are ongoing.
We may face liability under CERCLA and other Federal, state and foreign laws for the entire cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated sites, or for natural
resource damages, regardless of fault or ownership at the time of the disposal or release. In addition, at certain sites we bear remediation responsibility pursuant to
contractual obligations. Generally, at third-party operator sites involving multiple PRPs, liability has been or is expected to be apportioned based on the nature and
amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable PRPs. For additional information about these matters, refer
to “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 18. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies.”
Employees
We have approximately 25,000 employees as of December 31, 2016.
Foreign Operations
We have significant operations outside the U.S. They are conducted both through our subsidiaries and through distributors.
International operations are subject to certain risks, which are inherent in conducting business abroad, including, but not limited to, currency fluctuations, possible
nationalization or expropriation, price and exchange controls, counterfeit products, limitations on foreign participation in local enterprises and other restrictive
governmental actions. Our international businesses are also subject to government-imposed constraints, including laws on pricing or reimbursement for use of
products.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.
Any of the factors described below could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, or credit ratings, which
could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or risks that we currently consider
immaterial, could also impair our operations or financial condition.
The public announcement of data from our clinical studies, or those of our competitors, or news of any developments related to our, or our competitors', IO
products or late-stage compounds may cause significant volatility in our stock price and depending on the news, may result in an adverse impact on our
business, financial condition or results of operation. If the development of any of our key IO compounds, whether alone or as part of a combination therapy, is
delayed or discontinued, our stock price could decline significantly and there may be an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.
We are focusing our efforts and resources in certain disease areas. With our more focused portfolio, investors are placing heightened scrutiny on some of our
products or late-stage compounds. In particular, Opdivo is an important asset in our IO portfolio. During 2016, we announced multiple regulatory milestones for
Opdivo. We also, however, encountered a significant setback in first-line lung cancer with the announcement of the negative results of CheckMate-026 and we
announced we would not pursue an accelerated regulatory pathway for the combination of Opdivo+Yervoy which had negative impacts on our stock price. In
2017, we expect to receive further news from ongoing clinical trials and health authorities for several new potential indications.
The announcement of data from our clinical studies, or those of our competitors, or news of any developments related to our, or our competitors', IO products or
late-stage compounds, such as Opdivo, may cause significant volatility in our stock price and depending on the news, may result in an adverse impact on our
business, financial condition or results of operation. Furthermore, the announcement of any negative or unexpected data or the discontinuation of development of
any of our key IO compounds, whether alone or as part of a combination therapy, any delay in our anticipated timelines for filing for regulatory approval or a
significant advancement of a competitor, may cause our stock price to decline significantly and may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition
or results of operations. There is no assurance that data from our clinical studies will support filings for regulatory approval, or that our key IO compounds may
prove to be effective or as effective as other competing compounds, or even if approved, that any of our key IO compounds will become commercially successful for
all approved indications.
We depend on several key products for most of our revenues, cash flows and earnings.
We have historically derived a majority of our revenue and earnings from several key products and while we are not as heavily dependent on one or two products
as in past years, our dependence on the profitability of certain products is likely to continue. We expect that growth products such as Opdivo and Eliquis will
become an increasingly important part of our revenue base. A reduction in revenues from one of these products could have an adverse impact our revenues, cash
flows and earnings.
We may experience difficulties or delays in the development and commercialization of new products.
Compounds or products may appear promising in development but fail to reach market within the expected or optimal timeframe, or at all. In addition, product
extensions or additional indications may not be approved. Developing and commercializing new compounds and products include inherent risks and
uncertainties, including (i) due to efficacy and safety concerns, delayed or denied regulatory approvals, delays or challenges with producing products on a
commercial scale or excessive costs to manufacture them; (ii) failure to enter into or implement optimal alliances for the development and/or commercialization of
new products; (iii) failure to maintain a consistent scope and variety of promising late-stage products; (iv) failure of one or more of our products to achieve or
maintain commercial viability; and (v) changes in regulatory approval processes may cause delays or denials of new product approvals.
Regulatory approval delays are especially common when a product is expected to have a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, as required by the FDA to
address significant risk/benefit issues. The inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new
product could negatively impact our revenues and earnings. In addition, if certain acquired pipeline programs (including IPRD) are canceled or we believe their
commercial prospects have been reduced, we may recognize material non-cash impairment charges for those programs. Finally, losing key molecules and
intermediaries or our compound library through a natural or man-made disaster or act of sabotage could negatively impact the product development cycle.
18We face intense competition from other manufacturers, including for both innovative medicines and lower-priced generic products.
BMS is dependent on the market access, uptake and expansion for marketed brands, new product introductions, new indications, product extensions and co-
promotional activities with alliance partners, to deliver future growth. Competition is keen and includes (i) lower-priced generics and increasingly aggressive
generic commercialization tactics, (ii) lower prices for other companies' products, real or perceived superior efficacy (benefit) or safety (risk) profiles or other
differentiating factors, (iii) technological advances and patents attained by our competitors, (iv) clinical study results from our products or a competitor’s
products that affect the value proposition for our products, (v) business combinations among our competitors and major third-party payers and (vi) competing
interests for external partnerships to develop and bring new products to markets. If we are unable to compete successfully against our competitors' products in the
marketplace, this could have a material negative impact on our revenues and earnings.
Litigation claiming infringement of intellectual property may adversely affect our future revenues and operating earnings.
Third parties may claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming
and may require us to enter into license agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other
intellectual property infringement could subject us to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected product or
products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.
Adverse outcomes in other legal matters could negatively affect our business.
Current or future lawsuits, claims, proceedings and government investigations could preclude or delay the commercialization of our products or could adversely
affect our operations, profitability, liquidity or financial condition, after any possible insurance recoveries, where available. Such legal matters include
(i) intellectual property disputes; (ii) adverse decisions in litigation, including product liability and commercial cases; (iii) anti-bribery regulations, such as the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practice Act or UK Bribery Act, including compliance with ongoing reporting obligations to the government resulting from any settlements,
(iv) recalls or withdrawals of pharmaceutical products or forced closings of manufacturing plants; (v) the failure to fulfill obligations under supply contracts
with the government and other customers; (vi) product pricing and promotional matters; (vii) lawsuits and claims asserting, or investigations into, violations of
securities, antitrust, Federal and state pricing, consumer protection, data privacy and other laws; (viii) environmental, health, safety and sustainability matters;
and (ix) tax liabilities resulting from assessments from tax authorities.
We could lose market exclusivity of a product earlier than expected.
In the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, the majority of an innovative product’s commercial value is realized during its market exclusivity period. In
the U.S. and in some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic versions are approved and marketed or when biosimilars are introduced (even
if only for a competing product), there are usually very substantial and rapid declines in a product’s revenues.
Market exclusivity for our products is based upon patent rights and certain regulatory forms of exclusivity. The scope of our patent rights varies from country to
country and may also be dependent on the availability of meaningful legal remedies in a country. The failure to obtain patent and other intellectual property
rights, or limitations on the use or loss of such rights, could be material to us. In some countries, including certain EU member states, basic patent protections for
our products may not exist because certain countries did not historically offer the right to obtain specific types of patents and/or we (or our licensors) did not file
in those countries. In addition, the patent environment can be unpredictable and the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty.
Absent relevant patent protection for a product, once the data exclusivity period expires, generic versions can be approved and marketed.
Generic and biosimilar product manufacturers as well as other groups seeking financial gain are also increasingly seeking to challenge patents before they
expire, and we could face earlier-than-expected competition for any products at any time. Patents covering our key products have been, and are likely to continue
to be, subject to patent litigation. For example, in February 2017 one of the EU patents for Sprycel was revoked by the Opposition Division of the EPO. As a
result, we may experience a decline in European revenues in the second half of 2017. Refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 18. Legal Proceedings and
Contingencies" for further information. In some cases, manufacturers may seek regulatory approval by submitting their own clinical trial data to obtain
marketing approval or choose to launch a generic product “at risk” before the expiration of the applicable patent(s) and/or before the final resolution of related
patent litigation. There is no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full time period that appears in the estimates disclosed in
this Form 10-K or that we assume when we provide our financial guidance. In addition, some countries, such as India, are allowing competitors to manufacture
and sell competing generic products, which negatively impacts the protections afforded the Company. Lower-priced biosimilars for BMS biologic products or
competing biologics could negatively impact our volumes and prices.
19Increased pricing pressure and other restrictions in the U.S. and abroad from MCOs, institutional purchasers, and government agencies and programs, among
others, could negatively affect our revenues and profit margins.
Our products continue to be subject to increasing pressures across the portfolio from market access, pricing and discounting and other restrictions in the U.S., the
EU and other regions around the world, including from (i) rules and practices of MCOs and institutional and governmental purchasers; (ii) judicial decisions
and changes in laws and regulations for federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and other government actions and inquiries; (iii) the
potential impact of changes to pharmaceutical reimbursement, and increased pricing pressure from Medicare Part D formularies, Medicare Part B reimbursement
rates to physicians as well as commercial formularies in general; (iv) reimbursement delays; (v) government price erosion mechanisms across Europe and in other
countries, resulting in deflation for pharmaceutical product pricing; (vi) collection delays or failures to pay in government-funded public hospitals outside the
U.S. (vii) the impact on pricing from parallel trade across borders; (viii) other developments in technology and/or industry practices that could impact the
reimbursement policies and practices of third-party payers; and (ix) inhibited market access due to real or perceived differences in value propositions for our
products compared to competing products.
Changes in U.S. or foreign laws and regulations (including tax regulations) may negatively affect our revenues and profit margins.
We could become subject to new government laws and regulations, which could negatively affect our business, our operating results and the financial condition
of our Company, such as (i) additional healthcare reform initiatives in the U.S. or in other countries, including additional mandatory discounts or fees; (ii)
changing tax rates; changing the tax base including limiting, phasing-out or eliminating deductions or tax credits; taxing certain excess income from intellectual
property; changing rules for earnings repatriations; and changing other tax laws in the U.S. or other countries; (iii) new laws, regulations and judicial or other
governmental decisions affecting pricing, drug reimbursement, receivable payments, and access or marketing within or across jurisdictions; (iv) changes in
intellectual property law; (v) changes in accounting standards; (vi) increasing data privacy regulations and enforcement; (vii) emerging and new global
regulatory requirements for reporting payments and other value transfers to healthcare professionals; and (viii) the potential impact of importation restrictions,
legislative and/or other regulatory changes.
Third-party royalties represent a significant percentage of our pretax income and operating cash flow.
We have entered into several arrangements which entitle us to potential royalties from third parties for out-licensed intellectual property, commercialization
rights and sales-based contingent proceeds related to the divestiture of businesses. In many of these arrangements we have minimal, if any, continuing
involvement that contribute to the financial success of those activities. Royalties have continued to represent a significant percentage of our pretax income,
including royalties related to the divestiture of our diabetes business (including the transfer of certain future royalty rights pertaining to Amylin product sales),
our Sanofi alliance, out-licensed intellectual property and contingent proceeds resulting from the Erbitux* businesses. Pretax income generated from royalties
were approximately $1.0 billion in 2016. Our pretax income could be adversely affected if the royalty streams decline in future periods.
Failure to execute our business strategy could adversely impact our growth and profitability.
Our strategy is focused on delivering innovative, transformational medicines to patients. If we are unable to successfully execute on this strategy, this could
negatively impact our future results of operations and market capitalization. In connection with this strategy, we recently announced an evolution to our
operating model to focus on investment in commercial opportunities against key brands and markets, accelerate the pipeline, streamline operations and realign
manufacturing capabilities that broaden biologics capabilities, among other things. Our ability to successfully execute our operating model evolution could
impact our results. For example, if we are not able to achieve the cost savings we expect, this could negatively impact our operating margin and earnings results.
In addition, we may not be able to consistently maintain a rich pipeline, through internal R&D programs or transactions with third parties, to support future
revenue growth. Competition among pharmaceutical companies for acquisition and product licensing opportunities is intense, and we may not be able to locate
suitable acquisition targets or licensing partners at reasonable prices, or successfully execute such transactions. If we are unable to support and grow our
marketed products, successfully execute the launches of newly approved products, advance our late-stage pipeline, manage change and operating model
evolution issues and manage our costs effectively, our operating results and financial condition could be negatively impacted.
Failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could affect our ability to successfully develop and commercialize products.
Our success is largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as
personnel with expertise in clinical R&D, governmental regulation and commercialization. Competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is
intense. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain quality personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase.
20Any businesses or assets we acquire in the future may underperform, and we may not be able to successfully integrate them into our existing business.
We may continue to support our pipeline with compounds or products obtained through licensing and acquisitions. Future revenues, profits and cash flows of an
acquired company’s products, technologies and pipeline candidates, may not materialize due to lower product uptake, delayed or missed pipeline opportunities,
the inability to capture expected synergies, increased competition, safety concerns, regulatory issues, supply chain problems or other factors beyond our control.
Substantial difficulties, costs and delays could result from integrating our acquisitions, including for (i) R&D, manufacturing, distribution, sales, marketing,
promotion and information technology activities; (ii) policies, procedures, processes, controls and compliance; (iii) company cultures; (iv) compensation
structures and other human resource activities; and (v) tax considerations.
We could experience difficulties and delays in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products.
Our product supply and related patient access could be negatively impacted by, among other things: (i) product seizures or recalls or forced closings of
manufacturing plants; (ii) our failure, or the failure of any of our suppliers, to comply with cGMP and other applicable regulations or quality assurance
guidelines that could lead to manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages or delays in product manufacturing; (iii) manufacturing, quality assurance/quality
control, supply problems or governmental approval delays; (iv) the failure of a sole source or single source supplier to provide us with the necessary raw
materials, supplies or finished goods within a reasonable timeframe and with required quality; (v) the failure of a third-party manufacturer to supply us with bulk
active or finished product on time; (vi) construction or regulatory approval delays for new facilities or the expansion of existing facilities, including those
intended to support future demand for our biologics products, such as Opdivo; (vii) the failure to meet new and emerging regulations requiring products to be
tracked throughout the distribution channels using unique identifiers to verify their authenticity in the supply chain; (viii) other manufacturing or distribution
issues, including limits to manufacturing capacity and changes in the types of products produced, such as biologics, physical limitations or other business
interruptions; and (ix) disruption in supply chain continuity including from natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we
have no control impacting one of our facilities or at a critical supplier.
Product labeling changes for our marketed products could result in a negative impact on revenues and profit margins.
We or regulatory authorities may need to change the labeling for any pharmaceutical product, including after a product has been marketed for several years.
These changes are often the result of additional data from post-marketing studies, head-to-head trials, adverse events reports, studies that identify biomarkers
(objective characteristics that can indicate a particular response to a product or therapy) or other studies or post-marketing experience that produce important
additional information about a product. New information added to a product’s label can affect its risk-benefit profile, leading to potential recalls, withdrawals or
declining revenue, as well as product liability claims. Sometimes additional information from these studies identifies a portion of the patient population that may
be non-responsive to a medicine or would be at higher risk of adverse reactions and labeling changes based on such studies may limit the patient population. The
studies providing such additional information may be sponsored by us, but they could also be sponsored by competitors, insurance companies, government
institutions, managed care organizations, scientists, investigators, or other interested parties. While additional safety and efficacy information from such studies
assist us and healthcare providers in identifying the best patient population for each product, it can also negatively impact our revenues due to inventory returns
and a more limited patient population going forward. Additionally, certain study results, especially from head-to-head trials, could affect a product’s formulary
listing, which could also adversely affect revenues.
The failure of third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, and other obligations could adversely affect our business.
We rely on suppliers, vendors, outsourcing partners, alliance partners and other third parties to research, develop, manufacture, commercialize, co-promote and
sell our products, manage certain marketing, selling, human resource, finance, IT and other business unit and functional services, and meet their contractual,
regulatory and other obligations. Using these third parties poses a number of risks, such as: (i) they may not perform to our standards or legal requirements; (ii)
they may not produce reliable results; (iii) they may not perform in a timely manner; (iv) they may not maintain confidentiality of our proprietary information; (v)
disputes may arise with respect to ownership of rights to technology developed with our partners; and (vi) disagreements could cause delays in, or termination of,
the research, development or commercialization of the product or result in litigation or arbitration. Moreover, some third parties are located in markets subject to
political and social risk, corruption, infrastructure problems and natural disasters, in addition to country specific privacy and data security risk given current
legal and regulatory environments. The failure of any critical third party to meet its obligations, including for future royalty and milestone payments; adequately
deploy business continuity plans in the event of a crisis; and/or satisfactorily resolve significant disagreements with us or address other factors, could have a
material adverse impact on our operations and results. In addition, if these third parties violate, or are alleged to have violated, any laws or regulations,
including the local pharmaceutical code, U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, UK Bribery Act and other similar laws and regulations, during the performance of
their obligations for us, it is possible that we could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes, including possible legal consequences.
21The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or stolen products could have a negative impact on our reputation and
business.
Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. A patient
who receives a counterfeit drug may be at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of
counterfeit drugs sold under our brand name. In addition, thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are then not properly stored and are
later sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business.
We are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including from cybersecurity breaches and data leakage.
We rely extensively on IT systems, networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, physical security systems and
other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted provided and/or used for third-parties or their vendors, to
assist in conducting our business. A significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems or
infrastructure, by our workforce, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. The ever-increasing
use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional dissemination or intentional destruction of
confidential information stored in our or our third-party providers' systems, portable media or storage devices. We could also experience a business interruption,
theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our system
infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. Although the aggregate impact on our operations and financial condition
has not been material to date, we have been the target of events of this nature and expect them to continue as cybersecurity threats have been rapidly evolving in
sophistication and becoming more prevalent in the industry. We have invested in industry appropriate protections and monitoring practices of our data and IT to
reduce these risks and continue to monitor our systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance, however, that our
efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches to our or our third-party providers’ databases or systems that could adversely affect our business.
Increased use of social media platforms present risks and challenges.
We are increasing our use of social media to communicate Company news and events. The inappropriate and/or unauthorized use of certain media vehicles could
cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications, including from the improper collection and/or dissemination of personally
identifiable information from employees, patients, healthcare professionals or other stakeholders. In addition, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us
on any social networking website could damage our reputation, brand image and goodwill. Further, the disclosure of non-public Company-sensitive information
by our workforce or others through external media channels could lead to information loss. Identifying new points of entry as social media continues to expand
presents new challenges.
Adverse changes in U.S., global, regional or local economic conditions could adversely affect our profitability.
Global economic risks pose significant challenges to a company’s growth and profitability and are difficult to mitigate. We generated approximately 45% of our
revenues outside of the U.S. in 2016. As such, our revenues, earnings and cash flow are exposed to risk from a strengthening U.S. dollar. The world’s major
economies hold historically-high debt levels and many are experiencing slow growth and high unemployment rates. We have exposure to customer credit risks in
Europe, South America and other markets including from government-guaranteed hospital receivables in markets where payments are not received on time. We
have significant operations in Europe, including for manufacturing and distribution. The results of our operations could be negatively impacted by any member
country exiting the eurozone monetary union or EU, including the exit of the UK from the EU. In addition, future pension plan funding requirements continue to
be sensitive to global economic conditions and the related impact on equity markets.
There can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends or repurchase stock.
The declaration, amount and timing of any dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors. The Board's decision will depend on many factors,
including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and
other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction or elimination of our dividend payments or dividend program could adversely affect our
stock price. In addition, we could, at any time, decide not to buy back any more shares in the market, which could also adversely affect our stock price.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company is a global specialty biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help
patients prevail over serious diseases. Refer to the Summary of Abbreviated Terms at the end of this 2016 Form 10-K for terms used throughout the document.
In 2016, we received 19 approvals for new medicines and additional indications and formulations of currently marketed medicines in major markets (the U.S., EU and
Japan) as well as announced multiple regulatory milestone achievements for Opdivo. We also encountered a significant setback in first-line lung cancer with the
announcement of negative results of CheckMate-026 and we announced we would not pursue an accelerated regulatory pathway for the Opdivo+Yervoy combination
therapy in first-line lung cancer. We are pursuing a broad program in first-line lung cancer encompassing combinations of Opdivo+Yervoy, Opdivo and
chemotherapy and Opdivo combined with Yervoy and chemotherapy. We are also committed to investigating Opdivo in combination with Yervoy and other anti-
cancer agents for other tumor types. We continue to believe that the breadth and depth of our IO portfolio positions us well for the future. We have 10 new IO
compounds in clinical development and trials across 35 different tumor types. In October 2016, we announced an evolution to our operating model which is discussed
in "—Strategy" below.
Our revenues increased by 17% in 2016 as a result of higher Opdivo, Eliquis and Orencia product sales. These impacts were partially offset by the expiration of our
U.S. commercialization rights to Abilify*, the transfer of Erbitux* rights in North America and increased competition for Reyataz, Sustiva and Baraclude in certain
markets.
The increase in GAAP EPS from $0.93 in 2015 to $2.65 in 2016 was due to higher revenues, divestiture gains and royalties and lower R&D license and asset
acquisition charges partially offset by higher Eliquis profit sharing and Opdivo related expenses. The tax impact of specified items and earnings mix contributed to
the change in the effective tax rate. After adjusting for divestiture gains, R&D license and asset acquisition charges and other specified items, non-GAAP EPS
increased from $2.01 in 2015 to $2.83 in 2016.

Strategy
Our focus as a specialty biopharmaceutical company is on discovering, developing and delivering transformational medicines that address serious unmet medical
needs. Our strategy is to combine the resources, scale and capability of a pharmaceutical company with the speed and focus on innovation of the biotech industry.
Our four strategic priorities are to drive business performance, continue to build a strong franchise in IO, maintain a diversified portfolio both within and outside of
IO, and continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation, including establishing partnerships and collaborations as an essential component of successfully
delivering transformational medicines to patients.
We are developing new medicines in the following core therapeutic areas: oncology, including IO, immunoscience, cardiovascular, fibrotic disease and GDD. In IO,
we continue to invest through new studies in monotherapy, combination therapy and with new molecules and mechanisms of action. Delivering promising new
treatment options to patients with lung cancer as quickly as possible has been and continues to be a priority for our company. We continue to invest significantly in
our deep pipeline of innovative medicines covering a broad array of cancers and have entered into several collaboration agreements to research and develop Opdivo
and other approved or investigational oncology agents in combination regimens, including with Yervoy. We remain focused and well-resourced in our first-line
29lung development programs, and continuously look for ways to strengthen our broad portfolio and bring forward new treatments. Beyond cancer, we continue to
strengthen our early stage portfolio in immunoscience, cardiovascular, and fibrotic diseases internally and through our partnerships with a diverse group of
companies and academic institutions in new and expanded research activities. We believe our internal and external focus is differentiated and contributes to the
transformation of our portfolio.
Our commercial model continues to evolve and our marketed product portfolio is growing in a manner consistent with our overall strategy. We continue to drive
growth of Opdivo by expanding into additional indications and tumor types both as a monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents.
Beyond Opdivo and Yervoy, we are building on the continued success and remain strongly committed to Eliquis, Orencia and Sprycel. Our commercial infrastructure
is uniquely leveraged for potential growth.
In 2016, we announced plans for a multi-year evolution to our operating model by focusing commercial and R&D resources on key brands and markets, delivering
leaner administrative functions and streamlining our manufacturing network to reflect the importance of biologics in our current and future portfolio. The new
operating model will enable us to deliver the strategic, financial and operational flexibility necessary to invest in the highest priorities.
Looking ahead, we will continue to implement our biopharma strategy by driving the growth of key brands, executing product launches, investing in our diverse and
innovative pipeline, including through business development, focusing on prioritized markets, increasing investments in our biologics manufacturing capabilities and
maintaining a culture of continuous improvement.
Acquisition and Licensing Arrangements
Acquisition and licensing transactions allow us to focus our resources behind our growth opportunities that drive the greatest long-term value. We are focused on
the following core therapeutic areas: oncology, including IO, immunoscience, cardiovascular and fibrotic diseases. Significant transactions entered into in 2016 are
summarized below:
Nitto Denko
In December 2016, BMS and Nitto Denko entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement granting BMS the right to develop and commercialize Nitto Denko's
investigational siRNA molecules targeting HSP47 in vitamin A containing formulations, which includes Nitto Denko's lead asset ND-L02-s0201, currently in Phase Ib
study for the treatment of advanced liver fibrosis. The agreement also grants BMS the option to receive exclusive licenses for HSP47 siRNAs in vitamin A containing
formulations for the treatment of lung fibrosis and other organ fibrosis.
Cormorant
In July 2016, BMS acquired all of the outstanding shares of Cormorant, a private pharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapies for cancer and
rare diseases. The acquisition provides BMS with full rights to Cormorant's lead candidate HuMax-IL8, a Phase I/II monoclonal antibody that represents a potentially
complementary IO mechanism of action to T-cell directed antibodies and co-stimulatory molecules.
Padlock
In April 2016, BMS acquired all of the outstanding shares of Padlock, a private biotechnology company dedicated to creating new medicines to treat destructive
autoimmune diseases. The acquisition provides BMS with full rights to Padlock’s PAD inhibitor discovery program focused on the development of potentially
transformational treatment approaches for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Padlock’s PAD discovery program may have additional utility in treating systemic lupus
erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases.
Portola
In February 2016, BMS and Pfizer entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Portola to develop and commercialize the investigational agent andexanet
alfa in Japan. Andexanet alfa is designed to reverse the anticoagulant activity of Factor Xa inhibitors, including Eliquis. BMS and Pfizer are responsible for all
development and regulatory activities for andexanet alfa in Japan and for exclusively commercializing the agent in Japan. Portola retains the rights to andexanet alfa
outside of Japan and will be responsible for the manufacturing supply.
In addition to the above transactions, in 2016, BMS provided notice of terminations to the California Institute for Biomedical Research pertaining to a research
collaboration agreement for the development of anti-fibrotic preclinical compounds and Dual Therapeutics, LLC pertaining to a research collaboration agreement for
the development of anti-cancer preclinical compounds.

(a) Other revenues include royalties and alliance-related revenues for products not sold by our regional commercial organizations.
(b) Foreign exchange impacts were derived by applying the prior period average currency rates to the current period sales.
The increase in U.S. revenues in 2016 resulted from higher demand for Opdivo, Eliquis and Daklinza, partially offset by the full year impact of the expiration/transfer
of commercialization rights to Abilify* and Erbitux*. Average U.S. net selling prices increased by approximately 5% after charge-backs, rebates and discounts. Refer
to "—Product Revenues Commentary" below for additional information.
The increase in U.S. revenues in 2015 resulted from the launch of Opdivo and Daklinza and higher demand for Eliquis and Sprycel partially offset by the partial year
impact of the expiration/transfer of commercialization rights to Abilify* and Erbitux*. Average U.S. net selling prices increased by approximately 3% after charge-
backs, rebates and discounts.
The increase in Europe revenues in 2016 resulted from higher demand for Opdivo and Eliquis partially offset by lower demand for Yervoy. Europe revenues in 2015
included the recognition of approximately $170 million of previously deferred Daklinza revenue in France.
The decrease in Europe revenues in 2015 resulted from unfavorable foreign exchange and the expiration of commercialization rights to Abilify* in the EU in June 2014
partially offset by the launch of Daklinza in certain EU countries in the third quarter of 2014 and higher demand for Eliquis. Europe revenues in 2015 were also
impacted by the recognition of previously deferred Daklinza revenue in France.
The decrease in Rest of the World revenues in 2016 resulted from increased competition for the Hepatitis C Franchise in Japan and unfavorable foreign exchange
(primarily Latin America) partially offset by higher demand for Opdivo and Eliquis.
The increase in Rest of the World revenues in 2015 resulted from the launch of the Daklinza and Sunvepra dual regimen in Japan in the third quarter of 2014 and
higher demand for Eliquis, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange (primarily in Japan).
The decrease in Other revenues in 2016 resulted from the expiration of certain supply arrangements. The decrease in Other revenues in 2015 resulted from the
expiration/transfer of certain licensing and royalty rights. Refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 3. Alliances" for further discussion of the alliances.
No single country outside the U.S. contributed more than 10% of total revenues in 2016, 2015 or 2014 except for Japan which contributed 10% of total revenues in
2015.
Gross-to-Net Adjustments
We recognize revenue net of gross-to-net adjustments that are further described in "—Critical Accounting Policies". Our share of certain Abilify* and Atripla*
revenues is reflected net of all gross-to-net adjustments in alliance and other revenues. Although not presented as a gross-to-net adjustment in the tables below, our
share of Abilify* and Atripla* gross-to-net adjustments were approximately $460 million in 2016, $1.1 billion in 2015 and $1.6 billion in 2014. These gross-to-net
adjustments decreased in 2016 and 2015 due to the expiration of our U.S. commercialization rights to Abilify* in April 2015.
31The activities and ending reserve balances for each significant category of gross-to-net adjustments were as follows:

Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 126 $ 520 $ 1,160 $ 1,806
The reconciliation of gross product sales to net product sales by each significant category of gross-to-net adjustments was as follows (excluding alliance and other
revenues such as Abilify* and Atripla*):
Year Ended December 31, % Change
Dollars in Millions 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014
Gross product sales $ 22,364 $ 17,166 $ 13,793 30% 24%
Gross-to-Net Adjustments
Charge-backs and cash discounts (1,582) (1,043) (755) 52% 38%
Medicaid and Medicare rebates (1,382) (859) (551) 61% 56%
Other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments (1,698) (1,219) (827) 39% 47%
Total Gross-to-Net Adjustments (4,662) (3,121) (2,133) 49% 46%
Net product sales $ 17,702 $ 14,045 $ 11,660 26% 20%
Changes in gross-to-net adjustments are primarily a function of changes in sales volume and payer channel mix, contractual and legislative discounts and rebates.
Gross-to-net adjustments have increased at a higher rate than gross product sales in 2016 and 2015 primarily because of the increasing mix of U.S. versus
international gross product sales where the adjustments are much higher.
• Charge-backs and cash discounts increased in both periods primarily due to higher Eliquis and Opdivo product sales in the U.S.
• Medicaid and Medicare rebates increased in both periods primarily due to higher Eliquis product sales in the U.S.
• Other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments increased in 2016 primarily due to higher worldwide sales of Eliquis and Opdivo and increased in 2015
due to higher sales of Eliquis and additional rebates for Daklinza of approximately $180 million for amounts previously deferred in France.

33Empliciti - a humanized monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma.
• Empliciti was launched in the U.S. in December 2015, in the EU in May 2016 and in Japan in September 2016.
Erbitux* —a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of certain types of metastatic colorectal cancer and SCCHN.
• BMS transferred its rights to Erbitux* in North America to Lilly in October 2015. Refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 3. Alliances” for further
discussion.
Opdivo — a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 on T and NKT cells that has been approved and continues to be investigated as an anti-cancer
treatment. Refer to "—Significant Product and Pipeline Approvals" for further discussion on the Opdivo approvals in 2016 and 2015.
• U.S. and international revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand resulting from the rapid commercial acceptance for several indications
including melanoma, head and neck, lung, kidney and blood cancer. We expect competition to increase in 2017.
Sprycel —an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinase indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia
in chronic phase and the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance or intolerance to
prior therapy, including Gleevec* (imatinib meslylate).
• U.S. revenues increased in both periods due to higher average net selling prices and demand.
• International revenues increased in 2016 due to higher demand. International revenues decreased in 2015 due to unfavorable foreign exchange partially offset by
higher demand. We may experience a decline in European revenues in the second half of 2017 due to the unfavorable EPO Board of Appeal's decision.
Yervoy — a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.
• U.S. revenues increased in 2016 due to higher demand as a result of the approvals for adjuvant treatment and the Opdivo+Yervoy regimen for patients with
metastatic melanoma. U.S. revenues decreased in 2015 due to lower demand resulting from the introduction of other IO products being used to treat patients
with melanoma, including Opdivo.
• International revenues decreased in 2016 due to lower demand resulting from the introduction of other IO products being used to treat patients with melanoma,
including Opdivo. International revenues decreased in 2015 due to unfavorable foreign exchange.
Eliquis — an oral Factor Xa inhibitor, targeted at stroke prevention in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and the prevention and treatment of venous
thromboembolic disorders.
• U.S. and international revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand resulting from increased commercial acceptance of novel oral anticoagulants and
market share gains.
Orencia — a fusion protein indicated for adult patients with moderate to severe active RA and is also indicated for reducing signs and symptoms in certain pediatric
patients with moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
• U.S. revenues increased in both periods due to higher average net selling prices and demand.
• International revenues increased in both periods due to higher demand partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange in 2015.
Baraclude — an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B.
• U.S. revenues continued to decrease in both periods due to the loss of exclusivity in September 2014.
• International revenues decreased in 2016 following the loss of exclusivity in South Korea in October 2015. International revenues decreased in 2015 due to
unfavorable foreign exchange partially offset by higher demand in certain countries.
Hepatitis C Franchise — Daklinza - an NS5A replication complex inhibitor; Sunvepra - an NS3 protease inhibitor.
• Daklinza was launched in the U.S. in July 2015.
• International revenues decreased in 2016 due to lower demand resulting from increased competition, primarily in Japan. International revenues in 2015 also
included the recognition of approximately $170 million of previously deferred Daklinza revenue in France. International revenues increased in 2015 due to
higher demand following the launch in certain EU countries and Japan in the third quarter of 2014 and the subsequent approvals in other international
markets in 2015.
• U.S. and international revenues are expected to significantly decline in 2017 due to lower demand resulting from increased competition.
34Reyataz Franchise —Includes Reyataz - a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV and Evotaz (atazanavir 300 mg and cobicistat 150 mg) - a combination therapy
containing Reyataz and Tybost*.
• U.S. revenues continued to decrease in both periods due to lower demand resulting from increased competition partially offset by higher average net selling
prices in 2016. The loss of exclusivity for Reyataz is expected in December 2017 and we may experience a higher decline in revenue in future periods due to
generic competition.
• International revenues continued to decrease in both periods due to lower demand resulting from increased competition and unfavorable foreign exchange.
Sustiva Franchise — a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, which includes Sustiva, an antiretroviral drug, and bulk efavirenz,
which is also included in the combination therapy, Atripla*.
• U.S. revenues continued to decrease in both periods due to lower demand resulting from increased competition partially offset by higher average net selling
prices. The loss of exclusivity for Sustiva is expected in December 2017 which may result in the termination of the joint venture agreement with Gilead and
may further reduce revenues beyond 2017.
• International revenues continued to decrease in both periods due to Sustiva's loss of exclusivity in Europe in November 2013.
Abilify* —an antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania disorder and major depressive disorder.
• U.S. commercialization rights to Abilify* expired in April 2015.
• International revenues decreased in both periods following the expiration of our EU commercialization rights in June 2014 and Otsuka becoming the principal for
the end customer sales in certain markets.
Mature Products and All Other — includes all other products, including those which have lost exclusivity in major markets, the diabetes alliance products, OTC
brands and royalty revenue.
• U.S. revenues decreased in 2016 due to the favorable impact of the sales return reserve reduction for Plavix* of $63 million in 2015. U.S. revenues decreased in
2015 primarily due to the diabetes business divestiture in February 2014.
• International revenues decreased in 2016 due to the expiration of certain supply arrangements, lower sales due to the divestiture of certain mature and other
products, increased competition for OTC products and unfavorable foreign exchange. International revenues decreased in 2015 due to the expiration/transfer
of certain licensing and royalty rights, the diabetes business divestiture, unfavorable foreign exchange and continued generic erosion.
Estimated End-User Demand
Pursuant to the SEC Consent Order described below under “—SEC Consent Order”, we monitor the level of inventory on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution
channel and outside of the U.S. in the direct customer distribution channel. We are obligated to disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on
hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. Estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand for the
following products were not material to our results of operations as of the dates indicated. No U.S. products had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution
channel in excess of one month on hand at December 31, 2016. Below are international products that had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in
excess of one month on hand at September 30, 2016.
Dafalgan, an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had 1.2 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to 1.2 months
of inventory on hand at June 30, 2016. The level of inventory on hand was primarily due to the ordering patterns of pharmacists in France.
Efferalgan, an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had 1.1 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to 1.2 months
of inventory on hand at June 30, 2016. The level of inventory on hand was primarily due to the ordering patterns of pharmacists in France.
Fervex, a cold and flu product, had 4.8 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to 4.2 months of inventory on hand at June 30, 2016. The
level of inventory on hand was primarily in France to support product seasonality.
Perfalgan, an analgesic product, had 2.4 months of inventory on hand internationally at direct customers compared to 2.9 months of inventory on hand at
June 30, 2016. The level of inventory on hand was primarily in the Gulf Countries and Saudi Arabia due to extended delivery lead time.
In the U.S., we generally determine our months on hand estimates using inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement provided by our three
largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 95% of total gross sales of U.S. products. Factors that may influence our estimates include generic competition,
seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new
customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their recordkeeping processes.
35Our non-U.S. businesses have significantly more direct customers. Information on available direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-
movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information varies widely. We limit our direct customer sales channel inventory reporting to where we
can influence demand. When this information does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of methodologies to estimate such data,
including using historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Given the
difficulties inherent in estimating third-party demand information, we evaluate our methodologies to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate
months on hand on an ongoing basis and make changes as necessary. Factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products,
price increases, new product launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer
purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for
non-U.S. business for the year ended December 31, 2016 is not available prior to the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K. We will disclose any product with
levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception, in the next quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

Cost of products sold
Cost of products sold include material, internal labor and overhead costs from our owned manufacturing sites, third-party processing costs and other supply chain
costs managed by our global manufacturing and supply organization. Cost of products sold also includes royalties and profit sharing attributed to licensed products
and alliances, foreign currency hedge settlement gains and losses and the amortization of acquired developed technology costs from business combinations and
regulatory approval milestones.
Cost of products sold typically vary between periods as a result of product mix and volume (particularly resulting from royalties and profit sharing expenses in
connection with our alliances), changes in foreign currency, price, inflation and costs attributed to the rationalization of manufacturing sites resulting in accelerated
depreciation, impairment charges and other stranded costs.
• Cost of products sold increased in 2016 primarily due to higher Eliquis profit sharing of $700 million, lower foreign currency hedge settlement gains and higher
Puerto Rico excise tax.
• Cost of products sold remained relatively flat in 2015 as higher Eliquis profit sharing of $532 million was offset by favorable foreign exchange.
Marketing, selling and administrative
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses include salary and benefit costs, third-party professional and marketing fees, outsourcing fees, shipping and handling
costs, advertising and product promotion and other expenses that are not attributed to product manufacturing costs or research and development expenses.
Expenses are managed through regional commercialization organizations or global enabling functions such as finance, legal, information technology and human
resources. Certain expenses are shared with alliance partners based upon contractual agreements. Expenses typically vary between periods due to new product
launch promotional activities.
• Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased in 2016 due to higher advertising and promotion and additional sales-related activities supporting
Opdivo partially offset by lower spend for virology products and favorable foreign exchange.
• Marketing, selling and administrative expenses remained relatively flat in 2015 as increased sales-related activities supporting Eliquis, Opdivo and the Hepatitis
C Franchise were offset by favorable foreign exchange and $96 million of additional expenses related to the Branded Prescription Drug Fee in 2014 resulting
from changes in IRS guidelines.
36Research and development
Research and development activities include discovery research, preclinical and clinical development, drug formulation, as well as clinical trials and medical support
of marketed products. Expenses include salary and benefit costs, third-party grants and fees paid to clinical research organizations, supplies, upfront and contingent
milestone payments for licensing and asset acquisitions of investigational compounds, IPRD impairment charges and proportionate allocations of enterprise-wide
costs. The allocations include facilities, information technology, employee stock compensation costs and other appropriate costs. Certain expenses are shared with
alliance partners based upon contractual agreements.
Expenses typically vary between periods for a number of reasons, including the timing of license and asset acquisition charges and IPRD impairment charges.
• Research and development expenses decreased in 2016 due to lower license and asset acquisition charges partially offset by the acceleration and expansion of
Opdivo development programs and capabilities and lower IPRD impairment charges.
• Research and development expenses increased in 2015 due to higher license and asset acquisition charges and the acceleration and expansion of Opdivo
development programs and capabilities partially offset by lower IPRD impairment charges and favorable foreign exchange.
• License and asset acquisition charges were $439 million in 2016, $1.7 billion in 2015 and $278 million in 2014 including $374 million for Padlock, Nitto Denko,
Flexus and Cormorant in 2016, $1.3 billion for Flexus, Cardioxyl and Five Prime in 2015 and $148 million for iPierian in 2014. A $100 million milestone was paid to
former shareowners of Flexus for the commencement of a Phase I clinical trial in 2016.
• IPRD impairment charges were $13 million in 2016, $160 million in 2015 and $343 million in 2014 including $160 million for LPA1 Antagonist in 2015 and $310
million for peginterferon lambda in 2014.
• Accelerated depreciation was $70 million in 2016 and $29 million in 2015 as a result of the expected exit of certain R&D sites in the U.S. Accelerated depreciation
results from the reduction in the estimated useful lives of the related assets for each site at various dates through 2020 and is expected to approximate $250
million in 2017.
Refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 3. Alliances, Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 13. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" and "—
Acquisition and Licensing Arrangements and —Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Specified Items" for further information.
Other (income)/expense
Other income increased $1.1 billion in 2016 due to higher divestiture gains and royalties and licensing income, and to a lesser extent, lower litigation and other
settlements, pension and debt redemption charges.
Other expense decreased $397 million in 2015 due to lower pension charges partially offset by lower divestiture gains.
• Divestiture gains were $576 million in 2016, $196 million in 2015 and $564 million in 2014 including certain OTC products and investigational HIV medicines
businesses in 2016, the Mount Vernon, Indiana manufacturing facility, Erbitux*, Ixempra* and certain mature and other OTC product businesses in 2015 and
the diabetes business in 2014.
• Royalties and licensing income were $719 million in 2016, $383 million in 2015 and $283 million in 2014 including contingent consideration from the Erbitux*
and diabetes business divestitures, including the transfer of certain future royalty rights pertaining to Amylin product sales.
• Pension charges were $91 million in 2016, $160 million in 2015 and $877 million in 2014 including an additional pension charge of $713 million following the
purchase of a group annuity contract from The Prudential Insurance Company of America in 2014.
• Provision for restructuring was $109 million in 2016, $118 million in 2015 and $163 million in 2014. In October 2016, the Company announced an evolution to its
operating model to drive the Company’s continued success in the near- and long-term through a more focused investment in commercial opportunities for key
brands and markets, a competitive and more agile R&D organization that can accelerate the pipeline, streamlined operations and realigned manufacturing
capabilities that broaden biologics capabilities to reflect the current and future portfolio. The new operating model will enable the Company to deliver the
strategic, financial and operational flexibility necessary to invest in the highest priorities across the Company. Restructuring charges of approximately $300
million are expected to be incurred in 2017 for all actions in addition to the accelerated depreciation impact discussed above.
Refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures, Note 5. Other (Income)/Expense, Note 6. Restructuring and Note 16. Pension and
Postretirement Benefit Plans" for further information.
37Income Taxes
Dollars in Millions 2016 2015 2014
Earnings Before Income Taxes $ 5,915 $ 2,077 $ 2,381
Provision for income taxes 1,408 446 352
Effective tax rate 23.8% 21.5% 14.8%
Historically, the effective income tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to our decision to indefinitely reinvest the earnings for certain of our
manufacturing operations in low tax jurisdictions such as Switzerland, Ireland and Puerto Rico. BMS operates under a favorable tax grant in Puerto Rico not
scheduled to expire prior to 2023.
The tax impact attributed to R&D charges, divestiture transactions and other specified items including additional transfer pricing reserves in 2014 increased the
effective tax rate by 1.8% in 2016 and 0.3% in 2015 and reduced the effective tax rate by 5.1% in 2014. No tax benefits were attributed to the R&D charges for Padlock,
Flexus and Cormorant in 2016, Flexus and Cardioxyl in 2015 and iPierian in 2014. Lower non-deductible goodwill allocated to business divestitures in 2015 and higher
valuation allowances attributed to capital loss carryforwards released in 2015 impacted the effective tax rates. Minimal income taxes were attributed to the diabetes
business divestiture gain in 2014 because of the capital loss deduction on the sale of the Amylin shares and tax basis differences resulting primarily from allocated
goodwill and Amylin deferred taxes. Unfavorable earnings mix between high and low tax jurisdictions and higher U.S. foreign tax credits resulting from the Puerto
Rico excise tax in all periods also impacted the effective tax rates. Refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 7. Income Taxes" for further information.
Comprehensive U.S. tax reform continues to be discussed and proposed, including among other items, changes to the corporate tax rate, a border adjustment tax and
changes to how the U.S. taxes foreign earnings. It is currently uncertain whether any of these changes will be enacted, and if so, the effective dates. If
comprehensive tax reform occurs, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be significantly impacted. However, we are unable to determine
the potential impact at this time.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Our non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and
other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. These items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have
one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not
indicative of future operating results. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods including restructuring costs,
accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, R&D charges in connection with the acquisition or licensing of third
party intellectual property rights, divestiture gains or losses, pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges and debt redemption gains or losses, among
other items. Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense,
deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates.
Non-GAAP information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance, supplement or enhance management, analysts and investors overall
understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. For example, non-GAAP earnings and EPS
information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. In addition, this
information is among the primary indicators we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning
and forecasting for future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted EPS prepared in
accordance with GAAP.

Net cash position $ 2,361 $ 2,241
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in the U.S. were approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2016. Most of the remaining $8.0 billion is held
primarily in low-tax jurisdictions and attributable to earnings expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. Cash repatriations are subject to restrictions in certain
jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and additional U.S. income taxes. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
together with cash generated from operations and issuance of commercial paper in the U.S. will be sufficient to satisfy our normal cash requirements for at least the
next few years, including dividends, capital expenditures, milestone payments, working capital and maturities of long-term debt.
Management continuously evaluates the Company’s capital structure to ensure the Company is financed efficiently, which may result in the repurchase of common
stock and debt securities, termination of interest rate swap contracts prior to maturity and issuance of debt securities. For example, we issued senior unsecured notes
in a registered public offering generating proceeds of $1.3 billion and redeemed/repurchased certain notes for nearly $2.0 billion during 2015. Refer to “Item 8.
Financial Statements—Note 9. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements” for further details.
The Company’s common stock repurchase capacity was increased to $4.1 billion during October 2016. The Company entered into ASR agreements to repurchase
approximately $2.0 billion of common stock in February 2017. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 15. Equity” for further details.
Dividend payments were $2.5 billion in 2016 and 2015 and $2.4 billion in 2014. Dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors. Capital
expenditures were approximately $1.2 billion in 2016, $800 million in 2015 and $500 million in 2014 and are expected to be approximately $1.0 billion in 2017 and $900
million in 2018. The higher spending is expected as a result of expanding our biologics manufacturing capabilities and other facility-related activities. For example, we
are constructing a new large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Ireland that will produce multiple therapies for our growing biologics portfolio when completed
in 2019.
Our marketable securities portfolio is subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors, which may impact our results of
operations. Our investment policy places limits on these investments and the amount and time to maturity of investments with any institution. The policy also
requires that investments are only entered into with corporate and financial institutions that meet high credit quality standards. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements
—Note 9. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements” for further details.
We currently have two separate $1.5 billion revolving credit facilities from a syndicate of lenders. The facilities provide for customary terms and conditions with no
financial covenants and were extended to October 2020 and July 2021. Each facility is extendable annually by one year on the anniversary date with the consent of
the lenders. No borrowings were outstanding under either revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016 or 2015.
Additional regulations in the U.S. could be passed in the future, which may reduce our results of operations, operating cash flow, liquidity and financial flexibility. We
continue to monitor the potential impact of the economic conditions in certain European and other countries and the related impact on prescription trends, pricing
discounts and creditworthiness of our customers. We believe these economic conditions will not have a material impact on our liquidity, cash flow or financial
flexibility.
The UK voted to depart from the EU during June 2016. Similar to other companies in our industry, certain regulatory, trade, labor and other aspects of our business
will likely be affected over time. However, we currently do not believe that these matters and other related financial effects will have a material impact on our
consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Our sales in the UK represent less than 2% of total revenues.
40Credit Ratings
BMS's long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's Investors Service are A2 and Prime-1, respectively, with a negative long-term credit outlook.
BMS's long-term and short-term credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poor's are A+ and A-1+, respectively, with a stable long-term credit outlook. BMS's long-term
and short-term credit ratings assigned by Fitch are A- and F2, respectively, with a stable long-term credit outlook. Our long-term ratings reflect the agencies' opinion
that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions. Our short-term ratings reflect
the agencies' opinion that we have good to extremely strong capacity for timely repayment. Any credit rating downgrade may affect the interest rate of any debt we
may incur, the fair market value of existing debt and our ability to access the capital markets generally.
Cash Flows
The following is a discussion of cash flow activities:
Dollars in Millions 2016 2015 2014
Cash flow provided by/(used in):
Operating activities $ 2,850 $ 1,832 $ 3,148
Investing activities 1,480 (1,572) 1,216
Financing activities (2,445) (3,351) (2,437)
Operating Activities
Cash flow from operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements from all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating
cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for noncontrolling interest, non-cash operating items, gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities
and changes in operating assets and liabilities resulting from timing differences between the receipts and payments of cash and when the transactions are recognized
in our results of operations. As a result, changes in cash from operating activities reflect the timing of cash collections from customers and alliance partners;
payments to suppliers, alliance partners and employees; customer discounts and rebates; and tax payments in the ordinary course of business. For example, annual
employee bonuses are typically paid in the first quarter of the subsequent year. In addition, cash collections continue to be impacted by longer payment terms for
certain biologic products in the U.S., primarily our newer oncology products including Opdivo, Yervoy and Empliciti (120 days to 150 days). The longer payment
terms are used to more closely align with the insurance reimbursement timing for physicians and cancer centers following administration to the patients.
The $1.0 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2016 was primarily attributable to:
• Higher operating cash flow attributed to increased sales and the timing of cash collections and payments in the ordinary course of business including the
wind-down of the Abilify* alliance in 2015; and
• Lower upfront and milestone payments for alliance and licensing arrangements (approximately $600 million).
Partially offset by:
• Higher income tax payments of approximately $1.4 billion.
The $1.3 billion decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 was primarily attributable to:
• Timing of payments with alliance partners (approximately $700 million), particularly active product ingredient supply and Medicaid rebates for Abilify*;
• Higher upfront payments for new alliance and licensing agreements (approximately $600 million); and
• Timing of customer collections resulting primarily from higher net product sales including those with extended payment terms for certain new products and
less factoring (approximately $400 million).
Partially offset by:
• The timing of other cash collections and payments in the ordinary course of business including among other items, changes in inventory levels, particularly
those related to Abilify*.
41Investing Activities
Cash requirements from investing activities include cash used for acquisitions, manufacturing and facility-related capital expenditures and purchases of marketable
securities with maturities greater than 90 days reduced by proceeds from business divestitures (including royalties) and the sale and maturity of marketable securities.
The $3.1 billion decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2016 was primarily attributable to:
• Higher net redemptions of marketable securities of approximately $2.1 billion in 2016 which were reinvested in cash equivalents to manage credit and interest
rate risks;
• Lower asset acquisition payments of approximately $800 million. Asset acquisitions include Cormorant and Padlock in 2016 and Flexus and Cardioxyl in 2015;
and
• Higher business divestiture proceeds of approximately $600 million including royalties and other contingent consideration received subsequent to the
divestiture. Divestitures include certain OTC products and investigational HIV businesses in 2016 and the Mount Vernon, Indiana manufacturing facility,
Ixempra* and mature and other OTC product businesses in 2015.
Partially offset by:
• Higher capital expenditures of approximately $400 million.
The $2.8 billion decrease in cash provided by investing activities in 2015 was primarily attributable to:
• Lower business divestiture proceeds of $2.9 billion. Divestitures include the Mount Vernon, Indiana manufacturing facility, Ixempra* and mature and other
OTC product businesses in 2015 and the diabetes business in 2014;
• Higher asset acquisition payments of approximately $900 million. Asset acquisitions include Flexus and Cardioxyl in 2015 and iPierian in 2014; and
• Higher capital expenditures of approximately $300 million.
Partially offset by:
• Lower net purchases of marketable securities of $1.3 billion in 2015; and
Financing Activities
Cash requirements from financing activities include cash used to pay dividends, repurchase common stock and repay long-term debt and other borrowings reduced
by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and issuance of long-term debt and other borrowings.
The $906 million decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2016 was primarily attributable to:
• Lower long-term net debt repayments of approximately $700 million; and
• Higher net short-term borrowings of approximately $600 million in 2016, consisting primarily of changes in bank overdrafts.
Partially offset by:
• Repurchase of common stock of approximately $200 million in 2016 (none in 2015).
The $914 million increase in cash used in financing activities in 2015 was primarily attributable to:
• Lower net short-term borrowings of approximately $700 million in 2015, consisting primarily of changes in bank overdrafts.
Contractual Obligations
Payments due by period for our contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 were as follows:
Obligations Expiring by Period

(a) Includes estimated future interest payments and periodic cash settlements of derivatives.
(b) Includes only short-term uncertain tax benefits because of uncertainties regarding the timing of resolution.
(c) Does not include pension liability.
42In addition to the above, we are committed to an aggregated $10.4 billion of potential future research and development milestone payments to third parties for in-
licensing, asset acquisitions and development programs including early-stage milestones of $3.0 billion (milestones achieved through Phase III clinical trials) and late-
stage milestones of $7.4 billion (milestones achieved post Phase III clinical trials). Payments generally are due and payable only upon achievement of certain
developmental and regulatory milestones for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. Some of these agreements also provide for sales-based milestones
aggregating $2.5 billion that we would be obligated to pay to alliance partners upon achievement of certain sales levels in addition to royalties. We also have certain
manufacturing, development and commercialization obligations in connection with alliance arrangements. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of these
obligations. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 3. Alliances” for further information regarding our alliances.
For a discussion of contractual obligations, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 7. Income Taxes,” “—Note 9. Financial Instruments and Fair Value
Measurements,”and “—Note 16. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities.”
SEC Consent Order / FCPA Settlement
As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and
accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period
ended September 30, 2004.
Under the terms of the Consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers,
distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month
of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. We also agreed in the Consent to certain measures that we have
implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business
risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes;
(d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and
(e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that come from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately
documenting that process.
We have established a company-wide policy to limit our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent. This policy includes the adoption
of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to
escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns.
In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis.
We maintain IMAs with our U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of our gross U.S. revenues. Under the current terms of the IMAs, our
wholesaler customers provide us with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products.
The three largest wholesalers currently account for approximately 95% of our gross U.S. revenues. The inventory information received from our wholesalers, together
with our internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. We estimate months on hand product inventory
levels for our U.S. business’s wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest
wholesalers. In contrast, our non-U.S. business has significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and
corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of
methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units.
We believe the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the Consent.
In addition, as previously disclosed, in October 2015, the Company reached a civil settlement with the SEC of alleged FCPA violations in which the Company agreed
to pay approximately $14.7 million in disgorgement, penalties and interest. As part of the settlement, the Company also agreed to a two-year self-monitoring period of
reporting to the government and is maintaining procedures to ensure compliance.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
For recently issued accounting standards, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 1. Accounting Policies—Recently Issued Accounting Standards.”
43Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses. Our critical accounting policies are those that significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations and require the
most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of
this uncertainty, actual results may vary from these estimates.
Revenue Recognition
Our accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates. Revenue is recognized when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and title and substantially all of the risks and rewards of
ownership have transferred (generally upon shipment except in certain EU markets which does not occur until delivery of the products to the customer). In 2014, we
deferred approximately $300 million invoiced for Daklinza under an early access program in France. A portion of this amount was recognized as revenue in 2015 when
final pricing was obtained. Revenue is also reduced for gross-to-net sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgment after
considering legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g. Medicare or Medicaid), current contract prices
under applicable programs, unbilled claims and processing time lags and inventory levels in the distribution channel. Estimates are assessed each period and
adjusted as required to revised information or actual experience.
In alliance arrangements involving the delivery of more than one element, each undelivered element is evaluated whether it qualifies as a separate unit of accounting.
The consideration that is fixed or determinable is then allocated to each undelivered element and is recognized as the related goods or services are delivered, limited
to the consideration that is not contingent upon future deliverables. Consideration associated with contingent milestones and royalties are allocated among the
underlying elements if and when the amounts are determined to be payable to BMS.
Gross-to-Net Adjustments
The following categories of gross-to-net adjustments involve significant estimates, judgments and information obtained from external sources. Refer to “—Total
Revenues” above for further discussion and analysis of each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments.
Charge-backs and cash discounts
Our U.S. business participates in programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of
Veterans Affairs, and other parties, including covered entities under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list
price to participating entities. These entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower program price and the wholesalers then charge us the difference
between their acquisition cost and the lower program price. Accounts receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed charge-back claims attributable
to a sale (typically within a two to four week time lag).
In the U.S. and certain other countries, cash discounts are offered as an incentive for prompt payment, generally approximating 2% of the sales price. Accounts
receivable is reduced for the estimated amount of unprocessed cash discounts (typically within a one month time lag).
Medicaid and Medicare rebates
Our U.S. business participates in state government Medicaid programs and other qualifying Federal and state government programs requiring discounts and rebates
to participating state and local government entities. All discounts and rebates provided through these programs are included in our Medicaid rebate accrual.
Medicaid rebates have also been extended to drugs used in managed Medicaid plans. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates is presented as a liability.
Rebates and discounts are offered to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. managing prescription drug programs and Medicare Advantage prescription drug
plans covering the Medicare Part D drug benefit. We also pay a 50% point of service discount to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services when the Medicare
Part D beneficiaries are in the coverage gap ("donut hole"). The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.
44Other rebates, returns, discounts and adjustments
Other gross-to-net sales adjustments include sales returns and all other programs based on applicable laws and regulations for individual non-U.S. countries as well
as rebates offered to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. to a lesser extent. The non-U.S. programs include several different pricing schemes such as cost
caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing schemes and pricing claw-backs that are based on sales of individual companies or an aggregation of all companies
participating in a specific market. The estimated amount of unpaid or unbilled rebates and discounts is presented as a liability.
Estimated returns for established products are determined after considering historical experience and other factors including levels of inventory in the distribution
channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products, introductions of
competitive new products and lower demand following the loss of exclusivity. The estimated amount for product returns is presented as a liability.
Estimated returns for new products are determined after considering historical sales return experience of similar products, such as those within the same product line,
similar therapeutic area and/or similar distribution model. We defer recognition of revenue until the right of return expires, sufficient historical experience to estimate
sales returns is developed in limited circumstances, or when insufficient historical experience with products in a similar therapeutic area, distribution method or other
characteristic is available. This typically occurs when the new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or when historical experience with products in
a similar therapeutic category is lacking. Estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand are also considered in estimating sales
returns for new products.
Use of information from external sources
Information from external sources is used to estimate gross-to-net adjustments. Our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers are based on the projected prescription
demand-based sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information
obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal
information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom
they sell, such as retailers and hospitals.
We have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. We use this methodology for internal demand
forecasts. We also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. Our estimates are subject to
inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations
including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information.
Retirement Benefits
Accounting for pension and postretirement benefit plans requires actuarial valuations based on significant assumptions for discount rates and expected long-term
rates of return on plan assets. In consultation with our actuaries, these significant assumptions and others such as salary growth, retirement, turnover, healthcare
trends and mortality rates are evaluated and selected based on expectations or actual experience during each remeasurement date. Pension expense could vary within
a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings, projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may
differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors.
The yield on high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of the plans’ estimated payouts is used in determining the discount rate. The Citi
Pension Discount curve is used for the U.S. plans. The present value of benefit obligations at December 31, 2016 for the U.S. pension plans was determined using a
4.0% discount rate. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the U.S. pension plans’ projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2016 was reduced by an
additional 1%, the projected benefit obligation would increase by approximately $900 million.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is estimated considering expected returns for individual asset classes with input from external advisors. We also
consider long-term historical returns including actual performance compared to benchmarks for similar investments. The U.S. plans’ pension expense for 2016 was
determined using a 7.8% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining the U.S. plans’
pension expense for 2016 was reduced by 1%, such expense would increase by $41 million.
For a more detailed discussion on retirement benefits, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 16. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities.”
45Business Combinations and Divestitures
Goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations, licensing and other transactions were $8.3 billion (representing 25% of total assets) at
December 31, 2016.
Accounting for transactions as business combinations and divestitures is significantly different than asset acquisitions and divestitures. For example, acquired IPRD
is capitalized for business combinations and expensed for asset acquisitions and the fair value of contingent consideration and goodwill are only recognized in
business combination transactions. Likewise, when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is divested, goodwill associated with that business is
included in the carrying value of the business in determining the gain or loss. Derecognition of goodwill does not occur in asset dispositions. As a result, it is
important to determine whether a business or an asset or group of assets is acquired or divested. A business is defined in ASC 805 - Business Combinations as an
integrated set of inputs and processes that are capable of generating outputs that have the ability to provide a return to its investors or owners. Typical inputs
include long-lived assets (including intangible assets or rights to use long-lived assets), intellectual property and the ability to obtain access to required resources.
Typical processes include strategic, operational and resource management processes that are typically documented or evident through an organized workforce.
We consider all of the above factors when determining whether a business was acquired (or divested) as well as the compound's development phase if no commercial
products are involved. For example, in evaluating our acquisitions of Cormorant and Padlock in 2016, Cardioxyl and Flexus in 2015 and iPierian in 2014, we concluded
that no significant processes were transferred to us, thus the transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions. As a result, the amounts allocated to the lead
investigational compounds were expensed and not capitalized. In addition, contingent consideration from potential development, regulatory, approval and sales-
based milestones and sales-based royalties were not included in the purchase price. Refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures"
for further discussion on our acquisitions.
Similarly, in evaluating our divestitures of our investigational HIV medicines business and the business comprising the alliance with Reckitt in 2016, Erbitux*,
Ixempra* and the businesses comprising the alliances with The Medicines Company and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. in 2015, and our diabetes
business to AstraZeneca in 2014 we concluded that all necessary inputs and processes were transferred, and consequently the transactions were accounted for as
sales of businesses, which resulted in the allocation of goodwill ($98 million in 2016, $73 million in 2015 and $600 million in 2014) to the carrying value of the
businesses in determining the gain on sale. Contingent proceeds related to divestitures are not recognized until realized.
Valuation processes are also required for certain multiple element arrangements and include determination of judgmental and complex matters, discussed above. For
example, BMS purchased a warrant in 2015 that gives BMS the exclusive right to acquire Promedior, which required the determination of the best estimated selling
price of the two separate elements identified in the transaction (the warrant and the clinical development services). Similarly, the divestiture of the diabetes business
to AstraZeneca in 2014 required the determination of the best estimated selling price of several elements including the business, supply and development agreements
(including the appropriate mark-ups) and the estimated fair value of the manufacturing facility. Refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 3. Alliances" for further
discussion on both transactions.
Impairment
Other Intangible Assets, including IPRD
Other intangible assets were $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016, including licenses ($248 million of which $155 million is allocated to unapproved products), developed
technology rights ($669 million), capitalized software ($361 million) and IPRD ($107 million). Intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever current facts or
circumstances warrant a review, although IPRD is assessed at least annually. Intangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly newly
acquired assets for recently launched products or IPRD. These assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the
valuations could potentially lead to impairment. Some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include competition, earlier than expected loss of
exclusivity, pricing pressures, adverse regulatory changes or clinical trial results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval and additional development costs,
inability to achieve expected synergies, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. The complexity in estimating the fair value of
intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation.
Considering the high risk nature of research and development and the industry’s success rate of bringing developmental compounds to market, IPRD impairment
charges are likely to occur in future periods. We recognized a $160 million charge in 2015 for BMS-986020 which was in Phase II development for treatment of IPF and
$343 million in 2014, including a $310 million charge for peginterferon lambda which was in Phase III development for treatment of HCV. For discussion on IPRD
impairments, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 13. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."
46Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment whenever current facts or circumstances require a review including whether it is more likely than not that the
asset will be disposed of prior to its estimated remaining useful life. Additionally, these long-lived assets are periodically reviewed to determine if any change in facts
or circumstances would result in a change to the estimated useful life of the asset, possibly resulting in the acceleration of depreciation. If such circumstances exist,
an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether
an impairment exists at its lowest level of identifiable cash flows. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the
asset’s fair value and its carrying value. Expectations of future cash flows are subject to change based upon the near and long-term production volumes and margins
generated by the asset as well as any potential alternative future use. Accelerated depreciation and other related charges for certain manufacturing and R&D facilities
were $104 million in 2016, $115 million in 2015 and $151 million in 2014. Additional charges will continue to occur as a result of the Company’s restructuring actions
announced in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Contingencies
In the normal course of business, we are subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, that cover a wide range of
matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, contractual claims and tax matters. We
recognize accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These estimates
are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates.
For discussions on contingencies, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 1. Accounting Policies—Contingencies,” “—Note 7. Income Taxes” and “—Note 18.
Legal Proceedings and Contingencies.”
Income Taxes
Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or
not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including long-range forecasts of future taxable income and evaluation of tax planning
initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. Our deferred tax assets were
$4.3 billion at December 31, 2016 (net of valuation allowances of $3.1 billion) and $4.1 billion at December 31, 2015 (net of valuation allowances of $3.5 billion).
Deferred tax assets related to a U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforward of $129 million and a U.S. Federal tax credit carryforward of $27 million were recognized at
December 31, 2016. The net operating loss carryforward expires in varying amounts beginning in 2022. The U.S. Federal tax credit carryforward expires in varying
amounts beginning in 2017. The realization of these carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient domestic-sourced taxable income prior to their expiration. An
$11 million valuation allowance was established for this item at December 31, 2016. Although not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax
assets not valued will be realized.
Taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be reinvested indefinitely offshore.
Prior to the Mead Johnson split-off in 2009, the following transactions occurred: (i) an internal spin-off of Mead Johnson shares while still owned by us;
(ii) conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares; and; (iii) conversion of Mead Johnson & Company to a limited liability company. These
transactions as well as the split-off of Mead Johnson through the exchange offer should qualify as tax-exempt transactions under the Internal Revenue Code based
upon a private letter ruling received from the Internal Revenue Service related to the conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares, and outside legal
opinions.
Certain assumptions, representations and covenants by Mead Johnson were relied upon regarding the future conduct of its business and other matters which could
affect the tax treatment of the exchange. For example, the current tax law generally creates a presumption that the exchange would be taxable to us, if Mead Johnson
or its shareholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change in its stock ownership during a four year period beginning two years before
the exchange offer, unless it is established that the exchange offer were not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership. If the
internal spin-off or exchange offer were determined not to qualify as a tax exempt transaction, the transaction could be subject to tax as if the exchange was a taxable
sale by us at market value.
47In addition, a negative basis or ELA existed in our investment in stock of Mead Johnson prior to these transactions. We received an opinion from outside legal
counsel to the effect that it is more likely than not that we eliminated the ELA as part of these transactions and do not have taxable income with respect to the ELA.
The tax law in this area is complex and it is possible that even if the internal spin-off and the exchange offer is tax exempt under the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS
could assert that we have additional taxable income for the period with respect to the ELA. We could be exposed to additional taxes if this were to occur. Based upon
our understanding of the Internal Revenue Code and opinion from outside legal counsel, a tax reserve of $244 million was established reducing the gain on disposal
of Mead Johnson included in discontinued operations in 2009.
We agreed to certain tax related indemnities with Mead Johnson as set forth in the tax sharing agreement, including certain taxes related to its business prior to the
completion of the IPO and created as part of the restructuring to facilitate the IPO. Mead Johnson has also agreed to indemnify us for potential tax effects resulting
from the breach of certain representations discussed above as well as certain transactions related to the acquisition of Mead Johnson’s stock or assets.
Liabilities are established for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax
credits and deductibility of certain expenses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted
over time as more information becomes known. For example, additional reserves of $123 million were established in 2014 for certain transfer pricing matters related to
periods from 2008 through 2014.
For discussions on income taxes, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 1. Accounting Policies—Income Taxes” and “—Note 7. Income Taxes.”
Product and Pipeline Developments
Our R&D programs are managed on a portfolio basis from early discovery through late-stage development and include a balance of early-stage and late-stage
programs to support future growth. Our late stage R&D programs in Phase III development include both investigational compounds for initial indications and
additional indications or formulations for marketed products. Spending on these programs represent approximately 30-45% of our annual R&D expenses in the last
three years. No individual investigational compound or marketed product represented 10% or more of our R&D expenses in any of the last three years, except Opdivo
in both 2016 and 2015. Our late-stage development programs could potentially have an impact on our revenue and earnings within the next few years if regulatory
approvals are obtained and products are successfully commercialized. The following are the developments in our marketed products and our late-stage pipeline:

50Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This annual report on Form 10-K (including documents incorporated by reference) and other written and oral statements we make from time to time contain certain
“forward-looking” statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can
identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as “should”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “target”, “may”, “project”, “guidance”,
“intend”, “plan”, “believe” and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial
performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking
statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could
cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, our goals, plans and projections
regarding our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or
results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results, which are based on current
expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several
years. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly under “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” that
we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement.
Although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements
can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to
release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
51Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
We are exposed to market risk resulting from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. Certain derivative financial instruments are used when available
on a cost-effective basis to hedge our underlying economic exposure. All of our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk
considered as part of the overall fair value measurement. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading purposes.
Foreign Exchange Risk
Significant amounts of our revenues, earnings and cash flow are exposed to changes in foreign currency rates. Our primary net foreign currency translation exposures
are the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi. Foreign currency forward contracts used to manage risk which primarily arises from certain intercompany purchase
transactions are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges when appropriate. In addition, we are exposed to foreign exchange transaction risk arising from
non-functional currency denominated assets and liabilities and earnings denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Foreign currency forward contracts used to offset
these exposures are not designated as hedges.
We estimate that a 10% appreciation in the underlying currencies being hedged from their levels against the U.S. dollar (with all other variables held constant) would
decrease the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts by $86 million at December 31, 2016, reducing earnings over the remaining life of the contracts.
We are also exposed to translation risk on non-U.S. dollar-denominated net assets. Non-U.S. dollar borrowings are used to hedge the foreign currency exposures of
our net investment in certain foreign affiliates and are designated as hedges of net investments. The effective portion of foreign exchange gains or losses on these
hedges is included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). If our net investment decreases below the
equivalent value of the non-U.S. debt borrowings, the change in the remeasurement basis of the debt would be subject to recognition in income as changes occur.
For additional information, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 9. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements.”
Interest Rate Risk
We use fixed-to-floating interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges and forward starting interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow
hedges as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. These contracts are intended to provide us with an appropriate balance of fixed and floating rate debt,
and forward starting swap contracts are used to manage the interest rate of future debt issuances. We estimate that an increase of 100 basis points in short-term or
long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts by $36 million, or a decrease of 100 basis points in short-term or long-term
interest rates would decrease the fair value of our forward starting interest rate swap contracts by $125 million, thereby reducing earnings over the remaining life of
the contracts.
We estimate that an increase of 100 basis points in long-term interest rates would decrease the fair value of long-term debt by $513 million. Our marketable securities
are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors. Our policy is to invest only in institutions that meet high credit
quality standards. We estimate that an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates in general would decrease the fair value of our debt investment portfolio by
approximately $68 million.
Credit Risk
Although not material, certain European government-backed entities with a higher risk of default, such as Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain, are monitored through
economic factors, including credit ratings, credit-default swap rates, debt-to-gross domestic product ratios and other entity specific factors. Historically, our exposure
was limited by factoring receivables. Our credit exposures in Europe may increase in the future due to reductions in our factoring arrangements and the ongoing
sovereign debt crisis.
We monitor our investments with counterparties with the objective of minimizing concentrations of credit risk. Our investment policy establishes limits on the amount
and time to maturity of investments with any individual counterparty. The policy also requires that investments are only entered into with corporate and financial
institutions that meet high credit quality standards.
The use of derivative instruments exposes us to credit risk. When the fair value of a derivative instrument contract is positive, we are exposed to credit risk if the
counterparty fails to perform. When the fair value of a derivative instrument contract is negative, the counterparty is exposed to credit risk if we fail to perform our
obligation. Collateral is not required by any party whether derivatives are in an asset or liability position. We have a policy of diversifying derivatives with
counterparties to mitigate the overall risk of counterparty defaults. For additional information, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 9. Financial Instruments
and Fair Value Measurements.”

55Note 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, including the accounts of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and all of its controlled
majority-owned subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Material subsequent events are
evaluated and disclosed through the report issuance date. Refer to the Summary of Abbreviated Terms at the end of this 2016 Form 10-K for terms used throughout
the document.
Alliance and license arrangements are assessed to determine whether the terms provide economic or other control over the entity requiring consolidation of an entity.
Entities controlled by means other than a majority voting interest are referred to as variable interest entities and are consolidated when BMS has both the power to
direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impacts its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive
benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity.
Use of Estimates and Judgments
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of management estimates, judgments and assumptions. The most significant assumptions are estimates in
determining the fair value and potential impairment of intangible assets; sales rebate and return accruals; legal contingencies; income taxes; estimated selling prices
used in multiple element arrangements; determining if an acquisition or divestiture is a business or an asset; and pension and postretirement benefits. Actual results
may differ from estimated results.
Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassifications provide a more concise financial statement
presentation and additional information is disclosed in the notes if material.

Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and title and
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are transferred, generally at time of shipment (including the supply of commercial products to alliance partners when
they are the principal in the end customer sale). However, certain revenue of non-U.S. businesses is recognized on the date of receipt by the customer. Alliance and
other revenue related to Abilify* and Atripla* is not recognized until the products are sold to the end customer by the alliance partner. Royalties are recognized when
the third-party sales are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured. Refer to “—Note 3. Alliances” for further detail regarding alliances.
Revenue is reduced at the time of recognition for expected sales returns, discounts, rebates and sales allowances based on historical experience updated for changes
in facts and circumstances including the impact of applicable healthcare legislation. Revenue is deferred when there is no historical experience with products in a
similar therapeutic category or with similar operational characteristics, or until the right of return no longer exists or sufficient historical experience to estimate sales
returns is developed.
56Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from
differences between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. Valuation
allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a
valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the long-range forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning
initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made.
Tax benefits are recognized from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing
authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements for a particular tax position is based on the largest
benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include bank deposits, time deposits, commercial paper and money market funds. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase and are recognized at cost, which approximates fair value.
Marketable Securities and Investments in Other Companies
Marketable securities are classified as “available-for-sale” on the date of purchase and reported at fair value. Fair value is determined based on observable market
quotes or valuation models using assessments of counterparty credit worthiness, credit default risk or underlying security and overall capital market liquidity.
Investments in 50% or less owned companies are accounted for using the equity method of accounting when the ability to exercise significant influence is
maintained. The share of net income or losses of equity investments is included in other (income)/expense. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment by
assessing if the decline in market value of the investment below the carrying value is other than temporary, which considers the intent and ability to retain the
investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, the duration and extent that the market value has been less than cost
and the investee's financial condition.
Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
Expenditures for additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized at cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives
of the related assets ranging from 20 to 50 years for buildings and 3 to 20 years for machinery, equipment and fixtures.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Current facts or circumstances are periodically evaluated to determine if the carrying value of depreciable assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such
circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows generated by the long-lived asset, or appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying
value to determine whether an impairment exists at its lowest level of identifiable cash flows. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on
the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset’s fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets, if
available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques using unobservable fair value inputs, such as a
discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
Capitalized Software
Eligible costs to obtain internal use software are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software.
57Acquisitions
Businesses acquired are consolidated upon obtaining control. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at the date of acquisition. Any
excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Business acquisition costs are expensed when
incurred. Contingent consideration from potential development, regulatory, approval and sales-based milestones and sales-based royalties are included in the
purchase price for business combinations and are excluded for asset acquisitions. Amounts allocated to the lead investigational compounds for asset acquisitions
are expensed at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill, Acquired In-Process Research and Development and Other Intangible Assets
The fair value of intangible assets is typically determined using the “income method” utilizing Level 3 fair value inputs. The market participant valuations assume a
global view considering all potential jurisdictions and indications based on discounted after-tax cash flow projections, risk adjusted for estimated probability of
technical and regulatory success (for IPRD).
Finite-lived intangible assets, including licenses, developed technology rights and IPRD projects that reach commercialization are amortized on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful life. Estimated useful lives are determined considering the period the assets are expected to contribute to future cash flows.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment by assessing qualitative factors or performing a quantitative analysis in determining whether it is more likely than
not that the fair value of net assets are below their carrying amounts. Examples of qualitative factors assessed in 2016 include our share price, financial performance
compared to budgets, long-term financial plans, macroeconomic, industry and market conditions as well as the substantial excess of fair value over the carrying value
of net assets from the annual impairment test performed in a prior year. Each relevant factor is assessed both individually and in the aggregate.
IPRD is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate a potential reduction in the fair
values of the assets below their carrying value. If the carrying value of IPRD is determined to exceed the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.
Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. If the
carrying value exceeds the projected undiscounted pretax cash flows of the intangible asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the
estimated fair value (discounted after-tax cash flows) is recognized.
Restructuring
Restructuring charges are recognized as a result of actions to streamline operations and rationalize manufacturing facilities. Estimating the impact of restructuring
plans, including future termination benefits and other exit costs requires judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates.
Contingencies
Loss contingencies from legal proceedings and claims may occur from a wide range of matters, including government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product
and environmental liability, contractual claims and tax matters. Accruals are recognized when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can
be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies (including contingent proceeds related to the divestitures) are not recognized until realized. Legal fees are expensed as
incurred.
Shipping and Handling Costs
Shipping and handling costs are included in marketing, selling and administrative expenses and were $70 million in 2016, $85 million in 2015 and $115 million in 2014.
Advertising and Product Promotion Costs
Advertising and product promotion costs are included in marketing, selling and administrative expenses and were $789 million in 2016, $825 million in 2015 and $734
million in 2014. Advertising and product promotion costs are expensed as incurred.
Foreign Currency Translation
Foreign subsidiary earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using
current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in OCI.
58Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical study costs are accrued over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjusted as
necessary based upon an ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred. Strategic alliances with third parties provide licensing rights to develop,
manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products, the rights to which are owned by the other party. Research and development is recognized net of
reimbursements in connection with alliance agreements. Upfront and contingent milestone payments for asset acquisitions of investigational compounds are also
included in research and development expenses.
Cash Flow
Upfront and contingent milestone payments for licensing of investigational compounds are included in operating activities and asset or business acquisitions are
included in investing activities. Divestiture proceeds are included in investing activities as well as royalties and other consideration received subsequent to the
related sale of the asset or business. Other adjustments reflected in operating activities include divestiture gains and losses and related royalties, research and
development asset acquisition charges, gains and losses on debt redemption and changes in the fair value of written option liabilities.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In May 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it
expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The new standard and its subsequent amendments that were issued will replace
most of the existing revenue recognition standards in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective on January 1, 2018. A five step model will be utilized to achieve the core
principle; (1) identify the customer contract, (2) identify the contract’s performance obligation, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to
the performance obligation and (5) recognize revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied. The new standard can be applied retrospectively to each prior
reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of the change recognized at the date of the initial application in retained earnings. Disclosures
regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from customer contracts will also be required.
The Company’s assessment of the new standard’s impact is substantially complete based on our current contracts. We currently believe the timing of recognizing
revenue for the typical net product sale to our customers will not significantly change. However, the new standard will no longer require the transaction price to be
fixed or determinable and certain variable consideration might be recognized prior to the occurrence or resolution of the contingent event (subject to a revenue
reversal constraint). As a result, certain revenue previously deferred under the current standard because the transaction price was not fixed or determinable (e.g. early
access programs) will be accounted for as variable consideration and might be recognized earlier provided such terms are sufficient to reliably estimate the ultimate
price expected to be realized.
In addition, future royalties related to certain alliance arrangements (e.g. Sanofi and Japan Erbitux* arrangements disclosed in "—Note 3. Alliances") will be
estimated and recognized prior to the third party sale occurring provided it is not probable that the estimated amounts would be reversed in the future. However, the
timing of royalties, sales-based milestones and other forms of contingent consideration resulting from the divestiture of businesses (e.g. the diabetes and North
American Erbitux* businesses disclosed in "—Note 3. Alliances") as well as royalties and sales-based royalties from licensing arrangements is not expected to
change. The new standard’s guidance pertaining to the separation of licensing rights and related fee recognition is not expected to significantly change the timing of
recognizing revenue in our existing alliance arrangements that are currently generating revenue.
The Company currently anticipates to adopt the new standard on a modified retrospective basis with the cumulative effect of the change reflected in retained
earnings as of January 1, 2018 and not restate prior periods. As a result, certain future royalties discussed above will be estimated and presented as a cumulative
effect of an accounting change and excluded from the results of operations beginning in 2018 (other than subsequent significant revisions to the estimated amounts).
Variable consideration pertaining to similar arrangements entered into subsequent to the adoption of the new standard will also need to be estimated and accounted
for in a comparable manner but the initial estimate will be reflected in revenue and assessed each subsequent reporting period. No significant changes to business
processes, systems and controls are currently expected to be required.
In January 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures of financial instruments effective January 1,
2018 with early adoption not permitted. The new guidance requires that fair value adjustments for equity securities with readily determinable fair values currently
classified as available-for-sale be reported through earnings. The new guidance also requires a qualitative impairment assessment for equity investments without a
readily determinable fair value and a charge through earnings if an impairment exists. The Company does not expect the amended standard to have a material impact
on the Company’s results of operations.
59In February 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance on lease accounting. The amended guidance requires the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease
liability, initially measured at the present value of future lease payments for leases with a term longer than 12 months. The guidance is effective beginning in 2019 with
early adoption permitted on a modified retrospective approach. Although the Company’s assessment of the amended standard has not been completed, minimal
impacts to the results of operations are expected. The undiscounted value of lease obligations is approximately $800 million at December 31, 2016, consisting primarily
of facility leases accounted for as operating leases. The initial right-of-use asset and lease liability amount reflected upon adoption will be subject to several factors
including the actual lease portfolio from the earliest date of initial application, selection of an appropriate discount rate and determining the individual fixed lease
payments and terms including renewal periods reasonably certain to occur.
In March 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance for share-based payment transactions. Excess tax benefits and deficiencies will be recognized in the consolidated
statement of earnings rather than capital in excess of par value of stock on a prospective basis. A policy election will be available to account for forfeitures as they
occur, with the cumulative effect of the change recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings at the date of adoption. Excess tax benefits within the consolidated
statement of cash flows will be presented as an operating activity (prospective or retrospective application) and cash payments to tax authorities in connection with
shares withheld for statutory tax withholding requirements will be presented as a financing activity (retrospective application). The guidance is effective beginning in
2017. The expected reduction of income tax expense for excess tax benefits in 2017 is not expected to be material. The Company will continue its current practice
relating to accounting for forfeitures. The cash flow presentation changes discussed above will increase net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used
in financing activities by $208 million in 2016 and $273 million in 2015.
In June 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments. Entities will be required to use a forward-looking
estimated loss model. Available-for-sale debt security credit losses will be recognized as allowances rather than a reduction in amortized cost. The guidance is
effective beginning in 2020 with early adoption permitted in 2019 on a modified retrospective approach. The Company does not expect the amended standard to have
a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.
In October 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance on income tax accounting for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The amended guidance
requires that the tax consequences of transfers of assets between members of a consolidated group be recognized in the period the transfer takes place (excluding
inventory). The guidance is effective beginning in 2018 with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017 on a modified retrospective approach. The Company
will early adopt the amended standard beginning in the first quarter of 2017. As a result, prepaid receivables and deferred tax assets attributed to internal intellectual
property transfers of approximately $1 billion will be reduced as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in retained earnings and no longer amortized as a
component of income taxes ($86 million per year). In addition, the tax impact of future internal transfers of intellectual property will be included in income tax expense
when transferred and not amortized in subsequent periods.
In January 2017, the FASB issued amended guidance that revises the definition of a business. The amendments provide an initial screen that when substantially all of
the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the assets would not
represent a business. To be considered a business, there must be an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create
outputs. To be a business without outputs, there will need to be an organized workforce. The amendments also narrow the definition of the term outputs. The
guidance is effective beginning in 2018 with early adoption permitted prospectively. The Company is assessing the potential impact of the amended standard.
In January 2017, the FASB issued amended guidance that simplifies the recognition and measurement of a goodwill impairment loss by eliminating Step 2 of the
quantitative impairment test. As a result, impairment charges will be required for the amount by which the reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value up to
the amount of its allocated goodwill. The guidance is effective on a prospective basis in 2020, with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment
tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Company does not expect the amended standard to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.
60Note 2. BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION
BMS operates in a single segment engaged in the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of innovative medicines that
help patients prevail over serious diseases. A global research and development organization and supply chain organization are responsible for the discovery,
development, manufacturing and supply of products. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell the products. The business is also supported by
global corporate staff functions. Segment information is consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by the chief executive officer for purposes of
evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting future periods.
Products are sold principally to wholesalers, and to a lesser extent, directly to distributors, retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. Gross
revenues to the three largest pharmaceutical wholesalers in the U.S. as a percentage of global gross revenues were as follows:
2016 2015 2014

Note 3. ALLIANCES
BMS enters into collaboration arrangements with third parties for the development and commercialization of certain products. Although each of these arrangements
is unique in nature, both parties are active participants in the operating activities of the collaboration and exposed to significant risks and rewards depending on the
commercial success of the activities. BMS may either in-license intellectual property owned by the other party or out-license its intellectual property to the other
party. These arrangements also typically include research, development, manufacturing, and/or commercial activities and can cover a single investigational
compound or commercial product or multiple compounds and/or products in various life cycle stages. The rights and obligations of the parties can be global or
limited to geographic regions. We refer to these collaborations as alliances and our partners as alliance partners. Several products such as Empliciti, Erbitux*,
Opdivo, Sprycel, Yervoy, Eliquis, Orencia, Sustiva (Atripla*) and Abilify* as well as products comprising the diabetes alliance discussed below and certain mature
and other brands were included in alliance arrangements.
Payments between alliance partners are accounted for and presented in the results of operations after considering the specific nature of the payment and the
underlying activities to which the payments relate. Multiple alliance activities, including the transfer of rights, are only separated into individual units of accounting if
they have standalone value from other activities that occur over the life of the arrangements. In these situations, the arrangement consideration is allocated to the
activities or rights on a relative selling price basis. If multiple alliance activities or rights do not have standalone value, they are combined into a single unit of
accounting.
The most common activities between BMS and its alliance partners are presented in results of operations as follows:
• When BMS is the principal in the end customer sale, 100% of product sales are included in net product sales. When BMS's alliance partner is the principal in
the end customer sale, BMS's contractual share of the third-party sales and/or royalty income are included in alliance revenue as the sale of commercial
products are considered part of BMS's ongoing major or central operations. Refer to "Revenue Recognition" included in "—Note 1. Accounting Policies"
for information regarding recognition criteria.
• Amounts payable to BMS by alliance partners (who are the principal in the end customer sale) for supply of commercial products are included in alliance
revenue as the sale of commercial products are considered part of BMS's ongoing major or central operations.
• Profit sharing, royalties and other sales-based fees payable by BMS to alliance partners are included in cost of products sold as incurred.
• Cost reimbursements between the parties are recognized as incurred and included in cost of products sold; marketing, selling and administrative expenses;
or research and development expenses, based on the underlying nature of the related activities subject to reimbursement.
• Upfront and contingent development and approval milestones payable to BMS by alliance partners for investigational compounds and commercial products
are deferred and amortized over the shorter of the contractual term or the periods in which the related compounds or products are expected to contribute to
future cash flows. The amortization is presented consistent with the nature of the payment under the arrangement. For example, amounts received for
investigational compounds are presented in other (income)/expense as the activities being performed at that time are not related to the sale of commercial
products that are part of BMS’s ongoing major or central operations; amounts received for commercial products are presented in alliance revenue as the sale
of commercial products are considered part of BMS’s ongoing major or central operations (except for the AstraZeneca alliance pertaining to the Amylin
products - see further discussion under the specific AstraZeneca alliance disclosure herein).
• Upfront and contingent approval milestones payable by BMS to alliance partners for commercial products are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of
the contractual term or the periods in which the related products are expected to contribute to future cash flows. The amortization is included in cost of
products sold.
• Upfront and contingent milestones payable by BMS to alliance partners prior to regulatory approval are expensed as incurred and included in research and
development expenses.
• Royalties and other contingent consideration payable to BMS by alliance partners related to the divestiture of such businesses are included in other income
when earned.
62• Equity in net income of affiliates is included in other (income)/expense.
• All payments between BMS and its alliance partners are presented in cash flows from operating activities, except as otherwise described below.
Selected financial information pertaining to our alliances was as follows, including net product sales when BMS is the principal in the third-party customer sale for
products subject to the alliance. Expenses summarized below do not include all amounts attributed to the activities for the products in the alliance, but only the
payments between the alliance partners or the related amortization if the payments were deferred or capitalized.

Pfizer
BMS and Pfizer are parties to a worldwide co-development and co-commercialization agreement for Eliquis, an anticoagulant discovered by BMS. Pfizer funds
between 50% and 60% of all development costs depending on the study. Profits and losses are shared equally on a global basis except in certain countries where
Pfizer commercializes Eliquis and pays BMS compensation based on a percentage of net sales.
Upon entering into the agreement, co-exclusive license rights for the product were granted to Pfizer in exchange for an upfront payment and potential milestone
payments. Both parties assumed certain obligations to actively participate in the alliance and actively participate in a joint executive committee and various other
operating committees and have joint responsibilities for the research, development, distribution, sales and marketing activities of the alliance using resources in their
own infrastructures. BMS manufactures the product in the alliance and is the principal in the end customer product sales in the U.S., significant countries in Europe,
as well as Canada, Australia, China, Japan and South Korea. In 2015, BMS transferred full commercialization rights to Pfizer in certain smaller countries in order to
simplify operations. In the transferred countries, BMS supplies the product to Pfizer at cost plus a percentage of the net sales to end-customers.
The Company determined the rights transferred to Pfizer did not have standalone value as such rights were not sold separately by BMS or any other party, nor could
Pfizer receive any benefit for the delivered rights without the fulfillment of other ongoing obligations by BMS under the alliance agreement, including the exclusive
supply arrangement. As such, the global alliance was treated as a single unit of accounting and upfront proceeds and any subsequent contingent milestone proceeds
are amortized over the life of the related product.
63BMS received $884 million in non-refundable upfront, milestone and other licensing payments related to Eliquis through December 31, 2016. Amortization of the
Eliquis deferred income is included in other income as Eliquis was not a commercial product at the commencement of the alliance.

Gilead
BMS and Gilead have joint ventures in the U.S. (for the U.S. and Canada) and in Europe to develop and commercialize Atripla* (efavirenz 600 mg/ emtricitabine 200
mg/ tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), combining Sustiva, a product of BMS, and Truvada* (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), a product of Gilead.
The joint ventures are consolidated by Gilead.
Both parties actively participate in a joint executive committee and various other operating committees with direct oversight over the activities of the joint ventures.
The joint ventures purchase Sustiva and Truvada* API in bulk form from the parties and complete the finishing of Atripla*. The joint ventures or Gilead sell and
distribute Atripla* and are the principal in the end customer product sales. The parties no longer coordinate joint promotional activities.
Alliance revenue recognized for Atripla* include only the bulk efavirenz component of Atripla* which is based on the relative ratio of the average respective net
selling prices of Truvada* and Sustiva. Alliance revenue is deferred and the related alliance receivable is not recognized until the combined product is sold to third-
party customers.
In Europe, following the 2013 loss of exclusivity of Sustiva and effective January 1, 2014, the percentage of Atripla* net sales in Europe recognized by BMS is equal
to the difference between the average net selling prices of Atripla* and Truvada*. This alliance will continue in Europe until either party terminates the arrangement
or the last patent expires that allows market exclusivity to Atripla*.
In the U.S., the agreement may be terminated by Gilead upon the launch of a generic version of Sustiva or by BMS upon the launch of a generic version of Truvada*
or its individual components. The loss of exclusivity in the U.S. for Sustiva is expected in December 2017. In the event Gilead terminates the agreement upon the loss
of exclusivity for Sustiva, BMS will receive a quarterly royalty payment for 36 months following termination. Such payment in the first 12 months following
termination is equal to 55% of Atripla* net sales multiplied by the ratio of the difference in the average net selling prices of Atripla* and Truvada* to the Atripla*
average net selling price. In the second and third years following termination, the payment to BMS is reduced to 35% and 15%, respectively, of Atripla* net sales
multiplied by the price ratio described above. BMS will continue to supply Sustiva at cost plus a markup to the joint ventures during this three-year period, unless
either party elects to terminate the supply arrangement.

Otsuka
BMS has a worldwide commercialization agreement with Otsuka, to co-develop and co-promote Abilify*, excluding certain Asian countries. The U.S. portion of the
agreement expired in April 2015. The agreement expired in all EU countries in June 2014 and in each other non-U.S. country where we have the exclusive right to sell
Abilify*, the agreement expires on the later of April 20, 2015 or loss of exclusivity in any such country.
Both parties actively participated in joint executive governance and operating committees. Otsuka was responsible for providing all sales force efforts in the U.S.
effective January 2013, however, BMS was responsible for certain operating expenses up to various annual limits. BMS purchased the API from Otsuka and
completed the manufacturing of the product for subsequent sale to third-party customers in the U.S. and certain other countries. Otsuka assumed responsibility for
providing and funding sales force efforts in the EU effective April 2013. BMS also provided certain other services including distribution, customer management and
pharmacovigilance. BMS is the principal for the end customer product sales where it is the exclusive distributor for or has an exclusive right to sell Abilify*. Otsuka
was the principal for the end customer product sales in the U.S. and in the EU.
Alliance revenue only includes BMS’s share of total net sales to third-party customers in these territories. An assessment of BMS's expected annual contractual
share was completed each quarterly reporting period and adjusted based upon reported U.S. Abilify* net sales at year end. BMS's annual contractual share was 50%
in 2015 and 33% in 2014. The alliance revenue recognized in any interim period or quarter did not exceed the amounts that were due under the contract.
BMS’s contractual share of third-party net sales was 65% in the EU. In these countries and the U.S., alliance revenue was recognized when Abilify* was shipped and
all risks and rewards of ownership had been transferred to third-party customers.
BMS and Otsuka also have an alliance for Sprycel in the U.S., Japan and the EU (the Oncology Territory). Both parties co-promote the product in the U.S. and EU. In
February 2015, the co-promotion agreement with Otsuka was terminated in Japan. Both parties actively participate in various governance committees, however, BMS
has control over the decision making. BMS is responsible for the development and manufacture of the product and is also the principal in the end customer product
sales. Ixempra* (ixabepilone) was included in the above alliance prior to BMS's divestiture of that business in 2015. A fee is paid to Otsuka based on the following
percentages of combined annual net sales of Sprycel and Ixempra* in the Oncology Territory (including post divestiture Ixempra* sales):
% of Net Sales
2010 - 2012 2013 - 2020
$0 to $400 million 30% 65%
$400 million to $600 million 5% 12%
$600 million to $800 million 3% 3%
$800 million to $1.0 billion 2% 2%
In excess of $1.0 billion 1% 1%
During these annual periods, Otsuka contributes 20% of the first $175 million of certain commercial operational expenses relating to the Oncology Products in the
Oncology Territory and 1% of such costs in excess of $175 million.

Lilly
BMS had a commercialization agreement with Lilly through Lilly’s subsidiary ImClone for the co-development and promotion of Erbitux* in the U.S., Canada and
Japan. Both parties actively participated in a joint executive committee and various other operating committees and shared responsibilities for research and
development using resources in their own infrastructures. Lilly manufactured bulk requirements for Erbitux* in its own facilities and filling and finishing was
performed by a third party for which BMS had oversight responsibility. BMS had exclusive distribution rights in North America and was responsible for promotional
efforts in North America although Lilly had the right to co-promote in the U.S. at their own expense. BMS was the principal in the end customer product sales in
North America and paid Lilly a distribution fee for 39% of Erbitux* net sales in North America plus a share of certain royalties paid by Lilly. BMS’s rights and
obligations with respect to the commercialization of Erbitux* in North America would have expired in September 2018.
In October 2015, BMS transferred its rights to Erbitux* in North America to Lilly in exchange for sales-based royalties as described below. The transferred rights
include, but are not limited to, full commercialization and manufacturing responsibilities. The transaction was accounted for as a business divestiture and resulted in a
non-cash charge of $171 million for intangible assets directly related to the business and an allocation of goodwill.
BMS will receive royalties through September 2018, which is included in other income when earned. The royalty rates applicable to North America are 38% on
Erbitux* net sales up to $165 million in 2015, $650 million in 2016, $650 million in 2017 and $480 million in 2018, plus 20% on net sales in excess of those amounts in
each of the respective years. Royalties earned were $227 million in 2016 and $56 million in 2015.
BMS shared rights to Erbitux* in Japan under an agreement with Lilly and Merck KGaA and received 50% of the pretax profit from Merck KGaA’s net sales of
Erbitux* in Japan which was further shared equally with Lilly. BMS transferred its co-commercialization rights in Japan to Merck KGaA in 2015 in exchange for sales-
based royalties through 2032 which is included in other income when earned. Royalties earned were $19 million in 2016 and $14 million in 2015.

AstraZeneca
Prior to the diabetes business divestiture discussed below, BMS had an alliance with AstraZeneca consisting of three worldwide co-development and
commercialization agreements covering (1) Onglyza* and related combination products sold under various names, (2) Farxiga* and related combination products
and, (3) beginning in August 2012 after BMS's acquisition of Amylin, Amylin's portfolio of products including Bydureon*, Byetta*, Symlin* and Myalept*, as well as
certain assets owned by Amylin, including a manufacturing facility located in West Chester, Ohio.
Co-exclusive license rights for the product or products underlying each agreement were granted to AstraZeneca in exchange for an upfront payment and potential
milestone payments, and both parties assumed certain obligations to actively participate in the alliance. Both parties actively participated in a joint executive
committee and various other operating committees and had joint responsibilities for the research, development, distribution, sales and marketing activities of the
alliance using resources in their own infrastructures. BMS manufactured the products in all three alliances and was the principal in the end customer product sales in
substantially all countries.
For each alliance agreement, the rights transferred to AstraZeneca did not have standalone value as such rights were not sold separately by BMS or any other party,
nor could AstraZeneca have received any benefit for the delivered rights without the fulfillment of other ongoing obligations by BMS under the alliance agreements,
including the exclusive supply arrangement. As such, each global alliance was treated as a single unit of accounting. As a result, upfront proceeds and any
subsequent contingent milestone proceeds were amortized over the life of the related products.
In 2012, BMS received a $3.6 billion non-refundable, upfront payment from AstraZeneca in consideration for entering into the Amylin alliance. In 2013, AstraZeneca
exercised its option for equal governance rights over certain key strategic and financial decisions regarding the Amylin alliance and paid BMS $135 million as
consideration. These payments were accounted for as deferred income and amortized based on the relative fair value of the predominant elements included in the
alliance over their estimated useful lives (intangible assets related to Bydureon* with an estimated useful life of 13 years, Byetta* with an estimated useful life of 7
years, Symlin* with an estimated life of 9 years, Myalept* with an estimated useful life of 12 years, and the Amylin manufacturing plant with an estimated useful life
of 15 years). The amortization was presented as a reduction to cost of products sold because the alliance assets were acquired shortly before the commencement of
the alliance and AstraZeneca was entitled to share in the proceeds from the sale of any of the assets. The amortization of the acquired Amylin intangible assets and
manufacturing plant was also presented in cost of products sold. BMS was entitled to reimbursements for 50% of capital expenditures related to the acquired Amylin
manufacturing facility. BMS and AstraZeneca also shared in certain tax attributes related to the Amylin alliance.
Prior to the termination of the alliance, BMS received non-refundable upfront, milestone and other licensing payments of $300 million related to Onglyza* and $250
million related to Farxiga*. Amortization of the Onglyza* and Farxiga* deferred income was included in other income as Onglyza* and Farxiga* were not
commercial products at the commencement of the alliance. Both parties also shared most commercialization and development expenses equally, as well as profits and
losses.
67In February 2014, BMS and AstraZeneca terminated their alliance agreements and BMS sold to AstraZeneca substantially all of the diabetes business comprising the
alliance. The divestiture included the shares of Amylin and the resulting transfer of its Ohio manufacturing facility; the intellectual property related to Onglyza* and
Farxiga* (including BMS's interest in the out-licensing agreement for Onglyza* in Japan); and the purchase of BMS’s manufacturing facility located in Mount
Vernon, Indiana in 2015. Substantially all employees dedicated to the diabetes business were transferred to AstraZeneca.
BMS and AstraZeneca entered into several agreements in connection with the sale, including a supply agreement, a development agreement and a transitional
services agreement. Under those agreements, BMS is obligated to supply certain products, including the active product ingredients for Onglyza* and Farxiga*
through 2020; to perform ongoing development activities for certain clinical trial programs substantially through 2016; and to provide transitional services such as
accounting, financial services, customer service, distribution, regulatory, development, information technology and certain other administrative services for various
periods in order to facilitate the orderly transfer of the business operations.
Consideration for the transaction includes a $2.7 billion payment at closing; contingent regulatory and sales-based milestone payments of up to $1.4 billion (including
$800 million related to approval milestones and $600 million related to sales-based milestones, payable in 2020); royalty payments based on net sales through 2025
and payments up to $225 million if and when certain assets are transferred to AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca will also pay BMS for any required product supply at a price
approximating the product cost as well as negotiated transitional service fees.
Royalty rates on net sales are as follows:
2020 -
2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2025
Onglyza* and Farxiga* Worldwide Net Sales up to $500 million 44% 35% 27% 12% 20% 22% 14-25%
Onglyza* and Farxiga* Worldwide Net Sales over $500 million 3% 7% 9% 12% 20% 22% 14-25%
Amylin products U.S. Net Sales — 2% 2% 5% 10% 12% 5-12%
The stock and asset purchase agreement contained multiple elements to be delivered subsequent to the closing of the transaction, including the China diabetes
business (transferred in 2014), the Mount Vernon, Indiana manufacturing facility (transferred in 2015), and the activities under the development and supply
agreements. Each of these elements was determined to have a standalone value. As a result, a portion of the consideration received at closing was allocated to the
undelivered elements using the relative selling price method after determining the best estimated selling price for each element. The remaining amount of
consideration was included in the calculation for the gain on sale of the diabetes business. Contingent milestone and royalty payments are similarly allocated among
the underlying elements if and when the amounts are determined to be payable to BMS. Amounts allocated to the sale of the business are immediately recognized in
the results of operations. Amounts allocated to the other elements are recognized in the results of operations only to the extent each element has been delivered.
Consideration of $3.8 billion was accounted for in 2014 (including royalties and $700 million of contingent regulatory milestone payments related to the approval of
Farxiga* in both the U.S. and Japan). Approximately $3.3 billion of the consideration was allocated to the sale of the business and the remaining $492 million was
allocated to the undelivered elements described above. The consideration includes $235 million of earned royalties, including $192 million allocated to elements that
were delivered. The gain on sale of the diabetes business was $536 million, including $292 million during the third quarter of 2014 resulting primarily from the transfer
of the China diabetes business to AstraZeneca. The gain was based on the difference between the consideration allocated to the sale of the business excluding
royalties (net of transaction fees) and the carrying value of the diabetes business net assets (including a $600 million allocation of goodwill and the reversal of $821
million of net deferred tax liabilities attributed to Amylin). Consideration of $179 million was received in 2015 for the transfer of the Mount Vernon, Indiana
manufacturing facility and related inventories resulting in a gain of $79 million for the amounts allocated to the delivered elements.
Consideration allocated to the development and supply agreements are amortized over the applicable service periods. Amortization of deferred income attributed to
the development agreement was included in other income as the sale of these services are not considered part of BMS’s ongoing major or central operations.
Revenues attributed to the supply agreement were included in alliance revenues.
Consideration for the transaction is presented for cash flow purposes based on the allocation process described above, either as an investing activity if attributed to
the sale of the business or related assets or as an operating activity if attributed to the transitional services, supply arrangement or development agreement.
In September 2015, BMS transferred a percentage of its future royalty rights on Amylin net product sales in the U.S. to CPPIB. The transferred rights represent
approximately 70% of potential future royalties BMS is entitled to in 2019 to 2025. In exchange for the transfer, BMS will receive an additional tiered-based royalty on
Amylin net product sales in the U.S. from CPPIB in 2016 through 2018. These royalties are presented in other income and were $134 million in 2016.

Sanofi
BMS and Sanofi have co-development and co-commercialization agreements for Plavix* and Avapro*/Avalide*. Effective January 1, 2013, Sanofi assumed
essentially all of the worldwide operations of the alliance with the exception of Plavix* in the U.S. and Puerto Rico where BMS is the operating partner with a 50.1%
controlling interest. In exchange for the rights transferred to Sanofi, BMS receives quarterly royalties from January 1, 2013 until December 31, 2018 and a terminal
payment from Sanofi of $200 million at the end of 2018.
Royalties received from Sanofi in the territory covering the Americas and Australia, opt-out markets, and former development royalties are presented in alliance
revenues and were $195 million in 2016, $211 million in 2015 and $223 million in 2014. Royalties attributed to the territory covering Europe and Asia continue to be
earned by the territory partnership and are included in equity in net income of affiliates. Alliance revenues attributed to the supply of irbesartan API to Sanofi were
$80 million in 2015 and $90 million in 2014. The supply arrangement for irbesartan expired in 2015.

Ono
BMS is the principal in the end customer product sales and has the exclusive right to develop, manufacture and commercialize Opdivo, an anti-PD-1 human
monoclonal antibody being investigated as an anti-cancer treatment, in all territories worldwide except Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Ono is entitled to receive
royalties following regulatory approvals in all territories excluding the three countries listed above. Royalty rates on net sales are 4% in North America and 15% in all
other applicable territories, subject to customary adjustments.
The alliance arrangement also includes collaboration activities in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan pertaining to Opdivo, Yervoy and several BMS investigational
compounds. Both parties have the right and obligation to jointly develop and commercialize the compounds. BMS is responsible for supply of the products. Profits,
losses and development costs are shared equally for all combination therapies involving compounds of both parties. Otherwise, sharing is 80% and 20% for activities
involving only one of the party’s compounds.
BMS and Ono also have an alliance to co-develop and co-commercialize Orencia in Japan. BMS is responsible for the order fulfillment and distribution of the
intravenous formulation and Ono is responsible for the subcutaneous formulation. Both formulations are jointly promoted by both parties with assigned customer
accounts and BMS is responsible for the product supply. A co-promotion fee of 60% is paid to the other party when a sale is made to that party’s assigned customer
and is recorded in cost of products sold.

AbbVie
BMS and AbbVie have an alliance for Empliciti, a humanized monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Under the terms of the alliance, BMS was
granted exclusive global rights to co-develop and commercialize Empliciti from PDL BioPharma, Inc. (now part of AbbVie). AbbVie currently participates in joint
development and U.S. commercialization committees which BMS has final decision making authority. Both parties are co-developing the product and AbbVie funds
20% of global development costs. BMS is solely responsible for supply, distribution and sales and marketing activities within the alliance and is the principal in the
end customer product sales. AbbVie shares 30% of all profits and losses in the U.S. and is paid tiered royalties on net sales of Empliciti outside of the U.S. BMS paid
AbbVie $140 million for certain regulatory milestone events including $52 million for approval milestones through December 31, 2016. AbbVie is also entitled to
receive additional milestone payments from BMS if certain regulatory events occur ($120 million) and sales thresholds are achieved ($200 million). The agreement may
be terminated at will by BMS or by either party for material breach by the other party (subsequent to a notice period).

F-Star
In October 2014, BMS entered into an agreement with F-Star. The agreement provides BMS with an exclusive option to purchase F-Star and its Phase I ready lead
asset FS102, a targeted therapy in development for the treatment of breast and gastric cancer among a well-defined population of HER2-positive patients.
BMS paid $50 million to F-Star and its shareholders in 2014 in consideration for the option grant and certain licensing rights (included in research and development
expenses) and is responsible for conducting and funding the development of FS102. The option is exercisable at BMS's discretion and expires upon the earlier of 60
days following obtaining proof of concept or June 2018. An additional $100 million will be payable upon the exercise of the option plus an additional aggregate
consideration of up to $325 million for contingent development and regulatory approval milestone payments in the U.S. and Europe. BMS is not obligated to provide
any additional financial support to F-Star.
F-Star was determined not to be a business as defined in ASC 805 - Business Combinations. As a result, contingent consideration was not included in the purchase
price and no goodwill was recognized. However, F-Star is a variable interest entity as its equity holders lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. BMS
was determined to be the primary beneficiary because of both its power to direct the activities most significantly and directly impacting the economic performance of
the entity and its option rights described above. Upon consolidation in 2014, noncontrolling interest was credited by $59 million to reflect the fair value of the FS102
IPRD asset ($75 million) and deferred tax liabilities.
71Promedior
In September 2015, BMS purchased a warrant that gives BMS the exclusive right to acquire Promedior, a biotechnology company whose lead asset, PRM-151, is
being developed for the treatment of IPF and MF. The warrant is exercisable upon completion of either of the IPF or MF Phase II clinical studies being conducted by
Promedior, which is expected to occur no earlier than 2017. The upfront payment allocated to the warrant was $84 million and included in R&D expenses in 2015. The
remaining $66 million of the $150 million upfront payment was allocated to Promedior’s obligation to complete the Phase II studies which will be amortized over the
expected period of the Phase II studies. The allocation was determined using Level 3 inputs. Following BMS's review of the Phase II clinical study results, if BMS
elects to exercise the warrant it will be obligated to pay an additional $300 million (if based on the IPF study results) or $250 million (if based on the MF study results),
plus additional aggregate consideration of up to $800 million for contingent development and regulatory approval milestone payments in the U.S. and Europe.
Five Prime
In November 2015, BMS and Five Prime entered into an exclusive worldwide licensing and collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of Five
Prime’s CSF1R antibody program, including cabiralizumab (FPA008) currently in Phase I/II development for immunology and oncology indications. BMS will be
responsible for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of cabiralizumab, subject to Five Prime’s option to conduct certain studies at its cost to
develop cabiralizumab in PVNS and in combination with its own internal oncology pipeline assets. Five Prime also retained an option to co-promote in the U.S. The
agreement replaces a previous clinical collaboration agreement between the two parties.
In consideration for licensing rights, BMS made an upfront payment of $350 million in 2015 which was included in R&D expense. BMS will also be committed to pay
up to $1.4 billion upon the achievement of contingent development and regulatory milestones as well as future royalties if the product is approved and
commercialized.
Reckitt
In May 2013, BMS and Reckitt started a three-year alliance for several OTC products sold primarily in Mexico and Brazil. Reckitt received the right to sell, distribute
and market the products through May 2016. BMS received royalties on net sales of the products and exclusively supplied certain of the products to Reckitt pursuant
to a supply agreement at cost plus a markup. Certain limited assets, including marketing authorizations and certain employees directly attributed to the business, were
transferred to Reckitt at the start of the alliance period. BMS retained ownership of all other assets related to the business including the trademarks covering the
products.
In the framework of the alliance, BMS also granted Reckitt an option to acquire the trademarks, inventory and certain other assets exclusively related to the products
at the end of the alliance period at a price determined primarily based upon a multiple of sales from May 2014 through May 2016. In April 2014, the alliance was
modified to provide an option to Reckitt to purchase a BMS manufacturing facility located in Mexico primarily dedicated to the products included in the alliance as
well as the related employees. In July 2015, Reckitt notified BMS that it was exercising its option. In May 2016, BMS sold the business for $317 million. Refer to "—
Note 4. Acquisitions and Divestitures” for further information.
Non-refundable upfront proceeds of $485 million received by BMS in 2013 were allocated to two units of accounting, including the rights transferred to Reckitt and
the fair value of the option to purchase the remaining assets using the best estimate of the selling price for these elements after considering various market factors.
These market factors included an analysis of any estimated excess of the fair value of the business over the potential purchase price if the option is exercised. The fair
value of the option was determined using Level 3 inputs and included in other liabilities. During 2015, BMS recognized other income of $123 million to decrease the
fair value of the option to zero due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies. The amount allocated to the rights transferred to Reckitt is
amortized as alliance revenue over the contractual term.

The Medicines Company
In February 2013, BMS and The Medicines Company entered into a two-year alliance for Recothrom*, a recombinant thrombin for use as a topical hemostat to control
non-arterial bleeding during surgical procedures (previously acquired by BMS in connection with its acquisition of ZymoGenetics, Inc. in 2010). The Medicines
Company received the right to sell, distribute and market Recothrom* on a global basis for two years. BMS exclusively supplied Recothrom* to The Medicines
Company at cost plus a markup and received royalties on net sales of Recothrom*. Certain employees directly attributed to the business and certain assets were
transferred to The Medicines Company at the start of the alliance period, including the Biologics License Application and related regulatory assets. BMS retained all
other assets related to Recothrom* including the patents, trademarks and inventory.
BMS also granted The Medicines Company an option to acquire the patents, trademarks, inventory and certain other assets exclusively related to Recothrom* at a
price determined based on a multiple of sales (plus the cost of any remaining inventory held by BMS at that time). The Medicines Company exercised the option and
acquired the business for $132 million in February 2015.
Non-refundable upfront proceeds of $115 million received by BMS in 2013 were allocated to two units of accounting, including the rights transferred to The
Medicines Company and the fair value of the option to purchase the remaining assets using the best estimate of the selling price for these elements after considering
various market factors. These market factors included an analysis of any estimated excess of the fair value of the business over the potential purchase price if the
option is exercised. The fair value of the option was $35 million at December 31, 2014 and was determined using Level 3 inputs and included in accrued expenses. The
amount allocated to the rights transferred to The Medicines Company was amortized as alliance revenue over the contractual term.

markup.
BMS also granted Valeant an option to acquire the trademarks and intellectual property exclusively related to the products at a price determined based on a multiple
of sales. Valeant exercised the option and acquired the business for $61 million in January 2015.
Non-refundable upfront proceeds of $79 million received by BMS in 2012 were allocated to two units of accounting, including the rights transferred to Valeant and
the fair value of the option to purchase the remaining assets using the best estimate of the selling price for these elements after considering various market factors.
These market factors included an analysis of any estimated excess of the fair value of the business over the potential purchase price if the option is exercised. The fair
value of the option was determined using Level 3 inputs and included in accrued expenses. A $16 million charge was included in other expenses to increase the fair
value of the option to $34 million in 2014. The amount allocated to the rights transferred to Valeant was amortized as alliance revenue over the contractual term.

acquired Flexus's IDO/TDO discovery program which includes its IDO-selective, IDO/TDO dual and TDO-selective compounds. Contingent consideration includes
development and regulatory milestone payments. A $100 million milestone was achieved and paid to former shareowners of Flexus in 2016 for the commencement of a
Phase I clinical trial and included in R&D expense.
iPierian
In April 2014, BMS acquired all of the outstanding shares of iPierian, a private biotechnology company focused on new treatments for tauopathies, a class of
neurodegenerative diseases. The acquisition provided BMS with full rights to IPN007, a preclinical monoclonal antibody to treat progressive supranuclear palsy and
other tauopathies. Contingent consideration includes development and regulatory milestone payments and future royalties on net sales if any of the acquired
preclinical assets are approved and commercialized.

ViiV Healthcare
In February 2016, BMS sold its investigational HIV medicines business to ViiV Healthcare which includes a number of programs at different stages of discovery,
preclinical and clinical development. The transaction excluded BMS's HIV marketed medicines. BMS earned transitional fees of $105 million for certain R&D and other
services in 2016. In February 2016, BMS received an upfront payment of $350 million. BMS will also receive from ViiV Healthcare contingent development and
regulatory milestone payments of up to $1.1 billion, sales-based milestone payments of up to $4.3 billion and future tiered royalties if the products are approved and
commercialized.
Other Divestitures
Refer to "—Note 3. Alliances" for a discussion on the divestiture transactions with Reckitt, Lilly, The Medicines Company, Valeant and AstraZeneca. Revenues and
pretax earnings related to these businesses were not material in 2016, 2015 and 2014 (excluding the divestiture gains).
75Assets Held-For-Sale
Assets held-for-sale were $134 million at December 31, 2015 and included in prepaid expenses and other. The amount consisted primarily of goodwill related to the
investigational HIV medicines business and the business comprising an alliance with Reckitt. The allocation of goodwill was determined using the relative fair value
of the applicable business to the Company's reporting unit. Revenues and pretax earnings related to these businesses were not material in 2016, 2015 and 2014
(excluding the divestiture gains).

• A debt redemption loss of $180 million resulted from the early redemption of euro notes and a tender offer for certain other debt securities in 2015.
• Other includes an unrealized foreign exchange loss of $52 million in 2015 resulting from the remeasurement of the Bolivar-denominated cash and other
monetary balances of BMS’s wholly-owned subsidiary in Venezuela as of December 31, 2015. The exchange rate was changed to the SIMADI rate of 200 from
the official CENCOEX rate of 6.3 after considering the limited amount of foreign currency exchanged during the second half of 2015, published exchange rates
and the continuing deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela.
Note 6. RESTRUCTURING
In October 2016, the Company announced a restructuring to evolve and streamline its operating model and expects to incur charges in connection with employee
workforce reductions and early site exits. The charges are expected to be incurred through 2020, range between $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion and consist of employee
termination benefit costs, contract termination costs, accelerated depreciation on property, plant and equipment, impairments on long-lived assets and other site
shutdown costs. Cash outlays in connection with these actions are expected to be approximately 40% to 50% of the total charges. Charges of approximately $90
million were recognized for these actions during the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily resulting from certain R&D employee workforce reductions and accelerated
depreciation on expected early site exits. Restructuring charges are recognized upon meeting certain criteria, including finalization of committed plans, reliable
estimates and discussions with local works councils in certain markets.
Other restructuring charges recognized prior to the above actions were primarily related to specialty care transformation initiatives designed to create a more
simplified organization across all functions and geographic markets. In addition, accelerated depreciation and other charges were incurred in connection with early
exits of a manufacturing site in Ireland and R&D site in the U.S.
Employee termination benefit costs were incurred for manufacturing, selling, administrative, and R&D employee workforce reductions across all geographic regions
of approximately 1,100 in 2016, 1,200 in 2015 and 1,400 in 2014.

The effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily attributable to undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that have been
considered or are expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore. U.S. taxes have not been provided on approximately $25.7 billion of undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016. These undistributed earnings primarily relate to operations in Switzerland, Ireland and Puerto Rico. If these
undistributed earnings are repatriated to the U.S. in the future, or if it were determined that such earnings are to be remitted in the foreseeable future, additional tax
provisions would be required. Due to complexities in the tax laws and assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the amounts of income
taxes that will have to be provided. BMS operates under a favorable tax grant in Puerto Rico not scheduled to expire prior to 2023.
The divestiture of certain businesses resulted in capital loss tax benefits including $361 million from the sale of Amylin shares in 2014. Valuation allowances attributed
to capital loss carryforwards were released in 2015 following the divestiture of Recothrom*, Ixempra* and other mature brands. Additional reserves of $123 million
were established in 2014 for certain transfer pricing matters related to tax periods from 2008 through 2014. Orphan drug credits are included in the U.S. Federal
research based credits for all periods presented. Goodwill allocated to business divestitures (including the diabetes business in 2014) was not deductible for tax
purposes as well as the U.S. Branded Prescription Drug Fee in all periods. R&D charges resulting primarily from a milestone payment to the former shareholders of
Flexus and the acquisitions of Padlock and Cormorant in 2016, Flexus and Cardioxyl in 2015 and iPierian in 2014 were also not deductible for tax purposes. Puerto Rico
imposes an excise tax on the gross company purchase price of goods sold from our manufacturer in Puerto Rico. The excise tax is recognized in cost of products sold
when the intra-entity sale occurs. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax is not deductible but results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our
provision for income taxes when the excise tax is incurred. Increased manufacturing activities for Opdivo resulted in the higher domestic manufacturing deduction in
2016.

Accounting Policies" for information regarding the impact of amended guidance that the Company expects to adopt in 2017.
The U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforwards were $368 million at December 31, 2016. These carryforwards were acquired as a result of certain acquisitions and
are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2022. The
foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2017 (certain amounts have unlimited lives).
At December 31, 2016, a valuation allowance of $3,078 million was established for the following items: $2,894 million primarily for foreign net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards, $101 million for state deferred tax assets including net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, $11 million for U.S. Federal net operating loss
carryforwards and $72 million for other U.S. Federal deferred tax assets.

credited to capital in excess of par value of stock was $92 million in 2016, $147 million in 2015 and $131 million in 2014.
Business is conducted in various countries throughout the world and is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions. A significant number of tax returns that are filed are
subject to examination by various Federal, state and local tax authorities. Tax examinations are often complex, as tax authorities may disagree with the treatment of
items reported requiring several years to resolve. Liabilities are established for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including,
but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately
expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known. The effect of changes in estimates related to contingent tax liabilities
is included in the effective tax rate reconciliation above.

BMS is currently under examination by a number of tax authorities, including but not limited to the major tax jurisdictions listed in the table below, which have
proposed or are considering proposing material adjustments to tax for issues such as transfer pricing, certain tax credits and the deductibility of certain expenses.
BMS estimates that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 will decrease in the range of approximately $255
million to $315 million in the next twelve months as a result of the settlement of certain tax audits and other events. The expected change in unrecognized tax benefits,
primarily settlement related, will involve the payment of additional taxes, the adjustment of certain deferred taxes and/or the recognition of tax benefits. It is
reasonably possible that new issues will be raised by tax authorities that may increase unrecognized tax benefits; however, an estimate of such increases cannot
reasonably be made at this time. BMS believes that it has adequately provided for all open tax years by tax jurisdiction.
80The following is a summary of major tax jurisdictions for which tax authorities may assert additional taxes based upon tax years currently under audit and subsequent
years that will likely be audited:
U.S. 2008 to 2016

Note 9. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and payable, debt instruments and derivatives.
Changes in exchange rates and interest rates create exposure to market risk. Certain derivative financial instruments are used when available on a cost-effective basis
to hedge the underlying economic exposure. These instruments qualify as cash flow, net investment and fair value hedges upon meeting certain criteria, including
effectiveness of offsetting hedged exposures. Changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in earnings as they occur.
Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading purposes.
Financial instruments are subject to counterparty credit risk which is considered as part of the overall fair value measurement. Counterparty credit risk is monitored on
an ongoing basis and mitigated by limiting amounts outstanding with any individual counterparty, utilizing conventional derivative financial instruments and only
entering into agreements with counterparties that meet high credit quality standards. The consolidated financial statements would not be materially impacted if any
counterparty failed to perform according to the terms of its agreement. Collateral is not required by any party whether derivatives are in an asset or liability position
under the terms of the agreements.
Fair Value Measurements – The fair value of financial instruments are classified into one of the following categories:
Level 1 inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active markets accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy
provides the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.
Level 2 inputs utilize observable prices for similar instruments and quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in non-active markets. Additionally, certain
corporate debt securities utilize a third-party matrix pricing model using significant inputs corroborated by market data for substantially the full term of the
assets. Equity and fixed income funds are primarily invested in publicly traded securities valued at the respective net asset value of the underlying
investments. Level 2 derivative instruments are valued using LIBOR yield curves, less credit valuation adjustments, and observable forward foreign exchange
rates at the reporting date. Valuations of derivative contracts may fluctuate considerably from volatility in underlying foreign currencies and underlying
interest rates driven by market conditions and the duration of the contract.
Level 3 unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. There were no Level 3 financial assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and
2015.

Cash Flow Hedges — Foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge certain forecasted intercompany inventory purchase transactions and certain other
foreign currency transactions. The effective portion of changes in fair value for contracts designated as cash flow hedges are temporarily reported in accumulated
other comprehensive loss and included in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. The net gains on foreign currency forward contracts are expected to be
reclassified to net earnings (primarily included in cost of products sold) within the next two years. The notional amount of outstanding foreign currency forward
contracts was primarily attributed to the euro ($617 million) and Japanese yen ($321 million) at December 31, 2016.
In 2015, BMS entered into $750 million of forward starting interest rate swap contracts maturing in March 2017 to hedge the variability of probable forecasted interest
expense associated with potential future issuances of debt. The contracts are designated as cash flow hedges with the effective portion of fair value changes
included in other comprehensive income.
The earnings impact related to discontinued cash flow hedges and hedge ineffectiveness was not significant during all periods presented. Cash flow hedge
accounting is discontinued when the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring within 60 days after the originally forecasted date or when the hedge
is no longer effective. Assessments to determine whether derivatives designated as qualifying hedges are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of
hedged items are performed at inception and on a quarterly basis.
Net Investment Hedges — Non-U.S. dollar borrowings of €950 million ($993 million) at December 31, 2016 are designated to hedge the foreign currency exposures of
the net investment in certain foreign affiliates. These borrowings are designated as net investment hedges and recognized in long term debt. The effective portion of
foreign exchange gains on the remeasurement of euro debt was $48 million, $80 million, and $79 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and were recorded in the
foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss with the related offset in long-term debt.
Fair Value Hedges — Fixed-to-floating interest rate swap contracts are designated as fair value hedges used as an interest rate risk management strategy to create an
appropriate balance of fixed and floating rate debt. The contracts and underlying debt for the hedged benchmark risk are recorded at fair value. The effective interest
rate for the contracts is one-month LIBOR (0.70% as of December 31, 2016) plus an interest rate spread ranging from (0.1)% to 4.6%. When the underlying swap is
terminated prior to maturity, the fair value basis adjustment to the underlying debt instrument is amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of
the debt.
The notional amount of fixed-to-floating interest rate swap contracts executed was $255 million in 2016 and $200 million in 2014. The notional amount of fixed-to-

We currently have two separate $1.5 billion revolving credit facilities from a syndicate of lenders. The facilities provide for customary terms and conditions with no
financial covenants and were extended to October 2020 and July 2021. Each facility is extendable annually by one year on the anniversary date with the consent of
the lenders. No borrowings were outstanding under either revolving credit facility at December 31, 2016 or 2015.
Available financial guarantees provided in the form of stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds were $812 million at December 31, 2016. Stand-by letters of

intangible assets is expected to be approximately $220 million in 2017, $200 million in 2018, $170 million in 2019, $130 million in 2020, and $100 million in 2021. Other
intangible asset impairment charges were $33 million in 2016, $181 million in 2015 and $380 million in 2014.
A $160 million IPRD impairment charge was recognized in 2015 for BMS-986020 (LPA1 Antagonist) which was in Phase II development for treatment of IPF. The full
write-off was required after considering the occurrence of certain adverse events, voluntary suspension of the study and an internal assessment indicating a
significantly lower likelihood of regulatory and commercial success. BMS acquired BMS-986020 with its acquisition of Amira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2011. In
addition, a contingent consideration liability of $8 million related to the acquisition was also reversed because of the lower likelihood of success.
A $310 million IPRD impairment charge was recognized in 2014 for peginterferon lambda which was in Phase III development for treatment of HCV. The full write-off
was required after assessing the potential commercial viability of the asset and estimating its fair value. The assessment considered the lower likelihood of filing for
registration in certain markets after completing revised projections of revenues and expenses. A significant decline from prior projected revenues resulted from the
global introduction of oral non-interferon products being used to treat patients with HCV and no other alternative uses for the product.

Treasury stock is recognized at the cost to reacquire the shares. Shares issued from treasury are recognized utilizing the first-in first-out method.
In October 2016, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of an additional $3.0 billion of common stock.
Repurchases may be made either in the open market or through private transactions, including under repurchase plans established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.
88On February 21, 2017, BMS entered into ASR agreements with each of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC to repurchase approximately $2.0 billion
of common stock in the aggregate. The ASR will be funded through a combination of debt and cash and are part of the existing share repurchase authorization. The
total number of shares ultimately repurchased under the ASR will be determined upon final settlement and based on a discount to the volume-weighted average price
of BMS's common stock during the ASR period which is expected to be completed by June 30, 2017.

Note 16. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
BMS sponsors defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans and termination indemnity plans for regular full-time employees. The principal defined
benefit pension plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Retirement Income Plan, covering most U.S. employees and representing approximately 66% of the consolidated
pension plan assets and 61% of the obligations. Future benefits related to service for this plan were eliminated in 2009. BMS contributes at least the minimum amount
required by the ERISA. Plan benefits are based primarily on the participant’s years of credited service and final average compensation. Plan assets consist principally
of equity and fixed-income securities.

In September 2014, BMS and Fiduciary Counselors Inc., as an independent fiduciary of the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Retirement Income Plan, entered into a
definitive agreement to transfer certain U.S. pension assets to Prudential to settle approximately $1.5 billion of pension obligations. BMS purchased a group annuity
contract from Prudential in December 2014, who irrevocably assumed the obligation to make future annuity payments to certain BMS retirees. The transaction does
not change the amount of the monthly pension benefit received by affected retirees and surviving beneficiaries and resulted in a pretax settlement charge of $713
million. Pension settlement charges were also recognized after determining the annual lump sum payments will exceed the annual interest and service costs for certain
pension plans, including the primary U.S. pension plan in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Changes in defined benefit pension plan obligations, assets, funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:

Actuarial Assumptions
Weighted-average assumptions used to determine defined benefit pension plan obligations at December 31 were as follows:
2016 2015
Discount rate 3.5% 3.8%
Rate of compensation increase 0.5% 0.5%
Weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine defined benefit pension plan net periodic benefit (credit)/cost for the years ended December 31 were as
follows:
2016 2015 2014
Discount rate 3.8% 3.6% 4.2%
Expected long-term return on plan assets 7.2% 7.2% 7.6%
Rate of compensation increase 0.5% 0.8% 2.3%
The yield on high quality corporate bonds matching the duration of the benefit obligations is used in determining the discount rate. The Citi Pension Discount curve
is used in developing the discount rate for the U.S. plans.
The expected return on plan assets was determined using the expected rate of return and a calculated value of assets, referred to as the “market-related value” which
approximated the fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2016. Differences between assumed and actual returns are amortized to the market-related value on a
straight-line basis over a three-year period. Several factors are considered in developing the expected return on plan assets, including long-term historical returns and
input from external advisors. Individual asset class return forecasts were developed based upon market conditions, for example, price-earnings levels and yields and
long-term growth expectations. The expected long-term rate of return is the weighted-average of the target asset allocation of each individual asset class. Historical
long-term actual annualized returns for U.S. pension plans were as follows:
2016 2015 2014
10 years 6.1% 6.7% 7.9%
15 years 7.1% 6.0% 6.4%
20 years 7.7% 8.1% 9.3%
Actuarial gains and losses resulted from changes in actuarial assumptions (such as changes in the discount rate and revised mortality rates) and from differences
between assumed and actual experience (such as differences between actual and expected return on plan assets). Gains and losses are amortized over the life
expectancy of the plan participants for U.S. plans (34 years in 2017) and expected remaining service periods for most other plans to the extent they exceed 10% of the
higher of the market-related value or the projected benefit obligation for each respective plan. The amortization of net actuarial loss and prior service credit is
expected to be approximately $75 million in 2017. The periodic benefit cost or credit is included in cost of products sold, research and development, and marketing,
selling and administrative expenses, except for curtailments, settlements and other special termination benefits which are included in other expenses.
91Postretirement Benefit Plans
Comprehensive medical and group life benefits are provided for substantially all U.S. retirees electing to participate in comprehensive medical and group life plans
and to a lesser extent certain benefits for non-U.S. employees. The medical plan is contributory. Contributions are adjusted periodically and vary by date of
retirement. The life insurance plan is noncontributory. Plan assets consist principally of equity and fixed-income securities. Postretirement benefit plan obligations
were $308 million and $355 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and the fair value of plan assets were $331 million and $328 million at December 31,
2016 and 2015, respectively. The weighted-average discount rate used to determine benefit obligations was 3.6% at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The net periodic
benefit credits were not material.
Plan Assets

The investment valuation policies per investment class are as follows:
Level 1 inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active markets accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy
provides the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. These instruments include equity securities, equity funds and fixed income funds publicly traded on a national
securities exchange, and cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at
the time of purchase and are recognized at cost, which approximates fair value. Pending trade sales and purchases are included in cash and cash equivalents
until final settlement.
Level 2 inputs utilize observable prices for similar instruments, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in non-active markets, and other observable
inputs that can be corroborated by market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Equity funds, fixed income funds, and short-term
investment funds classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy are valued at the net asset value of their shares held at year end, which represents fair
value. Corporate debt securities and U.S. Treasury and agency securities classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy are valued utilizing observable
prices for similar instruments and quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active.
Level 3 unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. Insurance contracts are held by certain foreign pension plans and are carried at
contract value, which approximates the estimated fair value and is based on the fair value of the underlying investment of the insurance company.
In May 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance removing the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is
measured using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient. The guidance is applied retrospectively in the table above. Venture capital and limited
partnership investments are typically only redeemable through distributions upon liquidation of the underlying assets. There were no significant unfunded
commitments for these investments and essentially all liquidations are expected to occur by 2019. Most of the remaining investments using the practical expedient are
redeemable on a weekly or monthly basis.
92The following summarizes the activity for financial assets utilizing Level 3 fair value measurements:

The investment strategy is to maximize return while maintaining an appropriate level of risk to provide sufficient liquidity for benefit obligations and plan expenses. A
target asset allocation of 43% public equity (16% international, 14% global and 13% U.S.), 7% private equity and 50% long-duration fixed income is maintained for the
U.S. pension plans. Investments are diversified within each of the three major asset categories. Approximately 90% of the U.S. pension plans equity investments are
actively managed. BMS common stock represents less than 1% of the plan assets at December 31, 2016 and 2015.
Contributions and Estimated Future Benefit Payments
Contributions to pension plans were $81 million in 2016, $118 million in 2015 and $124 million in 2014 and are expected to be approximately $100 million in 2017.
Estimated annual future benefit payments (including lump sum payments) range from approximately $250 million to $400 million in each of the next five years, and
aggregate $1.4 billion in the subsequent five year period.
Savings Plans
The principal defined contribution plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Savings and Investment Program. The contribution is based on employee contributions and the
level of Company match. The expense attributed to defined contribution plans in the U.S. was approximately $190 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Note 17. EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS
On May 1, 2012, the shareholders approved the 2012 Plan, which replaced the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan. The 2012 Plan provides for 109 million shares to be
authorized for grants, plus any shares from outstanding awards under the 2007 Plan as of February 29, 2012 that expire, are forfeited, canceled, or withheld to satisfy
tax withholding obligations. As of December 31, 2016, 106 million shares were available for award. Shares are issued from treasury stock to satisfy our obligations
under this Plan.
Executive officers and key employees may be granted options to purchase common stock at no less than the market price on the date the option is granted. Options
generally become exercisable ratably over four years and have a maximum term of ten years. The plan provides for the granting of stock appreciation rights whereby
the grantee may surrender exercisable rights and receive common stock and/or cash measured by the excess of the market price of the common stock over the option
exercise price. The Company has not granted any stock options or stock appreciation rights since 2009.
Restricted stock units may be granted to key employees, subject to restrictions as to continuous employment. Generally, vesting occurs ratably over a four year
period from grant date. A stock unit is a right to receive stock at the end of the specified vesting period but has no voting rights.
Market share units are granted to executives. Vesting is conditioned upon continuous employment until the vesting date and a payout factor of at least 60% of the
share price on the award date. The payout factor is the share price on vesting date divided by share price on award date, with a maximum of 200%. The share price
used in the payout factor is calculated using an average of the closing prices on the grant or vest date, and the nine trading days immediately preceding the grant or
vest date. Vesting occurs ratably over four years.
Performance share units are granted to executives, have a three year cycle and are granted as a target number of units subject to adjustment. The number of shares
issued when performance share units vest is determined based on the achievement of performance goals and based on the Company's three-year total shareholder
return relative to a peer group of companies. Vesting is conditioned upon continuous employment and occurs on the third anniversary of the grant date.
93Stock-based compensation expense for awards ultimately expected to vest is recognized over the vesting period. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical
experience at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Other information related to stock-based
compensation benefits are as follows:

Note 18. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits, claims, government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary
course of business. These claims or proceedings can involve various types of parties, including governments, competitors, customers, suppliers, service providers,
licensees, employees, or shareholders, among others. The resolution of these matters often develops over a long period of time and expectations can change as a
result of new findings, rulings, appeals or settlement arrangements. The Company recognizes accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will
be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. These matters involve patent infringement, antitrust, securities, pricing, sales and marketing
practices, environmental, commercial, contractual rights, licensing obligations, health and safety matters, consumer fraud, employment matters, product liability and
insurance coverage. Legal proceedings that are material or that the Company believes could become material are described below.
Although the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, there can be no assurance that there will not be an increase in the scope of pending
matters or that any future lawsuits, claims, government investigations or other legal proceedings will not be material. Unless otherwise noted, the Company is unable
to assess the outcome of the respective litigation nor is it able to provide an estimated range of potential loss. Furthermore, failure to enforce our patent rights would
likely result in substantial decreases in the respective product revenues from generic competition.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Plavix* — Australia
As previously disclosed, Sanofi was notified that, in August 2007, GenRx Proprietary Limited (GenRx) obtained regulatory approval of an application for clopidogrel
bisulfate 75mg tablets in Australia. GenRx, formerly a subsidiary of Apotex Inc. (Apotex), has since changed its name to Apotex. In August 2007, Apotex filed an
application in the Federal Court of Australia (the Federal Court) seeking revocation of Sanofi’s Australian Patent No. 597784 (Case No. NSD 1639 of 2007). Sanofi filed
counterclaims of infringement and sought an injunction. On September 21, 2007, the Federal Court granted Sanofi’s injunction. A subsidiary of the Company was
subsequently added as a party to the proceedings. In February 2008, a second company, Spirit Pharmaceuticals Pty. Ltd., also filed a revocation suit against the same
patent. This case was consolidated with the Apotex case, and a trial occurred in April 2008. On August 12, 2008, the Federal Court of Australia held that claims of
Patent No. 597784 covering clopidogrel bisulfate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, and taurocholate salts were valid. The Federal Court also held that the process
claims, pharmaceutical composition claims, and claim directed to clopidogrel and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts were invalid. The Company and Sanofi filed
notices of appeal in the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia (Full Court) appealing the holding of invalidity of the claim covering clopidogrel and its
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, process claims, and pharmaceutical composition claims which have stayed the Federal Court’s ruling. Apotex filed a notice of
appeal appealing the holding of validity of the clopidogrel bisulfate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, and taurocholate claims. A hearing on the appeals occurred in
February 2009. On September 29, 2009, the Full Court held all of the claims of Patent No. 597784 invalid. In November 2009, the Company and Sanofi applied to the
High Court of Australia (High Court) for special leave to appeal the judgment of the Full Court. In March 2010, the High Court denied the Company and Sanofi’s
request to hear the appeal of the Full Court decision. The case has been remanded to the Federal Court for further proceedings related to damages sought by Apotex.
The Australian government has intervened in this matter and is also seeking damages for alleged losses experienced during the period when the injunction was in
place. The Company and Apotex have settled the Apotex case, and the case has been dismissed. The Australian government's claim is still pending and a trial has
been scheduled for August 2017. It is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of the Australian government’s claim or its impact on the Company.
95Sprycel - European Union
In May 2013, Apotex, Actavis Group PTC ehf, Generics [UK] Limited (Mylan) and an unnamed company filed oppositions in the European Patent Office (EPO)
seeking revocation of European Patent No. 1169038 (the ‘038 patent) covering dasatinib, the active ingredient in Sprycel. The ‘038 patent is scheduled to expire in
April 2020 (excluding potential term extensions). On January 20, 2016, the Opposition Division of the EPO revoked the ‘038 patent. In May 2016, the Company
appealed the EPO’s decision to the EPO Board of Appeal. On February 1, 2017, the EPO Board of Appeal upheld the Opposition Division's decision, and the ‘038
patent has been revoked. Orphan drug exclusivity and data exclusivity for Sprycel in the EU expired in November 2016. The EPO Board of Appeal's decision does not
affect the validity of our other Sprycel patents within and outside Europe, including different patents that cover the monohydrate form of dasatinib and the use of
dasatinib to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Additionally, in February 2017, the EPO Board of Appeal reversed and remanded an invalidity decision on
European Patent No. 1610780 and its claim to the use of dasatinib to treat CML, which the EPO's Opposition Division had revoked in October 2012. The Company
intends to take appropriate legal actions to protect Sprycel. We may experience a decline in European revenues in the event that generic dasatinib product enters the
market.
Anti-PD-1 Antibody Patent Oppositions and Litigation
On January 20, 2017, BMS and Ono announced the companies have signed a global patent license agreement with Merck to settle all patent-infringement litigation
related to Merck’s PD-1 antibody Keytruda* (pembrolizumab). The agreement will result in the dismissal with prejudice of all patent litigation between the companies
pertaining to Keytruda*. BMS and Ono had asserted in litigation that Merck’s sale of Keytruda* infringed the companies’ patents relating to the use of PD-1
antibodies to treat cancer in the U.S., Europe (UK, Netherlands, France, Germany, Ireland, Spain and Switzerland), Australia and Japan.
As part of the agreement, Merck will make an initial payment of $625 million to BMS and Ono. Merck is also obligated to pay ongoing royalties on global sales of
Keytruda* of 6.5% from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2023, and 2.5% from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026. Under the agreement, the companies
have also granted certain rights to each other under their respective patent portfolios pertaining to PD-1. The initial payment and royalties will be shared between
BMS and Ono on a 75/25 percent allocation, respectively after adjusting for each parties incurred legal fees.
In September 2015, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Dana-Farber) filed a complaint in Massachusetts federal court seeking to correct the inventorship of five related
U.S. patents directed to methods of treating cancer using a PD-1 antibody. Specifically, Dana-Farber is seeking to add two scientists as inventors to these patents.
PRICING, SALES AND PROMOTIONAL PRACTICES LITIGATION
Plavix* State Attorneys General Lawsuits
The Company and certain affiliates of Sanofi are defendants in consumer protection and/or false advertising actions brought by several states relating to the sales
and promotion of Plavix*. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the outcome of these lawsuits or their potential impact on the Company.
PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION
The Company is a party to various product liability lawsuits. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury
and economic loss. As previously disclosed, in addition to lawsuits, the Company also faces unfiled claims involving its products.
Plavix*
As previously disclosed, the Company and certain affiliates of Sanofi are defendants in a number of individual lawsuits in various state and federal courts claiming
personal injury damage allegedly sustained after using Plavix*. Currently, over 5,300 claims involving injury plaintiffs as well as claims by spouses and/or other
beneficiaries, are filed in state and federal courts in various states including California, New Jersey, Delaware and New York. In February 2013, the Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation granted the Company and Sanofi’s motion to establish a multi-district litigation (MDL) to coordinate Federal pretrial proceedings in Plavix*
product liability and related cases in New Jersey Federal Court. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the outcome of these lawsuits or the potential
impact on the Company.
96Byetta*
Amylin, a former subsidiary of the Company, and Lilly are co-defendants in product liability litigation related to Byetta*. To date, there are over 500 separate lawsuits
pending on behalf of approximately 2,000 active plaintiffs (including pending settlements), which include injury plaintiffs as well as claims by spouses and/or other
beneficiaries, in various courts in the U.S. The Company has agreed in principle to resolve over 30 of these claims. The majority of these cases have been brought by
individuals who allege personal injury sustained after using Byetta*, primarily pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis, and, in some cases, claiming alleged wrongful
death. The majority of cases were pending in Federal Court in San Diego in an MDL or in a coordinated proceeding in California Superior Court in Los Angeles
(JCCP). In November 2015, the defendants' motion for summary judgment based on federal preemption was granted in both the MDL and the JCCP. The plaintiffs in
the MDL have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the JCCP plaintiffs have appealed to the California Court of Appeal. Amylin has
product liability insurance covering a substantial number of claims involving Byetta* and any additional liability to Amylin with respect to Byetta* is expected to be
shared between the Company and AstraZeneca. It is not possible to reasonably predict the outcome of any lawsuit, claim or proceeding or the potential impact on the
Company.
Abilify*
The Company and Otsuka are co-defendants in product liability litigation related to Abilify. Plaintiffs allege Abilify caused them to engage in compulsive gambling
and other impulse control disorders. There have been approximately 130 cases filed in state and federal courts and several additional cases are pending in Canada.
The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has consolidated the federal court cases for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Florida.
Eliquis
The Company and Pfizer are co-defendants in product liability litigation related to Eliquis. Plaintiffs assert claims, including claims for wrongful death, as a result of
bleeding they allege was caused by their use of Eliquis. There have been over 80 cases filed in state and federal courts in the United States and two cases filed in
Canada. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has consolidated the federal court cases for pretrial purposes in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York.
SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION
Since December 2015, three shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in New York state court against certain officers and directors of the Company. The plaintiffs
allege, among other things, breaches of fiduciary duty surrounding the Company’s previously disclosed October 2015 civil settlement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission of alleged Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations in China in which the Company agreed to a payment of approximately $14.7 million in
disgorgement, penalties and interest. In May 2016, the Company filed motions to dismiss two of the shareholder derivative lawsuits.
GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS
Like other pharmaceutical companies, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies
in the U.S. and other countries in which BMS operates. As a result, the Company, from time to time, is subject to various governmental inquiries and investigations. It
is possible that criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, could result from government investigations. The most significant investigations conducted
by government agencies, of which the Company is aware, are listed below.
Abilify* State Attorneys General Investigation
In March 2009, the Company received a letter from the Delaware Attorney General’s Office advising of a multi-state coalition (Coalition) investigating whether certain
Abilify* marketing practices violated those respective states’ consumer protection statutes. The Company and the Executive Committee of the Coalition have reached
a settlement in this matter, and all but one of the states (New Mexico) that are members of the Coalition are participating in the settlement. Consent decrees were
entered into with all participating states in December 2016.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS
As previously reported, the Company is a party to several environmental proceedings and other matters, and is responsible under various state, federal and foreign
laws, including CERCLA, for certain costs of investigating and/or remediating contamination resulting from past industrial activity at the Company’s current or former
sites or at waste disposal or reprocessing facilities operated by third parties.
97CERCLA Matters
With respect to CERCLA matters for which the Company is responsible under various state, federal and foreign laws, the Company typically estimates potential costs
based on information obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or counterpart state or foreign agency and/or studies prepared by independent
consultants, including the total estimated costs for the site and the expected cost-sharing, if any, with other “potentially responsible parties,” and the Company
accrues liabilities when they are probable and reasonably estimable. The Company estimated its share of future costs for these sites to be $62 million at December 31,
2016, which represents the sum of best estimates or, where no best estimate can reasonably be made, estimates of the minimal probable amount among a range of
such costs (without taking into account any potential recoveries from other parties). The $62 million includes the estimated costs for any additional probable loss
associated with the previously disclosed North Brunswick Township High School Remediation Site.

99REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016 and
2015, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of December 31, 2016, management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based
on this evaluation, management has concluded that as of December 31, 2016, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision and with the participation of
management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2016 based on the framework in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at
December 31, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Company’s financial statements included in this report on Form 10-K and
issued its report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are
reasonable likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

101REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016, based on
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The
Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,
material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the
internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements.

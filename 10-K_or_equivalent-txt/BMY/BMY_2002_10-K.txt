PART I
Item 1. BUSINESS.
DESCRIPTION OF BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
General
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (Bristol-Myers Squibb or the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in August 1933 under the
name Bristol-Myers Company as successor to a New York business started in 1887. In 1989, the Bristol-Myers Company changed its name to Bristol-Myers Squibb
Company as a result of a merger. The Company, through its divisions and subsidiaries, is a major producer and distributor of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare
related products and has three reportable segments—Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals and Other Healthcare.
In 2000, the Company announced the planned divestiture of its Clairol and Zimmer businesses. Accordingly, the operations of these businesses have beenreflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. On November 15, 2001, the Company completed the sale of Clairol for
$4.95 billion and on August 6, 2001, the Company spun off Zimmer Holdings, Inc., in a tax-free distribution.
On October 1, 2001, the Company acquired the DuPont Pharmaceuticals business (DuPont) from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company for $7.8 billion in cash.
DuPont is primarily a domestic pharmaceutical and imaging product business focused on research and development. In addition, in November 2001, the Company
purchased 14.4 million shares of ImClone Systems Incorporated (ImClone) for $70 per share, or $1,007 million, which represented 19.9% of the shares outstanding just
prior to the Company's commencement of a public tender offer for ImClone shares. The equity investment in ImClone is part of a strategic agreement between the
Company and ImClone that also includes an arrangement to codevelop and copromote an investigational cancer drug, ERBITUX*. These transactions were financed
with proceeds from the issuance of $1.5 billion of commercial paper, the issuance of $5.0 billion of medium-term notes and internal cash flows.
The Company's Internet website address is www.bms.com. The Company makes available free of charge on its website its annual, quarterly and current reports,
including amendments to such reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

5
Medical Imaging
Medical Imaging manufactures, distributes and sells cardiovascular imaging products. Principal brands of Medical Imaging include CARDIOLITE and DEFINITY.
These products are marketed and sold worldwide, primarily to hospitals and the medical profession. The Company manufactures these products in the U.S. and
Puerto Rico.

BUFFERIN and COMTREX. These products are generally sold to retailers and promoted primarily to consumers in the U.S. and Japan through advertising. These
products are manufactured in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Japan.
Consumer Medicines sales accounted for 2% of the Company's sales in each of 2002 and 2001, and 3% of the Company's sales in 2000.
SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS
In general, Bristol-Myers Squibb purchases its principal raw materials and supplies in the open market. Substantially all such materials are obtainable from a
number of sources, and the loss of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES
The Company owns or is licensed under a number of patents in the U.S. and foreign countries covering products and has also developed many brand names and
trademarks for products. The Company considers the overall protection of its patent, trademark and license rights to be of material value and acts to protect these
rights from infringement. U.S. patents that are expected to expire in the next three years include the patent for CEFZIL (December 2005) and one of several patents
relating to PLAVIX* (July 2003). In addition, a use patent for PARAPLATIN will expire in April 2004. Hatch-Waxman data protection will expire for GLUCOPHAGE*
XR in October 2003 and for GLUCOVANCE* in July 2003. All of these expiry dates could be extended by six months under the pediatric extension upon the
completion and acceptance of pediatric studies by the FDA in advance of the expiration. The Company received the six month pediatric extension for the composition
of matter patent for MONOPRIL, which is now expected to expire in June 2003, the composition of matter patent for SERZONE, which is now expected to expire in
September 2003, and a patent covering the formulation of VIDEX EC, which is now expected to expire in May 2004. Except with respect to PLAVIX*, as discussed in
Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in Part I of this Form 10-K and Note 22, Litigation Matters, to the consolidated financial statements, the Company believes that no single
patent or license is of material importance in relation to the business as a whole.
COMPETITION, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMERS
The markets in which Bristol-Myers Squibb competes are generally broad-based and highly competitive. The principal means of competition used to market the
products of Bristol-Myers Squibb include quality, service, price, and product performance. Pharmaceutical products and the products of ConvaTec are promoted on a
national and international basis in medical journals and directly to the medical profession. The Company is also using direct-to-consumer advertising for a number of
its pharmaceutical products. Most of the other products of Bristol-Myers Squibb are generally advertised
6
and promoted on a national and international basis through the use of television, radio, print media, consumer offers, and window and in-store displays. Bristol-
Myers Squibb's products are principally sold to the wholesale and retail trade both nationally and internationally. Certain products are also sold to other drug
manufacturers, hospitals and the medical profession. In 2002 and 2001, sales to AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. (Cardinal) and McKesson
Corporation (McKesson) each accounted for approximately 14% of the Company's net sales. In 2000, sales to Cardinal and McKesson accounted for approximately
12% and 10%, respectively, of the Company's net sales.
The Company accounts for certain sales of pharmaceutical products to Cardinal and McKesson using the consignment model. For a discussion of the
Company's accounting using the consignment model and its relationship with wholesalers, see Note 1, Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements
and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in Part II of this Form 10-K.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and development is essential to Bristol-Myers Squibb's business. Pharmaceutical research and development is carried out by the Bristol-Myers Squibb
Pharmaceutical Research Institute, which has major facilities in Princeton, Hopewell and New Brunswick, New Jersey and Wallingford, Connecticut. Pharmaceutical
research and development is also carried out at various other facilities in the U.S. and in Belgium, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. Management continues
to emphasize leadership, innovation and productivity as strategies for success in the Pharmaceutical Research Institute.
Bristol-Myers Squibb spent $2,218 million in 2002, $2,183 million in 2001, and $1,878 million in 2000 on Company sponsored research and development activities.
Pharmaceutical research and development spending, as a percentage of pharmaceutical sales, was 14.4% in 2002 compared with 14.2% in 2001 and 12.4% in 2000.
REGULATION
Most aspects of the Company's business are subject to some degree of government regulation in the countries in which its operations are conducted. The
Company's policy is to comply fully with all regulatory requirements applying to its products and operations. For some products, and in some countries, governmentregulation is significant and, in general, there is a trend towards more stringent regulation. The Company devotes significant time, effort and expense addressing the
extensive governmental regulatory requirements applicable to its business. Governmental regulatory actions can result in the recall or seizure of products, suspension
or revocation of the authority necessary for the production or sale of a product, and other civil and criminal sanctions.
In the U.S., the drug, medical device, diagnostic and food industries in which the Company operates have long been subject to regulation by various federal,
state and local agencies, primarily as to product manufacture, safety, efficacy, advertising and labeling.
In addition, governmental bodies in the U.S. as well as other countries have expressed concern about costs relating to health care and, in some cases, have
focused attention on the pricing of drugs and on appropriate drug utilization. Government regulation in these areas already exists in some countries and may be
expanded significantly in the U.S. and other countries in the future.
While the Company is unable to predict the extent to which its business may be affected by future regulatory developments, it believes that its substantial
experience in dealing with governmental regulatory requirements and restrictions on its operations throughout the world and its development of new and improved
products should enable it to compete effectively within this environment.

Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings are pending against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The most significant of these are described below.
TAXOL® LITIGATION
In 1997 and 1998, the Company filed several lawsuits asserting that a number of generic drug companies infringed its patents covering methods of administering
paclitaxel when they filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking regulatory approval to sell paclitaxel. These actions were consolidated for discovery in the
U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (District Court). The Company did not assert a monetary claim against any of the defendants, but sought to prevent
the defendants from marketing paclitaxel in a manner that violates its patents. The defendants asserted that they did not infringe the Company's patents and that
these patents are invalid and unenforceable.
In early 2000, the District Court invalidated most claims of the Company's patents at issue. On April 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
affirmed the District Court's summary judgment of the invalidity of all but two claims of the patents at issue. Those two claims relate to the low-dose, three-hour
administration of paclitaxel in which the patient is given a specified regimen of premedicants before the administration of paclitaxel. The appellate court remanded
those two claims to the District Court for further proceedings. In 2001, the Company filed an additional patent infringement suit against another company seeking to
market generic paclitaxel.
In September 2000, one of the defendants received final approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its Abbreviated New Drug Application
for paclitaxel and is marketing the product. The FDA has since announced additional final approvals and sales of additional generic products have begun.
Some of the defendants asserted counterclaims seeking damages for alleged antitrust and unfair competition violations. The Company believed its patents were
valid when it filed the suits, and the counterclaims asserted are believed to be without merit. The lawsuits with all defendants who asserted counterclaims have been
settled, with the defendants agreeing to drop all claims relating to paclitaxel and the Company granting licenses to them under certain paclitaxel patent rights.9
Since the filing of the initial patent infringement suits, six private actions have been filed by parties alleging antitrust, consumer protection and similar claims
relating to the Company's actions to obtain and enforce patent rights. The plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment, damages (including treble and/or punitive damages
where allowed), disgorgement and injunctive relief. In June 2002, a group of 32 state attorneys general, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands
brought similar claims. In September 2000, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) initiated an investigation relating to paclitaxel.
On January 7, 2003, the Company announced that it reached agreements in principle that would settle substantially all antitrust litigation surrounding TAXOL®.
The amount of the TAXOL® antitrust settlements is expected to be $135 million, the full amount of which was accrued in the third quarter of 2002. Certain important
terms and conditions of the settlements remain to be finalized, and certain settlements require court approval. Final approval by the state attorneys general in the
TAXOL® litigation is contingent upon further agreements relating to the terms of injunctive relief. Among the provisions remaining to be negotiated are the terms for
incorporating certain claimants, including a number of health insurers, into the existing settlement framework. The Company is in discussions with a number of
insurers. Whether they will ultimately join the proposed settlement cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.
The Company has also reached agreement with the FTC staff on the terms of a consent order that would resolve the FTC's investigation. The proposed consent
order is subject to review and approval by the FTC commissioners.
Other than with respect to the abovementioned proposed settlements, it is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these lawsuits or
reasonably to estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to these lawsuits. If the proposed settlements do not become final or do not resolve all
TAXOL®-related antitrust, consumer protection and similar claims, and if the Company were not to prevail in final, non-appealable determinations of ensuing
litigation, the impact could be material.
BUSPAR LITIGATION
On November 21, 2000, the Company obtained a patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,150,365 ('365 patent), relating to a method of using BUSPAR or buspirone. The
Company timely submitted information relating to the '365 patent to the FDA for listing in an FDA publication commonly known as the "Orange Book", and the FDA
thereafter listed the patent in the Orange Book.
Delisting and Patent Suits. Generic-drug manufacturers sued the FDA and the Company to compel the delisting of the '365 patent from the Orange Book.
Although one district court declined to order the delisting of the '365 patent, another ordered the Company to cause the delisting of the patent from the Orange Book.
The Company complied with the court's order but appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appellate court reversed
the district court that ordered the delisting. Concurrently, the Company sought to enforce the '365 patent in actions against two generic drug manufacturers.
Antitrust Suits. Following the delisting of the '365 patent from the Orange Book, a number of purchasers of buspirone and several generic drug makers filed
lawsuits against the Company alleging that it improperly triggered statutory marketing exclusivity. The plaintiffs claimed that this was a violation of antitrust,
consumer protection and other similar laws. The attorneys general of 36 states and Puerto Rico also filed suit against the Company with parallel allegations. The
plaintiffs have amended their allegations to include charges that a 1994 agreement between the Company and a generic company improperly blocked the entry of
generic buspirone into the market. Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment, damages (including treble and/or punitive damages where allowed), disgorgement and
injunctive relief.
10
Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) Proceedings. The Judicial Panel on MDL granted the Company's motions to have all of the patent and antitrust cases consolidated
in a single forum. The court before which the buspirone litigations are now pending issued two opinions dated February 14, 2002. In the first opinion, the court found
that the '365 patent does not cover uses of buspirone and therefore is not infringed. In the second opinion, the court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the
federal antitrust and various state law claims. The second opinion allows the claims against the Company to proceed, except as to federal antitrust claims for damages
accrued more than four years before the filing of the complaints.
Government Investigations. The FTC and a number of state attorneys general initiated investigations concerning the matters alleged in the antitrust suits and
discussed above. The Company cooperated in these investigations. A number of attorneys general, but not all of them, filed an action against the Company, as noted
above.
Proposed Settlements. On January 7, 2003, the Company announced that it reached agreements in principle that would settle substantially all antitrust litigation
surrounding BUSPAR. The amount of the BUSPAR settlements is expected to be $535 million, of which $35 million was accrued in the fourth quarter of 2001,
$90 million was accrued in the first quarter of 2002, and $410 million was accrued in the third quarter of 2002. Written settlement agreements with a number of parties
have now been signed. Certain of these settlements require court approval. A number of health insurers have not agreed to the proposed settlement framework.
Whether these cases will ultimately be settled cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.
The Company has also reached agreement with the FTC staff on the terms of a consent order that would resolve the FTC's investigation. The proposed consent
order is subject to review and approval by the FTC commissioners.
Other than with respect to the abovementioned proposed settlements of BUSPAR antitrust litigation, it is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final
outcome of these lawsuits or reasonably to estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to these lawsuits. If the proposed settlements do not become final
or do not resolve all BUSPAR-related antitrust, consumer protection and similar claims, and if the Company were not to prevail in final, non-appealable determinations
of ensuing litigation, the impact could be material.
VANLEV LITIGATION
In April, May and June 2000, the Company, its former chairman of the board and chief executive officer, Charles A. Heimbold, Jr., and its former chief scientific
officer, Peter S. Ringrose, Ph.D., were named as defendants in a number of class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal securities laws and regulations. These
actions have been consolidated into one action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The plaintiff claims that the defendants disseminated
materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material information concerning the safety, efficacy and commercial viability of its product
VANLEV during the period November 8, 1999 through April 19, 2000.
In May 2002, the plaintiff submitted an amended complaint adding allegations that the Company, its present chairman of the board and chief executive officer,
Peter R. Dolan, its former chairman of the board and chief executive officer, Charles A. Heimbold, Jr., and its former chief scientific officer, Peter S. Ringrose, Ph.D.,disseminated materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material information concerning the safety, efficacy, and commercial viability of
VANLEV during the period April 19, 2000 through March 20, 2002. A number of related class actions, making essentially the same allegations, were also filed in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. These actions have been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of New
11
Jersey. The plaintiff purports to seek compensatory damages, costs and expenses on behalf of shareholders.
It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of this litigation or reasonably to estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to
this litigation. If the Company were not to prevail in final, non-appealable determinations of this litigation, the impact could be material.
PLAVIX* LITIGATION
The Company is part owner of an entity that is a plaintiff in two pending patent infringement lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York, entitled Sanofi-Synthelabo, Sanofi-Synthelabo Inc., and Bristol-Myers Squibb Sanofi Pharmaceuticals Holding Partnership v. Apotex Inc. and Apotex
Corp., 02-CV-2255 (RWS) and Sanofi-Synthelabo, Sanofi-Synthelabo Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Sanofi Pharmaceuticals Holding Partnership v. Dr. Reddy's
Laboratories, LTD, and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., 02-CV-3672 (RWS). The suits are based on U.S. Patent No. 4,847,265, which discloses and claims, among other
things, the hydrogen sulfate salt of clopidogrel, which is marketed as PLAVIX*, and on U.S. Patent No. 5,576,328, which discloses and claims, among other things,
the use of clopidogrel to prevent a secondary ischemic event. Plaintiffs' infringement position is based on defendants' filing of their Abbreviated New Drug
Applications with the FDA, seeking approval to sell generic clopidogrel prior to the expiration of the patents in suit.
It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these lawsuits or reasonably to estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to
these lawsuits. If patent protection for PLAVIX* were lost, the impact on the Company's operations could be material.
OTHER SECURITIES MATTERS
During the period March through May 2002, the Company and a number of its current and former officers were named as defendants in a number of securities
class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal securities laws and regulations. The plaintiffs variously alleged that the defendants disseminated materially false
and misleading statements and failed to disclose material information concerning three different matters: (1) safety, efficacy and commercial viability of VANLEV (as
discussed above), (2) the Company's sales incentives to certain wholesalers and the inventory levels of those wholesalers, and (3) the Company's investment in and
relations with ImClone Systems Incorporated (ImClone), and ImClone's product, ERBITUX*. As discussed above, the allegations concerning VANLEV have been
transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and consolidated with the action pending there. The remaining actions have been consolidated
and are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The allegations of these remaining actions cover the period January 2001 through
April 2002. The plaintiffs seek compensatory damages, costs and expenses.
In October 2002, a number of the Company's officers, directors and former directors were named as defendants in a shareholder derivative suit pending in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Company is a nominal defendant. The suit alleges, among other things, violations of the federal
securities laws and breaches of contract and fiduciary duty in connection with the Company's sales incentives to certain wholesalers, the inventory levels of those
wholesalers and its investment in ImClone and ImClone's product, ERBITUX*. Two similar actions are pending in New York State court. Plaintiffs seek damages,
costs and attorneys' fees.
In April 2002, the SEC initiated an inquiry into the wholesaler inventory issues referenced above, which became a formal investigation in August 2002. In
December 2002, that investigation was expanded to include certain accounting issues, including issues related to the establishment of reserves, and accounting for
certain asset and other sales. In October 2002, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey announced an investigation into the wholesaler
inventory issues referenced above, which has since expanded to cover the same subject matter as the SEC investigation. In the opinion of management, all material
adjustments necessary to correct the previously issued financial statements have been recorded as part of the restatement, and the Company does not expect any
further restatement. As described below, however, the Company cannot reasonably assess the final outcome of these investigations at this time. The Company is
cooperating with both of these investigations. The Company's own investigation is also continuing.
12
It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these litigations and investigations or reasonably to estimate the possible loss or range of
loss with respect to these litigations and investigations. The Company is producing documents and actively cooperating with these investigations, which
investigations could result in the assertion of criminal and/or civil claims. If the Company were not to prevail in final, non-appealable determinations of these
litigations and investigations, the impact could be material.
ERISA LITIGATION
In December 2002 and in the first quarter of 2003, the Company and others were named as defendants in a number of class actions brought under the federal
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The cases are pending in the U.S. District Courts for the Southern District of New York and the District of New
Jersey. Plaintiffs allege that defendants breached various fiduciary duties imposed by ERISA and owed to participants in the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Savings
and Investment Program (Program), including a duty to disseminate material information concerning: (1) safety data of the Company's product VANLEV, (2) the
Company's sales incentives to certain wholesalers and the inventory levels of those wholesalers, and (3) the Company's investment in and relations with ImClone,
and ImClone's product, ERBITUX*. In connection with the above allegations, plaintiffs further assert that defendants breached fiduciary duties to diversify Program
assets, to monitor investment alternatives, to avoid conflicts of interest, and to remedy alleged fiduciary breaches by co-fiduciaries. In the case pending in the District
of New Jersey, plaintiffs additionally allege violation by defendants of a duty to disseminate material information concerning alleged anti-competitive activities related
to the Company's products BUSPAR, TAXOL®, and PRAVACHOL. Plaintiffs seek to recover losses caused by defendants' alleged violations of ERISA and
attorneys' fees.
It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these matters or reasonably to estimate possible loss or range of loss with respect to
these lawsuits. If the Company were not to prevail in final, non-appealable determinations of these matters, the impact could be material.
AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICING LITIGATION
The Company, together with a number of other pharmaceutical manufacturers, is a defendant in a series of state and federal actions by private plaintiffs, brought
as purported class actions, and complaints filed by the attorneys general of two states and one county, alleging that the manufacturers' reporting of prices for certain
products has resulted in a false and overstated Average Wholesale Price (AWP), which in turn improperly inflated the reimbursement paid by Medicare beneficiaries,insurers, state Medicaid programs, medical plans, and others to health care providers who prescribed and administered those products. The federal cases (and many
of the state cases, including the attorney general cases, which have been removed to federal courts) have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes and transferred to
the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, In re Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price Litigation (AWP MultiDistrict Litigation).
On September 6, 2002, several of the private plaintiffs in the AWP MultiDistrict Litigation filed a Master Consolidated Complaint (Master Complaint), which
superseded the complaints in their pre-consolidated constituent cases. The Master Complaint asserts claims under the federal RICO statute and state consumer
protection and fair trade statutes. The Company and the other defendants moved to dismiss the Master Complaint, and motions were heard on January 13, 2003. The
Nevada and Montana Attorneys General have moved to have their respective cases remanded to state court and argument on the motion was held on March 7, 2003.
The Company is also a defendant in related state court proceedings in New York, New Jersey, California, Arizona and Tennessee, and in one federal court proceeding
in New York commenced by the County of Suffolk. The New York and New Jersey state court proceedings are currently stayed. The Company, and the other
defendants, have removed, or intend to remove, the other state court cases to federal court and will seek to have them transferred
13
to the AWP MultiDistrict Litigation. The Company anticipates that the County of Suffolk case will also be transferred there. Plaintiffs seek damages as well as
injunctive relief aimed at manufacturer price reporting practices. These cases are at a very preliminary stage, and the Company is unable to assess the outcome and
any possible effect on its business and profitability, or reasonably to estimate possible loss or range of loss with respect to these cases.
The Company, together with a number of other pharmaceutical manufacturers, also has received subpoenas and other document requests from various
government agencies seeking records relating to its pricing and marketing practices for drugs covered by Medicare and/or Medicaid. The requests for records have
come from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services
in conjunction with the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, and several states.
The Company is producing documents and actively cooperating with these investigations, which could result in the assertion of criminal and/or civil claims. The
Company is unable to assess the outcome of, or to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to, these investigations, which could include
the imposition of fines, penalties and administrative remedies.
BREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION
The Company, together with its subsidiary Medical Engineering Corporation (MEC) and certain other companies, remains a defendant in a number of claims and
lawsuits alleging damages for personal injuries of various types resulting from polyurethane-covered breast implants and smooth-walled breast implants formerly
manufactured by MEC or a related company. The vast majority of claims against the Company in direct lawsuits have been resolved through settlements or trial.
Likewise, claims or potential claims against the Company registered in the nationwide class action settlement approved by the Federal District Court in Birmingham,
Alabama (Revised Settlement), have been or will be resolved through the Revised Settlement. The Company has established accruals in respect of breast implant
product liability litigation. The Company believes that any possible loss in addition to the amounts accrued will not be material.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
Recent Developments
The Company restated its previously issued financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2001, including the corresponding 2001 and 2000 interim
periods, and the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2002 and June 30, 2002. The restatement affected periods prior to 1999. The impact of the restatement on such
prior periods was reflected as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 1999. The restatement was reported in Amendment No. 1 to the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2001, and Amendments No. 1 to the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A for the quarterly
periods ended March 31, 2002 and June 30, 2002.
The Company experienced a substantial buildup of wholesaler inventories in its U.S. pharmaceuticals business over several years, primarily in 2000 and 2001.
This buildup was primarily due to sales incentives offered by the Company to its wholesalers. These incentives were generally offered towards the end of a quarter in
order to incentivize wholesalers to purchase products in an amount sufficient to meet the Company's quarterly sales projections established by the Company's senior
management. In April 2002, the Company disclosed this substantial buildup, and developed and subsequently undertook a plan to work down in an orderly fashion
these wholesaler inventory levels.
In late October 2002, based on further review and consideration of the previously disclosed buildup of wholesaler inventories in the Company's U.S.
pharmaceuticals business and the incentives offered to certain wholesalers, and on advice from the Company's independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
the Company determined that it was required to restate its sales and earnings to correct errors in timing of revenue recognition for certain sales to certain U.S.
pharmaceuticals wholesalers. Since that time, the Company undertook an analysis of its transactions and incentive practices with U.S. pharmaceuticals wholesalers.
As a result of its analysis, the Company determined that certain of its sales to two of the largest wholesalers for the U.S. pharmaceuticals business should be
accounted for under the consignment model rather than recognizing revenue for such transactions upon shipment, based in part on the relationship between the
amount of incentives offered to these wholesalers and the amount of inventory held by these wholesalers. This determination involved evaluation of a variety ofcriteria and a number of complex accounting judgments.
Following its determination to restate its sales and earnings for the matters described above, the Company also determined that it would correct certain of its
historical accounting policies to conform the accounting to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and certain known errors made in the application
of GAAP that were previously not recorded because in each such case the Company believed the amount of any such error was not material to the Company's
consolidated financial statements. In addition, as part of the restatement process, the Company investigated its accounting practices in certain areas that involve
significant judgments and determined to restate additional items with respect to which the Company concluded errors were made in the application of GAAP,
including certain revisions of inappropriate accounting.
Senior management set aggressive targets for each of the Company's businesses. The errors and inappropriate accounting, which were corrected by the
restatement, arose, at least in part, from a period of unrealistic expectations for, and consequent over-estimation of the anticipated performance of, certain of the
Company's products and programs.
In connection with their audits of the restatement of previously issued annual financial statements and the Company's consolidated financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2002, the Company's independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, identified and communicated to the
20
Company and the Audit Committee two "material weaknesses" (as defined under standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants)
relating to the Company's accounting and public financial reporting of significant matters and to its initial recording and management review and oversight of certain
accounting matters.
In the last year, the Company searched for and hired a new chief financial officer from outside the Company, restaffed the controller position, created a position
of chief compliance officer and changed leadership at the Pharmaceuticals group.
In response to the wholesaler inventory buildup and the other matters identified as restatement adjustments, under the direction of the Audit Committee, in the
last year, senior management has directed that the Company dedicate resources and take steps to strengthen control processes and procedures in order to identify
and rectify past accounting errors and prevent a recurrence of the circumstances that resulted in the need to restate prior period financial statements. The Company
also revised its budgeting process to emphasize a bottom-up approach in contrast to a top-down approach. The Company has implemented a review and certification
process of its annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as well as processes designed to enhance the monitoring of
wholesaler inventories. In addition, the Company is in the process of expanding its business risks and disclosure group, which includes senior management,
including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, and is taking a number of additional steps designed to create a more open environment for
communications and flow of information throughout the Company. The Company continues to identify and implement actions to improve the effectiveness of its
disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls, including plans to enhance its resources and training with respect to financial reporting and disclosure
responsibilities, and to review such actions with its Audit Committee and independent auditors.
The Company's accounting for certain of its sales to two of the largest wholesalers for the U.S. pharmaceuticals business under the consignment model is
discussed below under —Net Sales.
Throughout the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, all referenced amounts for prior periods
and prior period comparisons reflect the balances and amounts on a restated basis.
Summary
In 2002, the Company reported annual global sales of $18.1 billion. Sales increased 1% from the prior year level, reflecting volume increases of 4%, offset by net
price declines of 3%, and no net impact from foreign exchange fluctuations. Earnings from continuing operations in 2002 were $2,034 million, or $1.05 per share on a
basic and diluted basis, compared to $2,043 million, or $1.05 basic earnings per share and $1.04 diluted earnings per share, in 2001. Several items affected the
comparability of the results between 2002 and 2001, as discussed below under —Earnings.
In addition to these items, earnings in 2002 were adversely affected by generic competition in the U.S. on several key pharmaceutical products and an increase in
interest expense due to the $5.0 billion of debt issued in the third quarter of 2001 to finance the DuPont and ImClone transactions. Partially offsetting this decline in
2002 was the favorable impact of DuPont operations.
In 2002, the Company had two blockbuster products, each with sales of over $1.5 billion—PRAVACHOL and PLAVIX*. PRAVACHOL sales grew 8% to
$2.3 billion, and PLAVIX* sales grew 61% to $1.9 billion. In addition to these two products, the Company had 42 product lines with more than $50 million in annual
sales, including 27 products with more than $100 million in annual sales, of which four had annual sales in excess of $500 million.
The Company's financial position remains strong. At December 31, 2002, the Company held almost $4.0 billion in cash, time deposits and marketable securities.
Approximately $3.7 billion of such
21
cash, time deposits and marketable securities is held by the Company's foreign subsidiaries. Repatriation of this cash to the U.S. would require additional tax
provisions, which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. For a further discussion of this matter, see Critical Accounting Policies—Income Taxes
below. Cash provided from operating activities was $1.0 billion, and working capital was a healthy $1.8 billion. The Company paid dividends of approximately
$2.2 billion, which provided a dividend yield of 4.8% in 2002.
In 2002, consistent with the Company's mission to extend and enhance human life by developing the highest-quality products, the Company invested $2.2 billion
in research and development, a 2% growth over 2001. Research and development dedicated to pharmaceutical products was $2.1 billion and increased to 14.4% of
pharmaceutical sales compared to 14.2% in 2001. The compound annualized growth in pharmaceutical research and development spending was 12% over the past five
years.
Research and development highlights included:
• U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory approval for the new chemical entity (NCE) ABILIFY*, a new anti-psychotic medicationindicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. In the U.S., the Company markets ABILIFY* jointly with Otsuka America Pharmaceutical.
• Eight FDA regulatory approvals for the following life cycle management (LCM) indications: VIDEX EC once daily tablet, SUSTIVA once daily tablet,
PLAVIX* acute coronary syndrome, AVAPRO*/APROVEL* diabetic nephropathy, GLUCOVANCE* in combination with thiazolidinediones,
PRAVACHOL pediatrics, ZERIT XR and Prolonged Release Capsule, and TEQUIN for the uncomplicated skin and skin structure indication.
• Seven regulatory filings were achieved in 2002, including U.S. and European submissions for the NCE atazanavir and six LCM supplemental filings
(SERZONE pediatrics, TAXOL® first-line metastatic breast cancer, PRAVACHOL pediatrics, MONOPRIL pediatrics, PLATINOL hepatocellular
carcinoma and GLUCOPHAGE* XR 750 mg Reduced Mass Tablet).
Patent expirations in the U.S. on several key products, including GLUCOPHAGE* IR, TAXOL® and BUSPAR, had a significant impact on the Company's
financial performance during 2002. U.S. patents that are expected to expire in the next three years include the patent for CEFZIL (December 2005) and one of several
patents relating to PLAVIX* (July 2003). In addition, a use patent for PARAPLATIN will expire in April 2004. Hatch-Waxman data protection will expire for
GLUCOPHAGE* XR in October 2003, and for GLUCOVANCE* in July 2003. All of these expiry dates could be extended by six-months under the pediatric extension
upon the completion and acceptance of pediatric studies by the FDA in advance of the expiration. The Company received the six-month pediatric extension for the
composition of matter patent for MONOPRIL, which is now expected to expire in June 2003, and the composition of matter patent for SERZONE, which is now
expected to expire in September 2003, and a patent covering the formulation of VIDEX EC, which is now expected to expire in May 2004. Except with respect to
PLAVIX*, as discussed in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in Part I of this Form 10-K and Note 22, Litigation Matters, to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company believes that no single patent or license is of material importance in relation to the business as a whole.
Net Sales
Sales in 2002 were $18.1 billion, an increase of 1% from the prior year, compared to sales increases of 3% and 6% in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Sales in 2002 and
2001 include approximately $1,540 million and $331 million, respectively, of sales related to products acquired as part of the DuPont acquisition, which was completed
on October 1, 2001. Domestic sales decreased 3% to $11,361 million in 2002, compared to an increase of 2% to $11,744 million in 2001, while international sales
increased 8% to $6,758 million in 2002 (foreign exchange had no significant impact), compared to
22
an increase of 3% to $6,243 million in 2001 (foreign exchange unfavorably impacted sales by 6%). In general, the Company's business is not seasonal. For information
on U.S. pharmaceuticals prescriber demand, reference is made to the table on page 31, which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total
(both retail and mail order customers) prescription growth for certain of the Company's primary care pharmaceutical products.
The composition of the net increase in sales is as follows:
2002 2001 2000
Foreign Exchange — (2%) (3%)
Volume 4% 2% 7%
Selling prices, net (3%) 3% 2%
Increase in sales 1% 3% 6%
A significant portion of the Company's U.S. pharmaceuticals sales is made to wholesalers. The Company experienced a substantial buildup of wholesaler
inventories in its U.S. pharmaceuticals business over several years, primarily in 2000 and 2001. This buildup was primarily due to sales incentives offered by the
Company to its wholesalers, including discounts, buy-ins in anticipation of price increases, and extended payment terms to certain U.S. pharmaceuticals wholesalers.
These incentives were generally offered towards the end of a quarter in order to incentivize wholesalers to purchase products in an amount sufficient to meet the
Company's quarterly sales projections established by the Company's senior management. The timing of the Company's recognition of revenue from its sales to
wholesalers differs by wholesaler and by period.
Historically, the Company recognized revenue for sales upon shipment of product to its customers. Under GAAP, revenue is recognized when substantially all
the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred. In the case of sales made to wholesalers (1) as a result of incentives, (2) in excess of the wholesaler's ordinary
course of business inventory level, (3) at a time when there was an understanding, agreement, course of dealing or consistent business practice that the Company
would extend incentives based on levels of excess inventory in connection with future purchases and (4) at a time when such incentives would cover substantially
all, and vary directly with, the wholesaler's cost of carrying inventory in excess of the wholesaler's ordinary course of business inventory level, substantially all the
risks and rewards of ownership do not transfer upon shipment and, accordingly, such sales should be accounted for using the consignment model. The
determination of when, if at all, sales to a wholesaler meet the foregoing criteria involves evaluation of a variety of factors and a number of complex judgments.
Under the consignment model, the Company does not recognize revenue upon shipment of product. Rather, upon shipment of product the Company invoices
the wholesaler, records deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price and classifies the inventory held by the wholesalers as consignment inventory at the Company's
cost of such inventory. The Company recognizes revenue (net of discounts, rebates, estimated sales allowances and accruals for returns) when the consignment
inventory is no longer subject to incentive arrangements but not later than when such inventory is sold through to the wholesalers' customers, on a first-in first-out
(FIFO) basis. For additional discussion of the Company's revenue recognition policy, see Note 1, Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.
The Company restated its previously issued financial statements for the period 1999 through the second quarter of 2002 to correct the timing of revenue
recognition for certain previously recognized U.S. pharmaceuticals sales to Cardinal Health, Inc. (Cardinal) and McKesson Corporation (McKesson), two of the
largest wholesalers for the Company's U.S. pharmaceuticals business, that, based on the application of the criteria described above, were recorded in error at the time
of shipment and should have been accounted for using the consignment model. The Company determined that shipments of
23
product to Cardinal and shipments of product to McKesson met the consignment model criteria set forth above as of July 1, 1999 and July 1, 2000, respectively, and,
in each case, continuing through the end of 2002 and for some period thereafter. Accordingly, the consignment model was required to be applied to such shipments.
Prior to those respective periods, the Company recognized revenue with respect to sales to Cardinal and McKesson upon shipment of product. Although theCompany generally views approximately one month of supply as a desirable level of wholesaler inventory on a going-forward basis and as a level of wholesaler
inventory representative of an industry average, in applying the consignment model to sales to Cardinal and McKesson, the Company defined inventory in excess of
the wholesaler's ordinary course of business inventory level as inventory above two weeks and three weeks of supply, respectively, based on the levels of inventory
that Cardinal and McKesson required to be used as the basis for negotiation of incentives granted.
As a result of this restatement adjustment, net sales were reduced by $1,015 million, $475 million and $409 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and
increased by $508 million in the six months ended June 30, 2002. The corresponding effect on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and
income taxes was a reduction of $789 million, $399 million and $322 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and an increase of $412 million in the six months ended
June 30, 2002.
Separately from the above discussion, in March 2001, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with McKesson for provision of warehousing and
order fulfillment services for the Company's Oncology Therapeutics Network (OTN), a specialty distributor of anti-cancer medicines and related products. Prior to the
restatement, the Company recorded in error sales of the Company's products under this agreement upon shipment of product to McKesson. The Company restated
its previously issued financial statements to account for these sales under the consignment model. The resulting effect on net sales and earnings from continuing
operations before minority interest and income taxes was a reduction of $81 million and $77 million, respectively, in 2001, and an increase of $25 million and
$24 million, respectively, in the six months ended June 30, 2002.
At December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company's aggregate cost of the pharmaceutical products held by Cardinal and McKesson that were accounted for
using the consignment model (and, accordingly, were reflected as consignment inventory on the Company's consolidated balance sheet) was approximately
$58 million, $208 million and $99 million, respectively, of which approximately $1 million and $4 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to OTN.
The deferred revenue, recorded at gross invoice sales price, related to the inventory of pharmaceutical products accounted for using the consignment model was
approximately $470 million, $2,026 million and $908 million at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of which approximately $39 million and $81 million at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to OTN. As a result of the restatement for the application of the consignment model, approximately $1,980 million of
sales (calculated net of customary 2% early pay cash discounts) had been reversed from the period 1999 through 2001, of which approximately $1,395 million was
recognized in 2002 as inventory held by Cardinal and McKesson was worked down and approximately $422 million is projected to be recognized in 2003, a significant
portion of which is expected to be recognized in the first quarter of 2003. The corresponding effect on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest
and income taxes was an increase of $1,093 million in 2002. The corresponding projected effect on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and
income taxes for 2003 is an increase of approximately $290 million, a significant portion of which is expected to be recognized in the first quarter of 2003. Sales to
Cardinal and McKesson represented approximately 56%, 52%, and 41% of U.S. pharmaceuticals net sales in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.
The Company has determined that, although sales incentives were offered to other wholesalers and there was a buildup of inventories at such wholesalers, the
consignment model criteria discussed above were not met. Accordingly, the Company recognized revenue when the products were shipped to these wholesalers. The
Company estimates that the inventory of pharmaceutical products held by these other
24
U.S. pharmaceuticals wholesalers in excess of approximately one month of supply in the case of the Company's exclusive products, approximately one and a half
months of supply in the case of PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*, which are marketed under the Company's alliance with Sanofi-Synthelabo, and approximately two months
of supply in the case of the Company's non-exclusive products, was in the range of approximately $550 million to $750 million at December 31, 2001.
The Company's estimates of inventories held by wholesalers are based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for its products, as well as the
Company's analysis of third-party information, including information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to
customers and third-party market research data, and the Company's internal information. The Company's estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that
rely on third-party data, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations.
In April 2002, the Company disclosed the substantial buildup of wholesaler inventories in its U.S. pharmaceuticals business, and developed and subsequently
undertook a plan to work down in an orderly fashion these wholesaler inventory levels. To facilitate an orderly workdown, the Company's plan included continuing to
offer sales incentives, at reduced levels, to certain wholesalers. With respect to McKesson and Cardinal, the Company entered into agreements for an orderly
workdown that provide for these wholesalers to make specified levels of purchases and for the Company to offer specified levels of incentives through the workdown
period.
The Company expects that the orderly workdown of inventories of its pharmaceutical products held by all U.S. pharmaceuticals wholesalers will be substantially
completed at or before the end of 2003. The Company also expects that the consignment model criteria will no longer be met with respect to the Company's U.S.
pharmaceuticals sales to Cardinal and McKesson (other than the abovementioned sales related to OTN) at or before the end of 2003. At December 31, 2002, the
Company's aggregate cost of pharmaceutical products held by Cardinal and McKesson that were accounted for using the consignment model (and, accordingly, were
reflected as consignment inventory on the Company's consolidated balance sheet) was approximately $58 million. At December 31, 2002, the deferred revenue,
recorded at gross invoice sales price, related to such inventory was approximately $470 million, including approximately $39 million related to OTN. The Company
estimates, based on the data noted above, that the inventory of pharmaceutical products held by the other U.S. pharmaceuticals wholesalers in excess of or below
approximately one month of supply in the case of the Company's exclusive products, approximately one and a half months of supply in the case of PLAVIX* and
AVAPRO*, which are marketed under the Company's alliance with Sanofi-Synthelabo, and approximately two months of supply in the case of the Company's non-
exclusive products was in the range of approximately $100 million below this level of supply to $100 million in excess of this level of supply at December 31, 2002. This
estimate is subject to the inherent limitations noted above. The Company expects to account for certain pharmaceutical sales relating to OTN using the consignment
model until the abovementioned agreement with McKesson expires in 2006.
The Company's financial results and prior period and quarterly comparisons are affected by the buildup and orderly workdown of wholesaler inventories, as well
as the application of the consignment model to certain sales to certain wholesalers. In addition, with respect to sales not accounted for using the consignment model,
the Company's financial results and prior period and quarterly comparisons are affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of wholesalers, including the effect of
incentives offered, and the corresponding changes in inventory levels maintained by these wholesalers. These wholesaler buying patterns and wholesaler inventory
levels may not reflect underlying prescriber demand. For information on U.S. pharmaceuticals prescriber demand, reference is made to the table on page 31, which sets
forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total (both retail and mail order customers) prescription growth for certain of the Company's primary care
pharmaceutical products. The Company expects that when the consignment model is no longer being applied with respect to sales to
25
Cardinal or McKesson, the buying patterns and fluctuations in inventory levels of these wholesalers will have an effect on the Company's financial results and prior
period and quarterly comparisons.Earnings
In 2002, earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes increased 19% to $2,647 million from $2,218 million in 2001. Earnings from
continuing operations in 2002 of $2,034 million were consistent with the $2,043 million earned in 2001. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations were flat
with the prior year at $1.05, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 1% to $1.05 from $1.04 in the prior year. In 2001, earnings from
continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes decreased 58% to $2,218 million from $5,247 million in 2000. Earnings from continuing operations
decreased 47% in 2001 to $2,043 million from $3,830 million in 2000. Basic earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 46% to $1.05 in 2001 from $1.95 in
2000, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 46% to $1.04 in 2001 from $1.92 in 2000. Net earnings margins for continuing operations
decreased to 11.2% in 2002 from 11.4% in 2001 and 21.8% in 2000.
During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company recorded several items that affected the comparability of results of the periods presented
herein, which are set forth in the following table. For a discussion of these items, see Note 2, Alliances and Investments, Note 3, Restructuring and Other Items,
Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, and Note 5, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements.
2002 2001 2000
(dollars in millions)
Acquired in-process research and development $ 169 $ 2,772 $ 38
Litigation settlement charge 659 77 —
Asset impairment charge for ImClone 379 — —
Restructuring and other items(1) 68 638 483
Gain on sales of businesses/product lines (30) (475) (216)

Settlement of prior year tax matters (235) — —
$ 538 $ 1,936 $ 191
(1) $15 million of restructuring reversal and $58 million and $40 million of restructuring expense are included in cost of products sold in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. $69 million of accelerated depreciation on research facilities is included in research and development in 2002. $74 million of deductions and
customer chargebacks related to abandoned product lines are included as a reduction of net sales in 2001.
In 2001, the Company also incurred $61 million of costs related to the DuPont acquisition, of which $30 million is included in cost of products sold.
Gross margin percentages were 64.7%, 69.7% and 73.0% in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Gross margins were adversely impacted by generic competition and
a change in product mix.
The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes was 16.4% in 2002 compared with 3.3% in 2001
and 25.2% in 2000. The 2002 effective income tax rate includes an income tax benefit of $235 million due to the settlement of certain prior year tax matters and the
determination by the Company as to the expected settlement of ongoing tax litigation, partially offset by $192 million of valuation allowances, comprised of
$112 million related to
26
certain state net deferred tax assets, $45 million related to certain state tax net operating loss carryforwards and $35 million related to foreign tax credit carryforwards,
each of which the Company currently does not believe are more likely than not to be realized in the future. The low effective income tax rate in 2001 results primarily
from lower pre-tax income in the U.S., caused by the write-off of acquired in-process research and development, as well as proportionately greater income earned in
low-tax jurisdictions.
Expenses
Total costs and expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 85.4% in 2002 compared with 87.7% in 2001 and 70.1% in 2000.
Cost of products sold, as a percentage of sales, increased over the last three years to 35.3% in 2002 compared with 30.3% in 2001 and 27.0% in 2000, principally
due to increased sales of lower-margin products from OTN and from a decline in higher-margin GLUCOPHAGE* IR, TAXOL® and BUSPAR sales as a result of the
introduction of generic products in the U.S. Cost of products sold includes a $15 million reversal of prior period reserves for inventory write-offs related to actions
that have been cancelled in 2002 and $58 million and $40 million of other restructuring expense in 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Advertising and promotion expenses decreased slightly to $1,295 million in 2002 from $1,299 million in 2001, primarily as a result of reduced spending on the
metformin franchise and VANIQA*, partially offset by ABILIFY* product launch expenses and increased support of PLAVIX* and AVAPRO* in the U.S. In 2001,
advertising and promotion expenses decreased 15% from 2000 to $1,299 million as a result of lower spending on TAXOL® and BUSPAR. As a percentage of sales,
2002 advertising and promotion expenses decreased to 7.1% from 7.2% in 2001 and 8.7% in 2000.
Marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 21.7% in 2002 from 21.6% in 2001. The slight increase in 2002 was mainly
due to higher sales force expenses as a result of the addition of the Medical Imaging business, which was acquired in October 2001 as part of the DuPont acquisition.
In 2001, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased to 21.6% from 22.0% in 2000, primarily as a result of cost-efficiencies and a
reduction in sales force expenses.
The Company's investment in research and development totaled $2,218 million in 2002, an increase of 2% over 2001, and as a percentage of sales, increased to
12.2% in 2002, compared with 12.1% in 2001 and 10.7% in 2000. Research and development included $69 million of accelerated depreciation on research facilities in
2002. In 2002, research and development spending dedicated to pharmaceutical products increased to 14.4% of pharmaceutical sales compared with 14.2% and 12.4%
in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The lower growth in research and development spending in 2002 is consistent with the new priorities the Company announced to
ensure that the Company can fully realize the value of its research and development pipeline. The new priorities include rebalancing drug discovery and development
to increase support for the Company's full late-stage development pipeline. They also include devoting greater resources to ensuring successful near-term productlaunches and increasing the Company's efforts on in-licensing opportunities. Consistent with these priorities, the Company expects a mid-to-high teens increase on a
percentage basis to spending in advertising and promotion.
In 2002, the charges related to acquired in-process research and development were $169 million and primarily related to milestone payments to ImClone for
ERBITUX*. Of the $200 million milestone payable to ImClone, $160 million (or 80.1%) was expensed to acquired in-process research and development in the first
quarter of 2002. The remaining $40 million was recorded as an additional equity investment to eliminate the income statement effect of the portion of the milestone
payment for which the Company has an economic claim through its 19.9% ownership interest in ImClone. The
27
acquired in-process research and development charge in 2001 was $2,772 million, including $2,009 million related to the DuPont acquisition and $735 million
attributable to the ImClone equity investment. In addition, acquired in-process research and development for 2002, 2001 and 2000 include charges of $9 million,
$28 million and $38 million, respectively, for licensing payments related to products not yet approved for marketing.
Restructuring programs were implemented in 2002 to downsize, realign and streamline operations in order to increase productivity, reduce operating expenses
and rationalize the Company's manufacturing network and research facilities. The programs include costs for the termination of approximately 1,040 employees
including research, manufacturing and administrative personnel. In addition, the Company eliminated non-strategic research efforts and consolidated research
facilities in the U.S. Actions under the restructuring program are expected to be substantially complete by late 2003. As a result of these actions, the Company
expects the annual benefit to earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes to be approximately $150 million in future years.
Restructuring programs were implemented in 2001 to downsize, realign and streamline operations in order to increase productivity, reduce operating expenses
and rationalize the Company's manufacturing network and research facilities. The programs include costs for the termination of approximately 3,400 employees
including sales force, manufacturing, administrative and research personnel. In addition, a contract sales force has been terminated. The Company also exited a
nutritional business in Eastern Europe, a pharmaceutical production facility in the U.S. and a research facility in France. Actions under the restructuring program are
expected to be substantially complete in early 2003. As a result of these actions, the Company expects the annual benefit to earnings from continuing operations
before minority interest and income taxes to be approximately $400 million in future years, of which a portion was realized in 2002.
Restructuring programs were implemented in 2000 to downsize, realign and streamline operations in order to increase productivity, reduce operating expenses
and rationalize the Company's manufacturing network and research facilities. Under the program, approximately 5,200 employees were to be terminated, including
sales force, manufacturing and administrative personnel. In addition, the Company also exited a production facility in the U.S., certain international operations of
ConvaTec and a research facility in Japan. As a result of these actions, the Company expects the annual benefit to earnings from continuing operations before
minority interest and income taxes of approximately $275 million in future years, a majority of which has been realized. These actions are substantially complete.
For additional information on restructuring, see Note 3, Restructuring and Other Items, to the consolidated financial statements.
Business Segments
The Company operates in three reportable segments—Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals and Other Healthcare. The percent of the Company's sales by segment were
as follows:
% of Total Sales
2002 2001 2000
Pharmaceuticals 81 83 83
Nutritionals 10 10 10
Other Healthcare 9 7 7
Pharmaceuticals
In 2002, worldwide pharmaceuticals sales decreased 2% to $14,705 million, reflecting a 4% price decline, 2% volume increase, and no foreign exchange impact.
Domestic sales declined 7% to
28
$9,174 million, primarily due to generic competition in the U.S. on GLUCOPHAGE* IR, TAXOL® and BUSPAR, partially offset by increased sales of PLAVIX* and the
addition of products acquired from the DuPont acquisition, which was completed on October 1, 2001. In addition, the decrease in domestic pharmaceutical sales was
impacted by the buildup in the prior period of inventory levels at those U.S. wholesalers not accounted for under the consignment model and the subsequent
workdown in 2002. International sales increased 9% to $5,531 million (foreign exchange had no significant impact) primarily due to increased sales of PRAVACHOL
and PLAVIX* in Europe, TAXOL® in Japan and the addition of products acquired from the DuPont acquisition. Approximately $1,395 million of sales (calculated net
of customary 2% early pay cash discounts) recognized in the year ended December 31, 2002 had been reversed from prior years.
In 2001, worldwide pharmaceuticals sales increased 3% to $14,941 million, reflecting a 3% price increase, 2% volume increase partially offset by a 2% decrease in
foreign exchange. Domestic sales in 2001 increased 2% to $9,853 million primarily due to strong growth of PLAVIX*, PRAVACHOL, TEQUIN and GLUCOPHAGE* IR,
partially offset by decreased sales in TAXOL® and BUSPAR due to generic competition. In addition, the 2001 domestic sales increase reflects the favorable impact of
the previously disclosed buildup of inventory levels at those U.S. wholesalers not accounted for under the consignment model. International sales in 2001 increased
4% to $5,088 million, including a 6% decrease from foreign exchange, as a result of increased sales of PRAVACHOL in Europe, PLAVIX* internationally and
TAXOL® in Japan, partially offset by decreased sales of CAPOTEN.
Key pharmaceutical products and their sales include the following:
• Sales of PRAVACHOL, a cholesterol-lowering agent and the Company's largest-selling product, increased 8% to $2,266 million in 2002. Domestic sales
increased 1% to $1,311 million in 2002, while international sales increased 18% (foreign exchange had a 4% favorable impact) to $955 million. In
October 2002, the FDA approved a new indication for use in treating pediatric patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Additionally,
a six-month exclusivity extension was granted through April 2006. PRAVACHOL sales increased 19% to $2,101 million in 2001.• Sales from OTN, a specialty distributor of anticancer medicines and related products, increased 33% to $1,900 million in 2002 and 33% to $1,433 million
in 2001.
• Sales of PLAVIX*, a platelet aggregation inhibitor, increased 61% to $1,890 million in 2002, driven in part by the positive results of the CURE
(Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent ischemic Events) study. In addition, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart
Association issued updated guidelines adding PLAVIX* to standard therapy, including aspirin, to treat people with acute coronary syndrome. Sales
of AVAPRO*, an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension, increased 20% to $586 million in 2002. Sales of AVAPRO* and
PLAVIX* increased 35% and 32% to $487 million and $1,171 million, respectively, in 2001. AVAPRO* and PLAVIX* are cardiovascular products that
were launched from the alliance between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi-Synthelabo.
• GLUCOPHAGE* franchise sales decreased 67% to $778 million in 2002, compared to a 34% increase to $2,337 million in 2001. GLUCOPHAGE* IR, the
leading branded oral medication for treatment of non-insulin- dependent (type 2) diabetes, saw 2002 sales decrease 88% to $220 million. The decline in
GLUCOPHAGE* IR was due to the introduction of generic metformin in the U.S. in early 2002. GLUCOPHAGE* IR sales increased 7% to $1,838 million
in 2001. GLUCOVANCE*, an oral combination drug, and GLUCOPHAGE* XR Extended Release tablets had sales in 2002 of $246 million and
$297 million, respectively, compared with sales in 2001 of $269 million and $230 million, respectively. In 2002, the FDA approved METAGLIP*, a
combination of glipizide and metformin HCI tablets, as initial drug therapy for people with type 2 diabetes. Sales of METAGLIP* were $15 million in
2002.

• Sales of TAXOL® decreased 23% to $857 million in 2002. International sales increased 11% (foreign exchange had a 1% favorable impact), to
$719 million, led by strong sales in Japan and France. Domestic sales decreased 70% to $138 million due to generic competition. TAXOL® sales
decreased 29% to $1,112 million in 2001.
• Sales of PARAPLATIN, which is used in combination therapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer, increased 23% to $727 million in 2002.
PARAPLATIN sales decreased 9% to $592 million in 2001.
• Sales of ZERIT, an anti-retroviral drug used in the treatment of HIV, decreased 14% to $443 million in 2002, primarily as a result of decreased demand
due to adverse side effects. ZERIT sales decreased 11% to $515 million in 2001.
• MONOPRIL, a second-generation angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, had increased sales of 3% reaching $426 million in 2002.
MONOPRIL sales increased 2% to $413 million in 2001.
• Sales of SUSTIVA and COUMADIN, products acquired from DuPont in October 2001, were $455 million and $300 million, respectively, in 2002. Total
U.S. prescriptions for COUMADIN decreased 16% in 2002.
• Sales of VIDEX/VIDEX EC, an anti-retroviral agent, increased 9% to $262 million in 2002. VIDEX/VIDEX EC sales increased 16% to $240 million in 2001.
• Sales of SERZONE, a treatment for depression, decreased 34% to $221 million in 2002, primarily as a result of a labeling change indicating a serious
side effect of the product. SERZONE sales increased 5% to $334 million in 2001.

The following table sets forth a comparison of reported net sales changes and the estimated total (both retail and mail order customers) prescription growth for
certain of the Company's U.S. primary care pharmaceutical products. The estimated prescription growth amounts are based on third-party data. A significant portion
of the Company's domestic pharmaceutical sales is made to wholesalers. Where changes in reported net sales differs from prescription growth, this change in net
sales may not reflect underlying prescriber demand.

Earnings before minority interest and income taxes in 2002 and 2001 were $2,413 million and $1,158 million, respectively. The increase in 2002 is mainly due to
lowered earnings in 2001 as a result of the write-off of $2,772 million of acquired in-process research and development. Earnings in 2002 were unfavorably affected by
higher sales of lower margin products, including products from the OTN business, and the full year impact of generic competition on GLUCOPHAGE* IR, TAXOL®
and BUSPAR in the U.S. Earnings before minority interest and income taxes of $1,158 million in 2001 decreased from $4,371 million in 2000, primarily due to the
acquired in-process research and development expenses in 2001, together with the impact of generic competition on TAXOL® and BUSPAR in the U.S.
Nutritionals
In 2002, Nutritionals sales were comparable to the prior year level at $1.8 billion, reflecting a 3% increase due to price, offset by a 2% decrease due to volume and
a 1% decrease due to foreign exchange. Worldwide infant formula sales decreased 4% to $1,176 million, primarily in the specialty infant formula business. Worldwide
sales of ENFAMIL, the Company's largest-selling infant formula, of $750 million in 2002 were consistent with $753 million in 2001. Mead Johnson continues to be the
leader in the U.S. infant formula markets. Worldwide children's nutritionals sales increased 24%, including a 2% decrease from foreign exchange, to $383 million in
2002 from $308 million in 2001, as a result of a 53% increase in sales of ENFAGROW, primarily across the Pacific region, to $121 million in 2002. Sales of ENFAGROW
increased 34% to $79 million in 2001. In 2001, Nutritionals sales were flat with prior year at $1.8 billion, reflecting a 3% increase due to price, offset by a 1% decrease
due to volume and a 2% decrease due to foreign exchange. Worldwide infant formula sales increased 3%, including a 1% decrease from foreign exchange, to
$1,226 million in 2001, primarily due to a 5% increase in sales of ENFAMIL. Worldwide adult nutritional sales decreased 15% to $143 million from $169 million in 2000as a result of the divestiture of the VIACTIV* business.
Earnings before minority interest and income taxes in the Nutritionals segment decreased to $444 million in 2002 from $482 million in 2001 as a result of increased
promotional spending and sales force expense related to the ENFAMIL product line. In 2001, earnings before minority interest and income taxes in the Nutritionals
segment increased to $482 million from $348 million in 2000 primarily due to copromotion income for CEFZIL from the Pharmaceuticals segment and lower advertising
and promotion spending on VIACTIV*.
31
Other Healthcare
The Other Healthcare segment includes ConvaTec, the Medical Imaging business and Consumer Medicines in the U.S. and Japan.
Sales in the Other Healthcare segment increased 30% to $1,586 million in 2002, including $465 million of sales from Medical Imaging, which was purchased in
October 2001 as part of the DuPont acquisition. The Other Healthcare sales increase was a result of a 28% increase due to volume and a 2% increase from changes in
selling prices. Foreign exchange did not have a net impact on the sales change. In 2001, sales in this segment increased 6% to $1,219 million from $1,152 million in
2000. In 2001, the Other Healthcare sales increase was a result of a 9% increase due to volume, 1% increase from changes in selling prices and 4% decrease due to
foreign exchange. Other Healthcare sales by business were as follows:

Consumer Medicines 377 413 467 (9) (12)
Total Other Healthcare $ 1,586 $ 1,219 $ 1,152 30 6
In 2002, the increase in ConvaTec sales was due to a 3% increase in sales of ostomy products to $459 million and strong growth of wound care products, which
increased 11% to $276 million. Foreign exchange contributed 1% to the sales increase in 2002. In 2001, the increase in ConvaTec sales was due to a 4% increase in
sales of ostomy products to $444 million and strong growth of wound care products, which increased 9% to $248 million. Foreign exchange in 2001 had a 4% negative
effect on sales.
The steady decline in sales of Consumer Medicines, from $467 million in 2000 to $377 million in 2002, is primarily a result of lower demand for analgesics and KERI
products in the U.S.
Earnings before minority interest and income taxes in the Other Healthcare segment increased to $394 million in 2002 from $287 million in 2001, primarily due to the
strong growth in the ConvaTec business and the addition of the Medical Imaging business in October 2001. Earnings before minority interest and income taxes in
this segment increased to $287 million in 2001 from $252 million in 2000, primarily due to the addition of the Medical Imaging business.
Geographic Areas
The Company's products are available in virtually every country in the world. The largest markets are in the U.S., France, Japan, Germany, Spain, Canada and
Italy.
Sales in the U.S. decreased 3% in 2002, primarily due to generic competition in the U.S. on GLUCOPHAGE* IR, TAXOL® and BUSPAR and, to a lesser extent,
the buildup in the prior period of inventory levels at those U.S. wholesalers not accounted for under the consignment model and the subsequent workdown in 2002.
This decrease was partially offset by an increase in PLAVIX* sales and the addition of the products acquired from DuPont. DuPont pharmaceuticals U.S. sales in
2002 were $603 million. In 2001, sales in the U.S. increased 2%, primarily due to the growth of PLAVIX*, PRAVACHOL and GLUCOPHAGE* IR, offset by declines in
TAXOL® and BUSPAR. DuPont pharmaceuticals U.S. sales in 2001 were $106 million. The Company's acquisition of DuPont was completed on October 1, 2001. For
information on U.S. pharmaceuticals prescriber demand, reference is made to the table on page 31, which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the
estimated
32
total (both retail and mail order customers) prescription growth for certain of the Company's primary care pharmaceutical products.
Sales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa increased 12% in 2002, including a 4% increase from foreign exchange, as a result of the strong growth of PRAVACHOL in
France and the United Kingdom, PLAVIX* in Spain, and the addition of the DuPont products throughout the region. DuPont sales in the region were $309 million in
2002. In 2001, sales in Europe, Mid-East and Africa increased 6%, including a 4% decrease from foreign exchange, primarily due to the growth of PRAVACHOL in
France and Italy.
Sales in Other Western Hemisphere countries decreased 6%, including an 8% decrease from foreign exchange in 2002. The unfavorable impact of foreign
exchange was primarily in Brazil and Argentina. The underlying sales growth was primarily due to increased sales of PLAVIX* in Canada and increased sales of
nutritional products in Mexico. In 2001, sales in the Other Western Hemisphere countries decreased 2%, including a 5% decrease from foreign exchange. The
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange was mainly in Brazil. The underlying sales growth in 2001 was primarily driven by increased sales of nutritional products in
Mexico.
Sales in the Pacific region increased 12%, including a 2% decrease from foreign exchange in 2002. Products with strong growth included TAXOL® and
PARAPLATIN in Japan and nutritional products in China and Indonesia. In 2001, Pacific region sales decreased 1%, including a 12% decrease from foreign exchange.
The underlying sales growth in 2001 was driven primarily by the strong growth of TAXOL® in Japan and nutritional products in the Philippines, Thailand and China.Financial Position
Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities totaled approximately $4.0 billion at December 31, 2002, compared with $5.7 billion at
December 31, 2001. Approximately $3.7 billion of such cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities was held by the Company's foreign
subsidiaries. Repatriation of this cash to the U.S. would require additional tax provisions, which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. For a
further discussion of this matter, see Critical Accounting Policies-Income Taxes below. Working capital decreased to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2002, from
$2.1 billion at December 31, 2001, primarily as a result of a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, and an increase in commercial paper outstanding, partially offset by
lower deferred revenue on consigned inventory. Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, marketable securities and the conversion of other working-capital items
are expected to fund near-term operations.
Cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities at December 31, 2002, were denominated primarily in U.S. dollar instruments with near-term
maturities. The average interest yield on cash and cash equivalents was 1.5% and 2.0% at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, while interest yields on time
deposits and marketable securities averaged 1.3% and 1.7%, respectively.
Short-term borrowings and long-term debt at December 31, 2002, are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars but also include Japanese yen long-term debt of
$102 million. A majority of the Company's debt is fixed rate. The Company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps for $3.0 billion of its long-term debt.
Interest expense in 2002, 2001 and 2000 was $410 million, $182 million and $108 million, respectively. The average interest rate on short-term borrowings was 9.58%
and 7.41% and on current installments of long-term debt was 2.77% and 4.03%, in each case at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2002, the Company's
long-term credit ratings, from both Moody's and Standard and Poor's credit rating agencies, were reduced from Aaa/AAA to Aa2 and AA, respectively. In
December 2002, Moody's placed the Company's long-term and short-term debt ratings under review for possible downgrade. Since then, the Company has held
discussions with Moody's and has provided additional information requested to facilitate their review. In March 2003, Moody's confirmed the
33
Prime-1 short-term ratings for the Company. The Company's long-term ratings remain under review for a possible downgrade.
Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.0 billion in 2002, $5.4 billion in 2001 and $4.7 billion in 2000. The decrease in 2002 is attributable to
lower net earnings and income tax cash outflows of $2.1 billion, which is primarily related to taxes on the gain arising from the sale of the Clairol business. Cash flow
from operations also included pension contributions of $547 million, $300 million and $267 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Cash provided from operations was primarily used over the past three years to pay dividends of $6.2 billion and repurchase 73 million shares at a cost of
$4.1 billion. The Company has also invested $2.6 billion over the past three years in capital expansion to improve plant efficiency and maintain superior research
facilities.
During 2002, the Company purchased 5 million shares of common stock at a cost of $164 million, bringing the total shares acquired since the share repurchase
program's inception to 372 million shares. The Company repurchased 27 million and 41 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1,589 million and $2,338 million in
2001 and 2000, respectively. The share repurchase program authorizes the Company to purchase common stock from time to time in the open market or through
private transactions as market conditions permit. This program is intended to reduce the increase in shares outstanding from option exercises and to obtain shares for
general corporate purposes.
Employment levels of 44,000 at December 2002 decreased from prior-year levels of 46,000 as a result of workforce reductions associated with restructuring
activities and overall attrition.
Dividends declared per common share in 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $1.12, $1.11 and $1.01, respectively. In December 2002, the Company declared a quarterly
dividend of $.280 per common share and an indicated dividend for the full year 2003 of $1.12 per share.

Note 19, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements.
On March 5, 2002, the Company and ImClone revised their agreement, reducing the total payment to $900 million from $1 billion. Pursuant to this agreement, the
Company paid ImClone $200 million in 2001, $140 million in 2002, and $60 million in 2003 and will pay an aggregate of $500 million upon
34achievement of two milestones. For a discussion of the Company's agreement with ImClone, see Note 2, Alliances and Investments, to the consolidated financial
statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). FIN 46
requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's
activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity's residual returns or both. FIN 46 also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not
required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities
created after January 31, 2003 and to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain of the disclosure requirements
apply to all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The Company is in the process of
assessing what impact this pronouncement will have on its consolidated financial statements. Based on its preliminary analysis of the impact of FIN 46, the Company
believes that it is reasonably possible that ImClone could meet the criteria to be considered a variable interest entity in relation to the Company. Accordingly, the
Company included the required transitional disclosures of FIN 46 in Note 2, Alliances and Investments, to the consolidated financial statements.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. The provisions of SFAS No. 148 are effective for financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 148 did not have a
material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements as the adoption of this standard did not require the Company to change, and the Company does
not plan to change, to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation.
In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize a liability at the inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the obligation
undertaken in issuing the guarantee and include more detailed disclosure with respect to guarantees. The types of contracts the Company enters into that meet the
scope of this interpretation are financial and performance standby letters of credit on behalf of wholly-owned subsidiaries. FIN 45 is effective for guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002. The initial adoption of this accounting pronouncement did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial
statements.
In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Exit or Disposal Activities, effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after
December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 146 addresses issues regarding the recognition, measurement, and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and/or disposal
activities, including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) has set forth in
EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring), and the SEC has set forth in the Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 100, Restructuring and Impairment Charges. The initial adoption of this accounting
standard did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
35
In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, which superseded SFAS No. 4 and the requirement to aggregate all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt
and to classify, if material, as an extraordinary item, net of related income tax effect. As a result, the criteria in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 will be used
to classify those gains and losses. SFAS No. 145 also amends SFAS No. 13 to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale-
leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale-leaseback transactions. The initial adoption of this standard did not materially affect the
Company's consolidated financial statements.
In 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-
Lived Assets. See Note 1, Accounting Policies, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information.
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Under SFAS No. 143, the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation must be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs
are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. The provisions of SFAS No. 143 are effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2002. The initial adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Retirement Benefits
Plan Description
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for regular full-time employees. The principal
defined benefit pension plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Retirement Income Plan and the principal defined contribution plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Savings and
Investment Program.
Approximately 85% of total Company defined benefit pension plan assets and liabilities are held in U.S. plans. The assets for the U.S. plans are held in a single
trust with a common asset allocation. Unless specified otherwise, the references in this section are to total Company plans (U.S. plans together with international
plans).
Benefits under the Company's defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of credited service and on participants' compensation. Assets under
the Company's defined benefit plans consist primarily of equity and fixed-income securities. At December 31, 2002, the fair market value of plan assets for the
Company's defined benefit plans decreased to $3,267 million from $3,508 million at December 31, 2001. For the U.S. plans, assets were allocated 67% to equity
securities (compared to 70% at the end of 2001), 26% to fixed income securities (compared to 23% at the end of 2001) and 7% to real estate and other investments (no
change from the end of 2001). Bristol-Myers Squibb common stock represented less than 1% of assets for the U.S. plans at the end of 2002 and 2001.
The Company provides comprehensive medical and group life benefits for substantially all U.S. retirees who elect to participate in the Company's comprehensive
medical and group life plans. The asset allocation for these postretirement plans is identical to the asset allocation described above for the U.S. defined benefit
pension plans.
Accrual Accounting and Significant Assumptions
Consistent with the GAAP requirements set forth in SFAS No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, the Company accounts for pension benefits using theaccrual method, recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees. The accrual method of accounting for pension benefits necessarily requires
actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments.
36
The Company's key assumptions used in calculating its cost of pension benefits are the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected long-
term rate of return on plan assets. The Company, in consultation with its actuaries, evaluates the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in
calculating its cost of pension benefits, such as retirement, turnover and mortality rates, based on expectations or actual experience, as appropriate, and determines
such assumptions on December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year. Depending on the
assumptions used, the pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can
materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and
other factors.
The assumed discount rate used by the Company for determining future pension obligations under the U.S. plans is based on indices of AA and AAA-rated
corporate bonds. The indices of high quality corporate bonds selected reflect the weighted-average remaining period of benefit payments. The assumed rate of
compensation increase used by the Company for determining future pension obligations reflects an estimate of the change in actual future compensation levels due
to general price levels, productivity, seniority and other factors.
In 2002, net pension expense for the Company's defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before minority interest and income taxes was $45 million,
compared to $77 million in 2001 (which included $25 million for a U.S. curtailment/settlement loss).
The U.S. plans pension expense for 2002 was determined using a 7.25% assumed discount rate and a 4.25% assumed rate of compensation increase. The
accumulated benefit obligation at December 31, 2002 for the U.S. plans was determined using a 6.75% assumed discount rate. If the assumed discount rate used in
determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2002 had been reduced by 0.5%, such expense would have increased by approximately $14 million. If the assumed rate
of compensation increase used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2002 had been reduced by 0.25%, such expense would have decreased by
approximately $5 million. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated benefit obligation at December 31, 2001 had been reduced by 0.5%, the
accumulated benefit obligation would have increased by $217 million.
In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company evaluates allocation of assets and the expected returns on various asset
classes. The Company evaluates any short-term market volatility in the context of the long-term nature of pension commitments. The U.S. plans' pension expense for
2002 was determined using a 10% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining the U.S.
plans pension expense for 2002 had been reduced by 1%, such expense would have increased by $35 million.
Actual rates of return earned on U.S. plan assets for each of the last ten years were as follows:
Year Return Year Return
2002 (13.4%) 1997 22.2%
2001 (6.1%) 1996 17.0%
2000 3.5% 1995 23.0%
1999 18.2% 1994 0.0%
1998 13.3% 1993 13.5%
As discussed below, accounting principles provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of
employees.
At December 31, 2001, the Company lowered its assumed discount rate from 7.75% to 7.25%, to reflect a decline in yields on high quality corporate bonds, and its
assumed rate of compensation increase from 4.75% to 4.25%, to reflect expectations of lower inflation in the future and consistent
37
with the reduction in the assumed discount rate. The reduction in the assumed discount rate increased the present value of future benefit obligations and,
accordingly, had the effect of increasing U.S. plans pension expense for 2002. In contrast, a reduction in the assumed rate of compensation increase decreased the
present value of benefit obligations and, accordingly, had the effect of decreasing U.S. plans pension expense for 2002.
At December 31, 2002, the Company further lowered its assumed discount rate for U.S. plans from 7.25% to 6.75% and its assumed rate of compensation increase
for U.S. plans from 4.25% to 4%. In the aggregate, these revisions had the effect of increasing the present value of future benefit obligations and, accordingly, will
have the effect of increasing pension expense for 2003. In addition, the Company revised, based on a change in its expectations of future terminations and
retirements, its retirement and turnover assumptions. This revision had the effect of decreasing the present value of future benefit obligations and, accordingly, will
have the effect of decreasing pension expense for 2003.
Over the course of the last several years, global equity markets have experienced negative returns. The negative equity market returns of 2001 and 2000 have
been compounded by a further market decline in 2002 (S&P 500 declined by 22.1%). The Company evaluates market conditions in determining its expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets. The Company reduced the expected rate of return on U.S. plans assets at December 31, 2002 from 10% to 9%. This reduction is expected
to result in higher pension expense for 2003 of approximately $34 million.
The Company expects that the net pension expense for its defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before minority interest and income taxes will be
approximately $120 million higher in 2003 than in 2002, reflecting, among other things, the decreases in the assumed discount rate and expected long-term rate of
return outlined above and a decrease in the value of the assets in the Company's defined benefit pension plans.
The Company used the same assumed discount rates and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets in calculating its cost of postretirement benefits as it
did in calculating its cost of pension benefits.
Delayed Recognition of Actuarial Gains and Losses
At December 31, 2002 and 2001, unrecognized net actuarial losses for the Company's defined benefit plans were $1,635 million and $645 million, respectively,
based on the fair market value of plan assets. These unrecognized net actuarial losses reflect a decline in the fair market value of plan assets and a reduction of theweighted-average discount rate in 2002 and 2001.
SFAS No. 87 provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses, including amounts arising from changes in the estimated plan benefit obligations
due to changes in the assumed discount rate, differences between the actual and expected returns on plan assets, and other assumption changes. SFAS No. 87
requires that unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss, determined based on the market-related value of plan assets (which differs from fair market value and is a
calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years), be amortized in pension income or expense
for the year to the extent that such unrecognized net actuarial loss or gain exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of
plan assets at the beginning of the year. These net gains and losses are recognized as pension income or expense prospectively over a period that approximates the
average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans (approximately 10 years) to the extent that they are not offset by
losses and gains in subsequent years.
At December 31, 2001, the unrecognized net actuarial loss, determined based on the market-related value of plan assets, was $180 million. This amount did not
exceed 10% of the greater of the
38
projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year and, accordingly, was not required to be amortized as pension
expense for 2002. At December 31, 2002, the unrecognized net actuarial loss, determined based on the market-related value of plan assets, was $971 million. This
amount exceeded 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets by $565 million. Unless offset by future
unrecognized gains from higher discount rates or higher than expected returns on plan assets, amortization of this $565 million unrecognized loss is expected to
increase pension expense for each of the following ten years by approximately $57 million per year, which amount is reflected in the expected increase in pension
expense for 2003 of approximately $120 million compared to 2002.
In the event the fair market value of pension plan assets of a particular plan is less than the accumulated benefit obligation for such plan at year-end, GAAP may
require an additional minimum liability and, in such circumstances, a reduction in stockholders' equity or an establishment of an intangible asset. At December 31,
2002, fair market value of the Company's defined benefit pension plan assets was $3,267 million, and the related accumulated benefit obligation was $3,500 million. At
December 31, 2001, the fair market value of the Company's defined benefit pension plans assets was $3,508 million and the related accumulated benefit obligation was
$3,300 million. The Company recognized an additional minimum liability of $138 million at December 31, 2002, which was offset by the creation of a $10 million
intangible asset and $128 million charge in other comprehensive income included in stockholders' equity. The Company also recognized an additional minimum
liability of approximately $37 million and $17 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Plan Funding
The Company's funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts to provide for current service and to fund past service liability. The Company
contributed to the defined benefit plans $547 million, $300 million and $267 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The recent decline in the global equity markets
has resulted in a decrease in the value of the assets in the Company's pension plans. This decline is expected to adversely affect the Company's related accounting
results in future periods through higher pension expense and increased cash funding requirements.
The Company's contribution to the defined contribution plans is based on employee contributions and the level of Company match. The Company contributed
to the principal defined contribution plan $50 million, $54 million and $53 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Critical Accounting Policies
The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities, at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company's critical accounting policies are those that are
both most important to the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of
management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of the uncertainty of
factors surrounding the estimates or judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, actual results may vary from these estimates.
The Company believes that the following represent its critical accounting policies. For a summary of all of the Company's significant accounting policies,
including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1, Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements. Management
39
and the Company's independent accountants have discussed the Company's critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the board of directors.
Revenue Recognition
The Company's accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on its reported results and relies on certain estimates that require the most
difficult, subjective and complex judgments on the part of management. The Company recognizes revenue for sales upon shipment of product to its customers, except
in the case of certain transactions with its U.S. pharmaceuticals wholesalers which are accounted for using the consignment model. Under GAAP, revenue is
recognized when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred. In the case of sales made to wholesalers (1) as a result of incentives, (2) in
excess of the wholesaler's ordinary course of business inventory level, (3) at a time when there was an understanding, agreement, course of dealing or consistent
business practice that the Company would extend incentives based on levels of excess inventory in connection with future purchases and (4) at a time when such
incentives would cover substantially all, and vary directly with, the wholesaler's cost of carrying inventory in excess of the wholesaler's ordinary course of business
inventory level, substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership do not transfer upon shipment and, accordingly, such sales should be accounted for using the
consignment model. The determination of when, if at all, sales to a wholesaler meet the foregoing criteria involves evaluation of a variety of factors and a number of
complex judgments. Under the consignment model, the Company does not recognize revenue upon shipment of product. Rather, upon shipment of product the
Company invoices the wholesaler, records deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price and classifies the inventory held by the wholesalers as consignment
inventory at the Company's cost of such inventory. The Company recognizes revenue (net of discounts, rebates, sales allowances and accruals for returns, all of
which involve significant estimates and judgments) when the consignment inventory is no longer subject to incentive arrangements but not later than when such
inventory is sold through to the wholesalers' customers, on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis.
The Company's estimates of inventory at the wholesalers and deferred revenue on consigned inventory are based on the projected prescription demand-based
sales for its products, as well as the Company's analysis of third-party information, including information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to theirinventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and the Company's internal information. The Company's estimates are subject to
inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party data, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations.
Acquired In-Process Research and Development
The fair value of in-process research and development acquired in a business combination (acquired IPR&D) is determined by independent appraisal and based
on the present value of each research project's projected cash flows, utilizing an income approach consistent with the AICPA Practice Aid, Assets Acquired in
Business Combinations to be Used in Research and Development Activities: A Focus in Software, Electronic Devices and Pharmaceutical Industries. Future cash
flows are predominately based on the net income forecast of each project consistent with historical pricing, margins and expense levels of similar products. Revenues
are estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors, expected industry trends, individual project life cycles and the life of each research project's
underlying patent. In determining the fair value of each research project, expected revenues are first adjusted for technical risk of completion. The resulting cash
flows are then discounted at a rate approximating the Company's weighted average cost of capital.
40
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined
to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to
determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If
quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash
flows. The Company reports an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value.
Goodwill is evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142 requires that
goodwill be tested for impairment using a two-step process. The first step is to identify a potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of the
impairment loss, if any. Goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. SFAS No. 142 requires
that indefinite-lived intangible assets be tested for impairment using a one-step process, which consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the
intangible asset. Intangible assets are deemed to be impaired if the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value.
The estimates of future cash flows, based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management's judgment. Any changes in key
assumptions about the Company's businesses and their prospects, or changes in market conditions, could result in an impairment charge.
Equity Investments
The Company reviews its equity investments for impairment based on its determination of whether the decline in market value of the investment below the
Company's carrying value is other than temporary. In making this determination, the Company considers Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity
Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, which sets forth factors to be evaluated in determining whether a loss in value should be recognized,
including the Company's ability to hold its investment, the market price and market price fluctuations of the investment's publicly traded shares and inability of the
investee to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment. The Company's investment in ImClone is subject to this
accounting. See Note 2, Alliances and Investments, to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's investment in ImClone.
Retirement Benefits
The Company's pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by SFAS No. 87, Employers' Accounting
for Pensions, and SFAS No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. The Company considers accounting for retirement plans
critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, salary growth,
long-term return on plan assets, retirement, turnover, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates. Depending on the assumptions and estimates used, the pension
and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially
affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding. For a detailed discussion of the Company's retirement benefits, see —Retirement Benefits above, and
Note 20, Retirement Plans,
41
and Note 21, Postretirement Benefit Plans Other Than Pensions, to the consolidated financial statements.
Restructuring
To downsize and streamline operations and rationalize manufacturing facilities, the Company has periodically recorded restructuring charges. As a result, the
Company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans, including future termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the
restructuring actions take place. Actual results could vary from these estimates resulting in an adjustment to earnings.
Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide
range of matters, including product liability, environmental liability and tax matters. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, the Company
records accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. For a discussion of
contingencies, reference is made to Note 8, Income Taxes, and Note 22, Litigation Matters, to the consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes
As of December 31, 2002, taxes were not provided on approximately $9.0 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, as the Company has invested or
expects to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely. If in the future these earnings are repatriated to the United States, or if the Company determines such
earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future, additional tax provisions would be required. Due to complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would
have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the amounts of income taxes that would have to be provided.
The Company evaluates the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance by assessing whether it is more likely than not that it will realize its deferred tax
assets in the future. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgement including the forecast of future taxable
income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowance are made to earnings in the period when such assessmentis made.
42
In addition, the Company has operations in tax jurisdictions located in most areas of the world and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. Tax audits by their
nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make estimates and judgments with respect
to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary from these estimates.
Outlook for 2003
The Company currently expects 2003 sales growth to more closely reflect underlying prescription trends. Sales growth is expected to benefit from the absence of
significant inventory workdown at wholesalers not on the consignment model.
Expected 2003 sales growth drivers are several key products, including, PLAVIX*, AVAPRO*, PRAVACHOL, PARAPLATIN, ABILIFY* and the expected
introduction of atazanavir, subject to FDA approval, as well as growth in the OTN business. The Company also expects significant sales growth for SUSTIVA and
CARDIOLITE, products obtained through the October 2001 acquisition of DuPont Pharmaceuticals. Partially offsetting the growth drivers are the expected loss of
exclusivity in 2003 for several products, including MONOPRIL, SERZONE and GLUCOPHAGE* XR in the U.S. and TAXOL® in Europe.
Gross margins for 2003 are expected to be consistent with gross margins for 2002, as the adverse impact of generic competition and changes in product mix are
expected to be offset by the growth of new products and continued growth of current key products.
The Company plans to increase product advertising and promotion in 2003 by approximately the mid-to high teens on a percentage basis focusing on support for
ABILIFY*, AVAPRO*, PLAVIX* and PRAVACHOL. Research and development expenses are expected to be comparable to 2002, with continued rebalancing of drug
discovery and development to provide additional support for late-stage development pipeline. Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in
the single digits on a percentage basis. Underlying drivers of operating expense growth in 2003 include expected higher pension cost, which is estimated to
negatively impact earnings before minority interest and income taxes by approximately $120 million, and, to a lesser extent, the expected increase in sales force
expense due to full-year ABILIFY* sales force support and fewer open sales force positions compared to 2002. Minority interest expense is expected to increase, due
to higher sales of products in the worldwide alliance with Sanofi.
The Company projects fully diluted earnings per share in 2003 will be $1.60 to $1.65, excluding the impact from any in-process research and development that may
arise from any external development agreements and other non-comparable items.
The Company expects the consignment model will no longer be applied to sales to any U.S. pharmaceuticals wholesalers at or before the end of 2003, except as to
sales under the distribution agreement related to OTN. Thereafter, the Company expects buying patterns and fluctuations in inventory levels of wholesalers will have
an effect on the Company's financial results and the comparability to prior periods.
Actual results may differ materially from the estimates and expectations described above. Some of the factors that could affect these estimates and expectations
are described below under —Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results.
Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results
This annual report on Form 10-K (including documents incorporated by reference) and other written and oral statements the Company makes from time to time
contain certain "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
43
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as "should", "expect", "anticipate", "estimate",
"may", "will", "project", "guidance", "intend", "plan", "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of
future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change
any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, the
Company's goals, plans and projections regarding the Company's financial position, results of operations, market position, product development, product approvals,
sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and financial results
which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next
several years.
Although it is not possible to predict or identify all factors, they may include the following:
• New government laws and regulations, such as (i) health care reform initiatives in the United States at the state and federal level and in other
countries; (ii) changes in the FDA and foreign regulatory approval processes that may cause delays in approving, or preventing the approval of, new
products; (iii) tax changes such as the phasing out of tax benefits heretofore available in the United States and certain foreign countries; and (iv) new
laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing.
• Competitive factors, such as (i) new products developed by competitors that have lower prices or superior performance features or that are otherwise
competitive with the Company's current products; (ii) generic competition as its products mature and patents expire on products; (iii) technological
advances and patents attained by competitors; (iv) problems with licensors, suppliers and distributors; and (v) business combinations among the
Company's competitors or major customers.
• Difficulties and delays inherent in product development, manufacturing and sale, such as (i) products that may appear promising in development may
fail to reach market for numerous reasons, including efficacy or safety concerns, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and the
difficulty or excessive cost to manufacture; (ii) seizure or recall of products; (iii) the failure to obtain, the imposition of limitations on the use of, or loss
of patent and other intellectual property rights; (iv) failure to comply with Current Good Manufacturing Practices and other application regulations and
quality assurance guidelines that could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns, product shortages and delays in product manufacturing; and
(v) other manufacturing or distribution problems.
• Legal difficulties, any of which can preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including (i) intellectual property
disputes; (ii) adverse decisions in litigation, including product liability and commercial cases; (iii) the inability to obtain adequate insurance withrespect to this type of liability; (iv) recalls of pharmaceutical products or forced closings of manufacturing plants; (v) government investigations;
(vi) claims asserting violations of securities, antitrust and other laws; (vii) environmental matters; and (viii) tax liabilities.
• Increasing pricing pressures worldwide, including rules and practices of managed care groups and institutional and governmental purchasers, judicial
decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement and pricing in
general.
44
• Fluctuations in buying patterns of major distributors, retail chains and other trade buyers which may result from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler
buying decisions or other factors (including the effect of incentives offered), the Company's wholesaler inventory management policies (including the
workdown of wholesaler inventory levels) or other factors.
• Greater than expected costs and other difficulties including unanticipated effects and difficulties of acquisitions, dispositions and other events,
including obtaining regulatory approvals occurring in connection with evolving business strategies; legal defense costs, insurance expense,
settlement costs and the risk of an adverse decision related to litigation.
• Changes to advertising and promotional spending and other categories of spending that may affect sales.
• Changes in the Company's structure resulting from acquisitions, divestitures, mergers, restructurings or other strategic initiatives.
• Economic factors over which the Company has no control such as changes of business and economic conditions including, but not limited to,
changes in interest rates and fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates.
• Changes in business, political and economic conditions due to the recent terrorist attacks in the U.S., the threat of future terrorist activity in the U.S.
and other parts of the world and related U.S. military action overseas.
• Changes in accounting standards promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission or the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which may require adjustments to financial statements.
Although the Company believes it has been prudent in its plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking
statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company
undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
The Company is exposed to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. To reduce that risk, the Company enters into certain
derivative financial instruments, when available on a cost-effective basis, to hedge its underlying economic exposure. These instruments also are managed on a
consolidated basis to efficiently net exposures and thus take advantage of any natural offsets. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading purposes.
Gains and losses on hedging transactions are offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged.
Foreign exchange option contracts and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated transactions. The Company's primary foreign currency exposures in
relation to the U.S. dollar are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Mexican peso.
The table below summarizes the Company's outstanding foreign exchange contracts as of December 31, 2002. The fair value of foreign exchange option contracts
is estimated by using the Black-Scholes model and is based on year-end currency rates. The fair value of option contracts and
45
forward contracts should be viewed in relation to the fair value of the underlying hedged transactions and the overall reduction in exposure to adverse fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates.

Total Contracts $ 1,775 $ 41At December 31, 2001, the Company held option contracts with an aggregate notional amount and fair value of $485 million and $24 million, respectively. These
contracts primarily related to the right to buy Japanese yen, and the right to sell Canadian and Australian dollars. The Company also held foreign exchange forward
contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $902 million and fair value of ($1) million. These contracts primarily related to exposures in the euro, Mexican peso,
Japanese yen and British pound.
The Company uses derivative instruments as part of its interest rate risk management policy. The derivative instruments used include interest rate swaps, which
are subject to fair-value hedge accounting treatment. During 2002, the Company executed with five financial institutions several fixed to floating interest rate swaps to
convert $3.0 billion of the Company's fixed rate debt to be paid in 2006 and 2011 to variable rate debt. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recognized
a reduction of interest expense of $23 million that reflects the benefit of the lower floating rate obtained in the swap agreement. SFAS No. 133 requires the revaluation,
at fair value, of the swap contracts as well as the underlying debt being hedged. As such, the swap contracts and the underlying debt have been revalued resulting in
an increase in the current assets and long-term debt of $133 million. Swap contracts are generally held to maturity and are not used for trading or speculative
purposes. The following table summarizes the interest rate swaps executed in 2002:

The Company also has outstanding several interest rate and foreign currency swaps related to Japanese yen notes due through 2005. The aggregate fair value of
these instruments as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $1 million and $(3) million, respectively.
The Company had $6,261 million and $6,237 million of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. See Note 15, Short-Term
Borrowings and Long-Term Debt, and Note 17, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities with various financial institutions, in order to limit exposure to any
one financial institution. These financial institutions are located primarily in the U.S. and Europe.

BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and all of its controlled majority owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. The most significant assumptions are employed in estimates used in determining values of intangible assets, restructuring charges and
accruals, sales rebate and return accruals, legal contingencies and tax assets and tax liabilities, as well as in estimates used in applying the revenue recognition policy
and accounting for retirement and postretirement benefits (including the actuarial assumptions). Actual results could differ from estimated results.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue for sales upon shipment of product to its customers, except in the case of certain transactions with its U.S. pharmaceuticals
wholesalers which are accounted for using the consignment model. Under GAAP, revenue is recognized when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
have transferred. In the case of sales made to wholesalers (1) as a result of incentives, (2) in excess of the wholesaler's ordinary course of business inventory level,
(3) at a time when there was an understanding, agreement, course of dealing or consistent business practice that the Company would extend incentives based on
levels of excess inventory in connection with future purchases and (4) at a time when such incentives would cover substantially all, and vary directly with, the
wholesaler's cost of carrying inventory in excess of the wholesaler's ordinary course of business inventory level, substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
do not transfer upon shipment and, accordingly, such sales should be accounted for using the consignment model. The determination of when, if at all, sales to a
wholesaler meet the foregoing criteria involves evaluation of a variety of factors and a number of complex judgments. Under the consignment model, the Company
does not recognize revenue upon shipment of product. Rather, upon shipment of product the Company invoices the wholesaler, records deferred revenue at gross
invoice sales price and classifies the inventory held by the wholesalers as consignment inventory at the Company's cost of such inventory. The Company recognizes
revenue when the consignment inventory is no longer subject to incentive arrangements but not later than when such inventory is sold through to the wholesalers'
customers, on a first-in first-out (FIFO) basis.
The Company's estimates of inventory at the wholesalers and deferred revenue on consigned inventory are based on the projected prescription demand-based
sales for its products, as well as the Company's analysis of third-party information, including information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their
inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and the Company's internal information. The Company's estimates are subject to
inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party data, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations.
Revenues are reduced at the time of sale to reflect expected returns that are estimated based on historical experience. Additionally, provision is made at the time
of sale for all discounts, rebates and estimated sales allowances based on historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances, as appropriate. Such
provision is recorded as a reduction of revenue.
52
The Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 01-9 as of January 1, 2002 and now presents the cost of certain vendor considerations (e.g.,
cooperative advertising payments, shelving allowances and manufacturers coupons) as reductions of revenue instead of advertising and promotion expenses.
Financial information for all prior periods presented has been reclassified to comply with the income statement classification requirements of the new guidance. In
2002, $104 million of promotional expenses was recorded as a reduction of net sales. Certain promotional expenses were reclassified primarily from advertising and
promotion expenses to a reduction in net sales in 2001 and 2000, in the amount of $152 million and $157 million, respectively.
Sales Rebate and Return Accruals
Medicaid and managed healthcare sales rebate and return accruals are established in the same period the related revenue is recognized resulting in a reduction to
sales and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued liabilities. An accrual is recorded based on an estimate of the proportion of recorded revenue
that will result in a rebate or return. Prime vendor charge-backs, established in a similar manner, are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable ($126 million and
$159 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively).
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes has been determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes
represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes
represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between the
financial and tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted.
Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The Company does not
record a provision for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which it does not expect to repatriate in the foreseeable future.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents primarily include securities with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase, recorded at cost, which approximates
market value.
Time Deposits and Marketable Securities
Time deposits and marketable securities are available for sale and are recorded at fair value, which approximates cost.
Inventory Valuation
Inventories are generally stated at average cost, not in excess of market.
Capital Assets and Depreciation
Expenditures for additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized at cost. Depreciation is generally computed on a straight-line method based on the
estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of the major classes of depreciable assets are 50 years for buildings and 3 to 40 years for
machinery, equipment and fixtures. The Company periodically evaluates whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable
assets may not be recoverable.53
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. The adoption of SFAS
No. 144 did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. SFAS No. 144 establishes the accounting for impairment of long-lived
tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill and for the disposal of a segment of a business. Pursuant to SFAS No. 144, the Company periodically evaluates
whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances
are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the
carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active
markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of
estimated future cash flows. The Company reports an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value.
Capitalized Software
Certain costs to obtain internal use software for significant systems projects are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, which
ranges from four to ten years. Costs to obtain software for projects that are not significant are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software, net of accumulated
amortization, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $370 million and $333 million, respectively.
Acquisitions
The Company adopted SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, in 2001. SFAS No. 141 requires that companies use the purchase method of accounting for all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001.
Investments
The Company consolidates all majority (more than 50%) owned subsidiaries where it has the ability to exercise control. The Company accounts for 50% or less
owned companies over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence using the equity method of accounting. The Company's share of net income or losses
of equity investments is included in minority interest in the consolidated statement of earnings. The Company periodically reviews these equity investments for
impairment and adjusts these investments to their fair value when a decline in market value is deemed to be other than temporary. During 2002, the Company recorded
an asset impairment charge of $379 million for an other than temporary decline in the market value of ImClone Systems Incorporated (ImClone).
Long-term investments in securities, which comprises marketable equity securities and other securities and investments for which market values are not readily
available, are included in other assets. Marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value. Fair value is based on quoted market
prices as of the end of the reporting period. Other securities and investments for which market values are not readily available are carried at cost. Unrealized gains and
losses are reported, net of their related tax effects, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity until sold. At the time of
sale, any gains or losses calculated by the specific identification method are recognized in other (income)/expense. Losses are also recognized in income when a
decline in market value is deemed to be other than temporary.
54
Goodwill
The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, on January 1, 2002, with certain provisions adopted as of July 1, 2001 with respect
to amortization of goodwill arising from acquisitions made after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets
acquired outside a business combination and the recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. Under the
new rules, goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests. In connection with this accounting change, the goodwill resulting from the
Company's acquisition of the DuPont pharmaceuticals business and investment in ImClone is not amortized.
The goodwill arising from business acquisitions prior to July 1, 2001 was amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 15 to 40 years. This
goodwill is not amortized effective January 1, 2002. In each of 2001 and 2000, goodwill amortization expense was $75 million.
In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill is tested for impairment upon adoption of the new standard and annually thereafter. SFAS No. 142 requires that
goodwill be tested for impairment using a two-step process. The first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the
impairment loss, if any. Goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company has
completed its goodwill impairment assessment which indicated no impairment of goodwill.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets, consisting of patents, technology and licenses, are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 3 to 17 years, representing the
remaining life of the assets. SFAS No. 142 requires that indefinite-lived intangible assets be tested for impairment using a one-step process which consists of a
comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the intangible asset. Intangible assets are deemed to be impaired if the net book value exceeds the estimated fair
value. All other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144 as described above.
Product Liability
Accruals for product liability are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be
reasonably estimated, based on existing information. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessment efforts progress or as additional information becomes
available. Receivables for related insurance or other third-party recoveries for product liabilities are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a
recovery will be realized. Insurance recoverable recorded on the balance sheet has, in general, payment terms of two years or less. Amounts of receivables
recognized, not in excess of related liabilities, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $1 million and $158 million, respectively.
Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that cover a wide
range of matters, including, among others, product liability, environmental liability and tax matters. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies,
the Company records accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. For a
discussion of contingencies, reference is made to Note 8, Income Taxes, and Note 22, Litigation Matters, to these consolidated financial statements.55
Derivative Financial Instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used by the Company principally in the management of its interest rate and foreign currency exposures. The Company does
not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The Company records all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in a derivative's fair value are recognized in earnings unless specific
hedge criteria are met. If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the
hedged risk are recognized as a charge or credit to earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of
the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings when the hedged item affects earnings
and the cash flows are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. For purchased foreign currency options the entire change in fair value is included in the
measurement of hedge effectiveness for cash flow hedges. Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized as a charge or credit to
earnings.
The Company designates and assigns derivatives as hedges of forecasted transactions, specific assets or specific liabilities. When hedged assets or liabilities
are sold or extinguished or the forecasted transactions being hedged are no longer expected to occur, the Company recognizes the gain or loss on the designated
hedging financial instruments.
Shipping and Handling Costs
The Company typically does not charge customers for shipping and handling costs. Shipping and handling costs are included in marketing, selling and
administrative expenses and for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $248 million, $258 million and $262 million, respectively.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $393 million, $401 million and $483 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Acquired In-Process Research and Development
The fair value of in-process research and development acquired in a business combination is determined by independent appraisal and based on the present
value of each research project's projected cash flows, utilizing an income approach consistent with the AICPA Practice Aid, Assets Acquired in Business
Combinations to be Used in Research and Development Activities: A Focus in Software, Electronic Devices and Pharmaceutical Industries. Future cash flows are
predominately based on the net income forecast of each project consistent with historical pricing, margins and expense levels of similar products. Revenues are
estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors, expected industry trends, individual project life cycles and the life of each research project's underlying
patent. In determining the fair value of each research project, expected revenues are first adjusted for technical risk of completion. The resulting cash flows are then
discounted at a rate approximating the Company's weighted average cost of capital, 13% in 2001. Other acquired in-process research and development is expensed as
incurred when the underlying product has not received regulatory approval and does not have any future alternative use. In addition, costs that are nonrefundable,
related to the acquisition or licensing of products that have not yet received regulatory approval to be marketed and that have no alternative future use are charged
to earnings as incurred.
56
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per common share are computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share
are computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year plus the incremental shares outstanding assuming the exercise of dilutive
stock options.
Stock Compensation Plans
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting
for its stock-based compensation plans. The Company does not recognize compensation expense for stock options granted under the plans as the exercise price of
the option on the date of grant is equal to the fair market value as of that date. For grants of restricted stock, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a
straight-line basis over the period that the restrictions expire.
The following table summarizes the Company's results on a pro forma basis as if it had recorded compensation expense based upon the fair value at the grant
date for awards under these plans consistent with the methodology prescribed under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, for 2002, 2001 and
2000:
(dollars in millions, except per share data) 2002 2001 2000
Net Earnings:
As reported $ 2,066 $ 4,834 $ 4,471

See Note 16, Stockholders' Equity, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent
disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the methodused on reported results. The provisions of SFAS No. 148 are effective for financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 148 did not have a
material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, as the adoption of this standard does not require the Company to change, and the Company
does not plan to change, to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based compensation.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
57
Accounting Policies to be Implemented
Variable Interest Entities
In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). FIN 46 requires a variable interest entity to be
consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity's activities or entitled to receive a majority of the
entity's residual returns or both. FIN 46 also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a
significant variable interest. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to existing
entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after
January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The Company is in the process of assessing what impact this pronouncement will
have on its consolidated financial statements. Based on its preliminary analysis of the impact of FIN 46, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that
ImClone could meet the criteria to be considered a variable interest entity in relation to the Company. Accordingly, the Company included the required transitional
disclosures of FIN 46 in Note 2, Alliances and Investments, to these consolidated financial statements.
Guarantees
In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize a liability at the inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the obligation
undertaken in issuing the guarantee and include more detailed disclosure with respect to guarantees. The types of contracts the Company enters into that meet the
scope of this interpretation are financial and performance standby letters of credit on behalf of wholly-owned subsidiaries. FIN 45 is effective for guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002. The initial adoption of this accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated
financial statements.
Note 2 ALLIANCES AND INVESTMENTS
Sanofi-Synthelabo
In 1997, the Company entered into a codevelopment and comarketing agreement with Sanofi-Synthelabo (Sanofi) for two products: AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*
(irbesartan), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of hypertension, and PLAVIX* (clopidogrel), a platelet inhibitor. The worldwide alliance
operates under the framework of two geographic territories; one in the Americas and Australia and the other in Europe and Asia. Two territory partnerships were
formed to manage central expenses, such as marketing, research and development and royalties, and to supply finished product to the individual countries. At the
country level, agreements either to copromote (whereby a partnership was formed between the parties to sell each brand) or to comarket (whereby the parties operate
and sell their brands independently of each other) are in place.
The Company acts as the operating partner for the territory covering the Americas (principally the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico and Latin American countries) and
Australia and owns the majority controlling interest in this territory. As such, the Company consolidates all country partnership results for this territory and records
Sanofi's share of the results as a minority interest expense, net of taxes, which was $258 million in 2002, $158 million in 2001 and $128 million in 2000. The Company
recorded sales in this territory and in comarketing countries of $2,476 million in 2002, $1,658 million in 2001 and $1,249 million in 2000.
58
Sanofi acts as the operating partner of the territory covering Europe and Asia and owns the majority controlling interest in this territory. The Company accounts
for the investment in partnership entities in this territory under the equity method and records its share of the results as net income from unconsolidated affiliates
(included in minority interest, net of taxes). The Company's share of net income from these partnership entities was $87 million in 2002, $51 million in 2001, and
$36 million in 2000.
In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company and Sanofi modified their codevelopment arrangement for irbesartan to form an alliance, as part of which the Company
contributed the irbesartan intellectual property and Sanofi agreed to pay the Company $200 million and $150 million in the fourth quarters of 2001 and 2002,
respectively. The Company accounts for this transaction as a sale of an interest in a license and defers and amortizes the $350 million into income over the expected
useful life of the license, which is approximately eleven years. The Company amortized into income $31 million and $8 million, respectively, in 2002 and 2001.
Otsuka
In 1999, the Company entered into a worldwide commercialization agreement with Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka), to codevelop and copromote
ABILIFY* (aripiprazole) for the treatment of schizophrenia. Total milestone payments made to Otsuka from 1999 through December 2002 were $207 million, of which
$157 million was expensed as acquired in-process research and development in 1999. Of the remaining $50 million that was capitalized, $30 million was refundable if
ABILIFY* was not granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and $20 million was paid upon FDA approval of the product in
November 2002. The $50 million of capitalized payments are being amortized over the remaining patent life of the product, which is approximately 10 years. The
Company began copromoting the product with Otsuka in the U.S. and Puerto Rico in November 2002. Revenue is earned when Otsuka ships the product and title
passes to the customer. The Company records alliance revenue for its 65% share of the net sales in these copromotion countries and records all expenses related to
the product. Introductory sales in these copromotion countries were $25 million in 2002.
ImClone
In November 2001, the Company purchased 14.4 million shares of ImClone for $70 per share, or $1,007 million, which represented approximately 19.9% of the
ImClone shares outstanding just prior to the Company's commencement of a public tender offer for ImClone shares. This transaction is being accounted for using the
equity method of accounting. ImClone is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing targeted cancer treatments, which include growth factor blockers,
cancer vaccines, and anti-angiogenesis therapeutics. The equity investment in ImClone is part of a strategic agreement between the Company and ImClone that also
included an arrangement to codevelop and copromote an investigational cancer drug, ERBITUX*, for a series of payments originally totaling $1 billion. The Companypaid ImClone a milestone payment of $200 million in 2001.
On March 5, 2002, the agreement with ImClone was revised to reduce the total payments to $900 million from $1 billion. Under the revised agreement, the
Company paid ImClone $140 million in March 2002 and $60 million in March 2003 and will pay an aggregate of $500 million upon achievement of two milestones. Of
the $200 million paid to ImClone in March 2002 and 2003, $160 million was expensed to in-process research and development in the first quarter of 2002. The remaining
$40 million was recorded as an additional equity investment to eliminate the income statement effect of the portion of the milestone payment for which the Company
has an economic claim through its 19.9% ownership interest in ImClone. Also under the revised agreement, the
59
Company will pay ImClone a distribution fee based on a flat rate of 39% of product revenues in North America. The terms of the revised agreement will continue
through 2018.
In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $735 million, comprised of $575 million for the write-off of acquired in-
process research and development related to the equity investment and $160 million for the write-off of a portion of the $200 million milestone payment made in 2001.
The remaining $40 million of the $200 million milestone payment was recorded as an additional equity investment to eliminate the income statement effect of the
portion of the milestone payment for which the Company has an economic claim through its 19.9% ownership interest in ImClone. The acquired in-process research
and development charge related to three oncology research projects in the Phase I or later stage of development with one research project, ERBITUX*, in late Phase
III development. The amount was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility has not been established and for which
there is no alternative future use. The projected FDA approval dates used were years 2002 through 2008, at which time the Company expected these projects to begin
to generate cash flows. The cost to complete these projects was estimated at $323 million. All of the research and development projects considered in the valuation
are subject to the normal risks and uncertainties associated with demonstrating the safety and efficacy required to obtain FDA approval. The purchase price
allocation resulted in $66 million of patent and technology intangible assets which are being amortized over their weighted-average useful lives of 17 years and
approximately $375 million of goodwill, which is not amortized.
On December 28, 2001, ImClone announced that the FDA refused to accept for filing the Biologics License Application (BLA) that had been submitted by
ImClone for ERBITUX*. The BLA had been submitted to gain marketing approval to treat irinotecan-refractory colorectal carcinoma.
On January 18, 2002, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced that it is investigating
questions about the conduct of ImClone in the development of ERBITUX*. On January 25, 2002, ImClone announced it had received an informal inquiry from the
Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as inquiries from the Department of Justice and the aforementioned subcommittee. The Company is cooperating with
these investigations.
Of the $1,207 million paid in 2001 for the equity investment ($1,007 million) and the milestone payment ($200 million), $735 million was expensed as acquired in-
process research and development in 2001 and the remaining $472 million was recorded as an equity investment. An additional $9 million was recorded to the
investment primarily for acquisition costs, resulting in a carrying value of $481 million at December 31, 2001. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company recorded a pre-
tax charge to earnings of $379 million for an other than temporary decline in the market value of ImClone based on the decline in value of ImClone's shares during
2002. The fair value of the equity investment in ImClone used to record the impairment was determined based on the market value of ImClone shares on September 30,
2002. The total equity investment in ImClone as of December 31, 2002 was $102 million. On a per share basis, the carrying value of the ImClone investment and the
closing market price of ImClone shares as of December 31, 2002 were $7.09 and $10.62, respectively, compared to $33.40 and $46.46, respectively, as of December 31,
2001. The closing market price of ImClone shares as of February 28, 2003 was $13.33 per share.
In 2002, the Company recorded a $23 million net loss for its share of ImClone's losses.
The Company is in the process of assessing what impact FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, could have on its consolidated financial
statements. Based on its preliminary assessment of the impact of FIN 46, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that ImClone could be considered a
variable interest entity in relation to the Company. As of September 30, 2002, ImClone had total assets of $501 million, a total stockholders' deficit of $118 million, and
an accumulated deficit of $461 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, ImClone had a $115 million net loss.

Note 3 RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS
2002 Activities
During 2002, the Company recorded pretax restructuring and other charges of $160 million, relating to a reduction or elimination of non-strategic research efforts
as well as the consolidation of research facilities, workforce reductions and downsizing and streamlining of worldwide operations. Of this charge, $71 million relates to
employee termination benefits for approximately 1,040 employees, including research, manufacturing and administrative personnel. Of the remaining $89 million,
$65 million represents asset write downs and other exit costs for the closure of facilities and other related expenses and $24 million is an impairment charge for the
Company's investment in Deltagen. In addition, $69 million of accelerated depreciation relating to the planned shutdown of research facilities in the U.S. has been
included in research and development expense, and $2 million for inventory write-offs associated with these projects has been included in cost of products sold.
These charges were offset by an adjustment to prior period restructuring reserves of $146 million, $65 million of which is due to lower than expected separation costs,
$59 million due to higher than anticipated proceeds from disposal of assets previously written off as restructuring and $22 million for projects that have been
cancelled. In addition, a $17 million adjustment to cost of products sold was made to reflect the reversal of inventory reserves associated with cancelled projects. The
Company expects to substantially complete these restructuring activities by late 2003.
The following table presents a detail of the charges by operating segment and type. The Company does not allocate restructuring charges to its business
segments.

2001 Activities
During 2001, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring and other charges of $569 million. The restructuring programs included termination benefits, asset
write-downs and other costs and were implemented in 2001 to downsize and streamline operations, rationalize manufacturing facilities, and terminate certain sales
force and research contract obligations. At the time recorded, these actions were expected to be completed within twelve months and are now expected to be
substantially complete in early 2003. Additional costs associated with restructuring projects in 2001 include $74 million of sales deductions and customer charge
backs relating to abandonment of non-strategic pharmaceutical product lines, which has been included as a reduction in sales, and $58 million of related inventory
write-offs, which has been included in cost of products sold. Restructuring charges were offset by a
62
reversal of $63 million as a result of a change in estimate relating to separation costs or cancellation of projects previously provided for.
The 2001 charge consisted of $229 million for employee termination benefits for 3,400 employees. Severance actions were the result of a Company-wide
restructuring effort to downsize and streamline operations and impacted virtually all areas including sales force, manufacturing, administrative and research
personnel. In addition, $95 million was accrued for the termination of a contract sales force, and $65 million was accrued for other exit costs, primarily related to costs
associated with the closure of certain manufacturing operations.
The charge also included $104 million of fixed asset write-downs and $15 million of other asset write-downs primarily related to the exit of a Nutritionals business
in Eastern Europe, the closure of a pharmaceutical production facility in the U.S. and the closure of a research facility in France.

future breast implant claims and $11 million for costs associated with a product recall.
2000 Activities
During 2000, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring and other charges of $443 million. The restructuring programs, which included termination benefits,
asset write-downs and other costs, were implemented in 2000 to consolidate the U.S. sales force, rationalize manufacturing facilities and downsize and streamline
operations. Additional costs associated with restructuring projects, in the year 2000, include $40 million of related inventory write-offs, which has been included in
cost of products sold. These actions are substantially complete.
The 2000 charge consisted of $291 million of employee termination benefits for approximately 5,200 employees. Severance actions were focused on sales force,
manufacturing and administrative personnel. In addition, $24 million of other costs were recorded, consisting mainly of certain contract termination and facility
remediation expenses.
63
The charge also included $79 million of asset write-downs primarily related to the exit of a research facility in Japan, manufacturing operations in the U.S. and
certain international operations of ConvaTec. In addition, other assets of $10 million were written off, which consisted primarily of capitalized software no longer used
as a result of sales force actions described above.

Note 4 ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
DuPont Pharmaceuticals AcquisitionOn October 1, 2001, the Company acquired the DuPont Pharmaceuticals business (DuPont) from E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company for $7.8 billion in cash.
The results of DuPont have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. DuPont is primarily a domestic pharmaceutical and
imaging product business focused on research and development. This acquisition was financed with proceeds from the issuance of $1.5 billion of commercial paper,
the issuance of $5.0 billion of medium-term notes and internal cash flows.
Following is a summary of the final allocation of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (dollars in millions):
Current assets $ 520
Property, plant and equipment 321
Intangible assets 1,976
Acquired in-process research and development 2,009
Goodwill 3,780
Other assets 280
Total assets acquired 8,886
Current liabilities 353
Restructuring liabilities 575
Acquisition liabilities 90
Long term liabilities 123
Total liabilities assumed 1,141
Purchase Price $ 7,745
The total intangible assets of $1,976 million are being amortized over their weighted-average useful lives and include core and developed technology of
$1,783 million (15 and 11 years weighted-average useful life, respectively) and patents of $193 million (11 year weighted-average useful life).
The goodwill of $3,780 million was assigned to the Pharmaceuticals segment. Of that total amount, $2,418 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes
over a 15 year period.
At the time of acquisition, $2.0 billion of the purchase price was allocated to acquired in-process research and development and was charged to earnings in the
fourth quarter of 2001. This charge was associated with five research projects in the Cardiovascular, Central Nervous System, Oncology and Anti-Infective
therapeutic areas ranging from the preclinical to the phase II development stage. The amount was determined by identifying research projects for which technological
feasibility has not been established and for which there is no alternative future use. The projected FDA approval dates were years 2005 through 2008, at which time
the Company expected these projects to begin to generate cash flows. The cost to complete these research projects was estimated at $1.2 billion. All of the research
and development projects considered in the valuation are subject to the normal risks and uncertainties associated with demonstrating the safety and efficacy required
to obtain FDA approval. In 2002, the Company terminated one of the projects in the Anti-Infective therapeutic area. The termination of this project is not expected to
have a material impact on the Company's future earnings and cash flow. The
65
remaining four projects are currently proceeding consistent with the original assumptions used in their valuation. All of the research and development projects
considered in the valuation are subject to the normal risks and uncertainties associated with demonstrating the safety and efficiency required for FDA approval.
In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded $575 million of restructuring liabilities as a result of severance and relocation of workforce, the
elimination of duplicate facilities and contract terminations. Such costs have been recognized by the Company as a liability assumed as of the acquisition date,
resulting in additional goodwill. These liabilities consisted of $325 million of employee termination benefits for approximately 1,800 employees, $80 million related to
the closure of facilities, and $170 million for contract terminations. The $575 million originally recorded in accrued expenses was reduced to $458 million by
December 31, 2001 and to $13 million by December 31, 2002. The reduction of the balance during 2002 was due to cash payments of $284 million and an adjustment to
reverse previously recorded liabilities of $161 million, with a corresponding reduction in goodwill. The adjustment was primarily due to lower than expected separation
costs, contract termination expenses and other facilities exit costs related to the acquisition.
The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents results as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the respective periods:
Year Ended December 31,
2001 2000
(dollars in millions, except per share data)
Net Sales $ 19,248 $ 18,997
Net Earnings 5,740 4,063
Earnings Per Share—Basic 2.96 2.07
Earnings Per Share—Diluted 2.92 2.03
The unaudited pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and include certain adjustments such as additional amortization expense as a
result of identifiable intangible assets arising from the acquisition and from increased interest expense on acquisition debt, and exclude the acquired in-process
research and development charge related to the DuPont acquisition. Pro forma net earnings and earnings per share amounts for 2001 include a $2.6 billion gain on the
sale of Clairol. The pro forma results are not necessarily indicative either of the results of operations that actually would have resulted had the acquisition been in
effect at the beginning of the respective periods or of future results.
Other
In 2002, the Company completed the sale of two branded products, MOISTUREL* and DURICEF*, which resulted in a pretax gain of $30 million.In 2001, the Company completed the sale of three pharmaceutical products, CORZIDE*, DELESTROGEN* and FLORINEF*, the licensing rights to CORGARD* in
the U.S., ESTRACE* tablets, the Apothecon commodity business, and its SOLAGE* and VIACTIV* product lines, all of which resulted in a pretax gain of
$475 million.
66
In 2000, the Company completed the sale of three pharmaceutical products, ESTRACE* Cream, OVCON* 35 and OVCON* 50, as well as its SEA BREEZE* brand
in Japan, resulting in a pretax gain of $216 million.
Note 5 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In 2001, the Company completed the sale of Clairol to Procter & Gamble for cash proceeds of approximately $5.0 billion. The sale resulted in a pretax gain of
$4.3 billion ($2.6 billion after taxes), which is included in the gain on disposal of discontinued operations. In addition, in 2001, the Company spun off Zimmer
Holdings, Inc., in a tax-free distribution, resulting in a common stock dividend of $156 million. In 2002, the Company resolved several post-closing matters associated
with previously discontinued businesses, resulting in an increase of $38 million to gain on disposal. In 2002, the Company recorded a $4 million credit to retained
earnings related to an adjustment for a Zimmer pension liability affecting the spin-off of Zimmer.
In 2000, the Company completed the sale of Matrix to Cosmair, Inc., a wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of L'Oreal S.A., resulting in a pretax gain of $444 million
($266 million after taxes). The gain is included in the gain on disposal of discontinued operations.
The net sales and earnings of discontinued operations are as follows:
2001 2000
(dollars in millions)
Net sales $ 2,152 $ 2,911
Earnings before income taxes(1) $ 451 $ 606
Income taxes 225 231
Net earnings from discontinued operations $ 226 $ 375
(1) Earnings before income taxes for 2000 include restructuring charges of $34 million.
The net loss of $6 million in 2002 reflected in the statement of earnings reflects the settlement of litigation related to a business included in discontinued
operations.
The consolidated statement of cash flows includes the Clairol and Zimmer businesses through date of disposition. The net assets of discontinued operations at
December 31, 2000 were $924 million, consisting of current assets of $866 million and long-term assets of $616 million less liabilities (principally current) of
$558 million. The Company uses a centralized approach to the cash management and financing of its operations and accordingly, the Company does not allocate debt
to these businesses.
Cash flows from operating and investing activities (principally investing) of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were
$(17) million, $5.3 billion (including approximately $5.0 billion of proceeds from the sale of Clairol), and $998 million (including $438 million of proceeds from the sale of
Matrix), respectively.

69
The Company's provision for income taxes in 2002, 2001 and 2000 was different from the amount computed by applying the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate
to earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes, as a result of the following:

$ 435 16.4% $ 73 3.3% $ 1,320 25.2%
The effective tax rate on continuing operations increased to 16.4% in 2002 from 3.3% in 2001 due primarily to the decrease in the effective tax rate benefit from
operations in Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland to (18.7%) in 2002 from (32.7%) in 2001 reflecting a lesser percentage of the total pre-tax income generated in these
jurisdictions in 2002, as well as the current year U.S. tax cost associated with a dividend from Switzerland.
Prepaid taxes at December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $927 million and $1,524 million, respectively. The deferred income taxes included in other assets at
December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $942 million and $630 million, respectively.

$ 1,869 $ 2,154
The decrease in the net prepaid and deferred tax assets to $1,869 at December 31, 2002 from $2,154 at December 31, 2001 relates primarily to consignment andother inventory items as well as restructuring, acquisition and divestiture reserve reductions.
The valuation allowance of $192 million at December 31, 2002 relates to $112 million of state net deferred tax assets, $45 million of state net operating loss
carryforwards, and $35 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards that the Company does not currently believe are more likely than not to be realized in the future.
Income taxes paid during the year were $2,491 million, $1,021 million and $1,620 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The current tax benefit realized upon the exercise of stock options is charged to capital in excess of par and amounted to $45 million, $157 million and $184 million
in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The Company has settled its U.S. Federal income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service through 1997.
U.S. federal income taxes have not been provided on substantially all of the unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, since it is management's practice and
intent to indefinitely postpone their remittance. The total amount of the net unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries was approximately $9.0 billion at
December 31, 2002.
Certain tax contingencies exist and when probable and reasonably estimable, amounts are recognized. As of December 31, 2002, there are certain tax
contingencies that either are not considered probable or are not reasonably estimable by the Company at this time. Although the Company cannot reasonably
estimate the possible amount of any such contingency, it is possible that such contingencies could be material. The effect of changes in estimates related to
contingent tax matters is included in
71
the rate reconciliation above. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $235 million due to the settlement of certain
prior year tax matters and the determination by the Company as to the expected settlement of ongoing tax litigation.
Also in 2002, the Company reorganized the structure of its ownership of many of its non-U.S. subsidiaries. The principal purpose of the reorganization was to
facilitate the Company's ability to efficiently deploy its financial resources outside the U.S. The Company believes that the reorganization transactions were generally
tax-free both inside and outside the U.S. It is possible, however, that taxing authorities in particular jurisdictions could assert tax liabilities arising from the
reorganization transactions or the operations of the reorganized subsidiaries. It is not reasonably possible to predict whether any taxing authority will assert such a
tax liability or to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to any such asserted tax liability. The Company would vigorously challenge any
such assertion and believes that it would prevail but there can be no assurance of such a result. If the Company were not to prevail in final, non-appealable
determinations, it is possible the impact could be material.

Note 11 CONSIGNMENT
A significant portion of the Company's U.S. pharmaceuticals sales is made to wholesalers. The Company experienced a substantial buildup of wholesalerinventories in its U.S. pharmaceuticals business over several years, primarily in 2000 and 2001. This buildup was primarily due to sales incentives offered by the
Company to its wholesalers. The Company accounts for certain sales of pharmaceutical products to Cardinal Health, Inc. (Cardinal) and McKesson Corporation
(McKesson) using the consignment model, based in part on the relationship between the amount of incentives offered to these wholesales and the amount of
inventory held by these wholesalers.
The Company determined that shipments of product to Cardinal and shipments of product to McKesson met the consignment model criteria set forth under
Revenue Recognition in Note 1, Accounting Policies, to these consolidated financial statements as of July 1, 1999 and July 1, 2000, respectively, and, in each case,
continuing through the end of 2002 and for some period thereafter. Accordingly, the consignment model is required to be applied to such shipments. Prior to those
respective periods, the Company recognized revenue with respect to sales to Cardinal and McKesson upon shipment of product. Although the Company generally
views approximately one month of supply as a desirable level of wholesaler inventory on a going-forward basis and as a level of wholesaler inventory representative
of an industry average, in applying the consignment model to sales to Cardinal and McKesson, the Company defined inventory in excess of the wholesaler's ordinary
course of business inventory level as inventory above two weeks and three weeks of supply, respectively, based on the levels of inventory that Cardinal and
McKesson required to be used as the basis for negotiation of incentives granted.
In March 2001, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with McKesson for provision of warehousing and order fulfillment services for the Company's
Oncology Therapeutics Network (OTN), a specialty distributor of anti-cancer medicines and related products. Under the terms of the agreement, McKesson
purchases oncology products to service OTN's fulfillment needs from a number of vendors, including the Company. Subsequent to shipment of product to
McKesson, the Company has a significant continuing involvement in the transaction, including marketing the product to the end-user, invoicing the customer and
collecting receivables from the customer on behalf of McKesson. In addition, OTN keeps all the credit risk and is responsible for shipping costs to the customer. The
Company accounts for these sales using the consignment model and defers recognition of revenue until the products are sold by McKesson.
These transactions resulted in deferred revenue of $470 million and $2,026 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company recognized
approximately $1,395 million of previously recorded deferred revenue as net sales in 2002. The Company projects approximately $422 million of deferred revenue to be
recognized as net sales in 2003, a significant portion of which is expected to be recognized in the first quarter of 2003.

Note 15 SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LONG-TERM DEBT
Included in short-term borrowings were amounts due to foreign banks of $89 million and $140 million, and current installments of long-term debt of $132 million
and $34 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. U.S. commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2002 was $1,158 million, with an average interest rate
of 1.40%. There was no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2001. The proceeds from the commercial paper issuances in 2002 were used for general
corporate purposes. The average interest rate on short-term borrowings was 9.58% and 7.41%, and 2.77% and 4.03% on current installments of long-term debt at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
During 2001, the Company consolidated two credit facilities, aggregating $500 million with a syndicate of lenders as support for its commercial paper program.
The credit facility consists of a $500 million, five-year revolving credit facility, extendable at each anniversary date with the consent of the lenders. There were no
borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at December 31, 2002. The Company had unused short-term lines of credit with foreign banks of $392 million at
December 31, 2002.

During 2001, the Company issued $5.0 billion of debt notes, of which $2.5 billion matures in 2006 and the remaining $2.5 billion matures in 2011. The Company has
the option to redeem, at any time, all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of: (1) the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus
accrued interest to the redemption date, and (2) a premium over face value paid to redeem the notes. The effective interest rates for these series of notes are 5.26%
and 6.05%, respectively. The effective interest rates for all other issuances approximated the stated interest rate. The Company has entered into fixed to floating
interest rate swaps for $3.0 billion of its long-term debt. Cash payments for interest were $375 million, $100 million and $112 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000,respectively.

As a result of the previously disclosed restatement of previously issued financial statements, the Company delayed filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
the quarterly period ended September 30, 2002 (third quarter 2002 Form 10-Q). As previously disclosed, this delay resulted in a breach by the Company of delivery of
SEC filing obligations under the 1993 Indenture (Indenture) between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank), under which
the Company has approximately $6.1 billion of long-term debt outstanding, and certain other credit agreements, and gave certain rights to the trustee under the
Indenture and the respective lenders under such credit agreements to accelerate maturity of the Company's indebtedness. Neither the trustee nor the respective
lenders exercised their right to accelerate. The Company has filed the third quarter 2002 Form 10-Q with the SEC and cured the noncompliance with the
abovementioned obligations in the Indenture and these other credit agreements. Accordingly, the debt outstanding under the Indenture and these other credit
agreements no longer can be accelerated and, therefore, has been classified as long-term debt on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.
76
At December 31, 2002, the Company had provided financial guarantees in the form of stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds. The majority of the
stand-by letters of credit are with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Massachusetts Department of Public Health relating to the Company's Medical
Imaging manufacturing operations and with insurance companies in support of third party liability programs. The performance bonds relate to the sale of Company
product to various foreign ministries of health in the Middle East. The Company believes the significant majority of these guarantees will expire without being
funded. The amounts of these obligations are presented in the following table:

Stock Compensation Plans
Under the Company's 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, officers, directors and key employees may be granted options to purchase the Company's common stock at no
less than 100% of the market price on the date the option is granted. Options generally become exercisable in installments of 25% per year on each of the first through
the fourth anniversaries of the grant date and have a maximum term of 10 years. Additionally, the plan provides for the granting of stock appreciation rights whereby
the grantee may surrender exercisable rights and receive common stock and/or cash measured by the excess of the market price of the common stock over the option
exercise price. The plan also provides for the granting of performance-based stock options to certain key executives.
Under the terms of the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, authorized shares include 0.9% of the outstanding shares per year through 2007, as well as the number of
shares tendered in a prior year to pay the purchase price of options and the number of shares previously utilized to satisfy withholding tax obligations upon exercise.
Shares which were available for grant in a prior year but were not granted in such year and shares which were cancelled, forfeited or expired are also available for
future grant. The plan incorporates the Company's long-term performance awards.
In addition, the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the granting of up to 20,000,000 shares of common stock to key employees, subject to restrictions as to
continuous employment. Restrictions generally expire over a five-year period from date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized over the restricted period. At
December 31, 2002 and 2001, there were 1,705,503 and 1,286,771 restricted shares outstanding under the plan, respectively.
Under the TeamShare Stock Option Plan, all full-time employees, excluding key executives, are granted options to purchase the Company's common stock at the
market price on the date the options are granted. The Company has authorized 66,000,000 shares for issuance under the plan. Individual grants generally become
exercisable evenly on the third, fourth, and fifth anniversary of the grant date and have a maximum term of 10 years. As of December 31, 2002, 31,334,729 shares have
been exercised under the plan.
78
The fair value of the options granted during 2002, 2001 and 2000 was estimated as $11.12 per common share, $22.59 per common share and $17.17 per common
share, respectively, on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

preserve the intrinsic value of the stock options and the ratio of exercise price to fair value that existed prior to the spin-off.

Note 17 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company is exposed to market risk due to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. As a result, the Company utilizes foreign exchange option
and forward contracts to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on anticipated foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany inventory purchases
expected to occur within the next year.
The Company had exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, which approximated $2,093 million and $2,079 million at December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively, primarily in Europe, Japan, Mexico and Canada. The Company mitigates the effect of these exposures through third-party borrowings.
The exposures to net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations and included in the above amounts are not material.
Foreign exchange option contracts and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated transactions. The Company's primary foreign currency exposures in
relation to the U.S. dollar are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Mexican peso. The notional amounts of the Company's foreign exchange derivative
contracts at December 31, 2002 and 2001, were $1,775 million and $1,387 million, respectively. For these derivatives, which qualify as hedges of future cash flows, the
effective portion of changes in fair value is temporarily recorded in comprehensive income and then recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings.
Any ineffective portion of hedges is reported in earnings as it occurs. The notional amounts of foreign exchange derivative contracts related to discontinued
operations and included in the above amounts are not material. The fair value of option and forward contracts, which is recorded in prepaid expenses, at December 31,
2002 and 2001 was $41 million and $27 million, respectively. The fair values of the Company's derivative instruments are based on relevant market information
including current forward currency exchange rates and current interest rates. The fair value of option contracts is estimated by using the Black-Scholes model and is
based on year-end currency rates. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is based on year-end forward currency rates.
The Company uses derivative instruments as part of its interest rate risk management policy. The derivative instruments used include fixed to floating rate
interest rate swaps, which are subject to fair-value hedge accounting treatment. During 2002, the Company entered into several fixed to floating interest rate swapcontracts with five financial institutions. The notional amount of these transactions was $3.0 billion. For the period ended December 31, 2002, in accordance with
SFAS No. 133, the Company recognized a reduction of interest expense of $23 million that reflects the benefit of the lower floating rate obtained in the swap as
compared to the fixed rate of the underlying debt. The swap contracts as well as the underlying debt being hedged are recorded at fair value, which resulted in an
81
increase in current assets and long-term debt of $133 million. Swap contracts are generally held to maturity and the Company does not use derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
In 2001, the Company entered into interest rate hedge contracts, with a notional amount of $2.0 billion, to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates for
long-term fixed-rate debt issues in connection with the DuPont and ImClone transactions (see Note 2, Alliances and Investments, and Note 4, Acquisitions and
Divestitures, to these consolidated financial statements). The contracts were designated as hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in the long-
term benchmark interest rates. Also, in 2001, the Company settled all existing interest rate hedge contracts, and recorded the contract settlements at fair value,
resulting in a $69 million deferred loss, net of taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is being recognized as a yield adjustment over the terms of the
related borrowings.
The carrying amount of the Company's other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts
payable, approximates their fair value at December 31, 2002 and 2001. For long-term debt (other than noted above) the difference between the fair value and carrying
value is not material.
Note 18 SEGMENT INFORMATION
Effective in the first quarter of 2002, the Company reorganized into three groups in support of being a pharmaceutical company with related healthcare
businesses. As a result of this reorganization, there are three reportable segments—Pharmaceuticals, Nutritionals and Other Healthcare. The Pharmaceuticals
segment is comprised of the global pharmaceutical and international (excluding Japan) consumer medicines businesses. The Nutritionals segment consists of Mead
Johnson Nutritionals, primarily an infant formula business. The Other Healthcare segment consists of the ConvaTec, Medical Imaging, and Consumer Medicines
(U.S. and Japan) businesses.
The Company's products are sold principally to the wholesale and retail trade both nationally and internationally. Certain products are also sold to other drug
manufacturers, hospitals and the medical profession. Three wholesalers each accounted for approximately 14% of the Company's net sales in 2002 and 2001. In 2000,
two wholesalers accounted for 12% and 10%, respectively, of the Company's net sales. These sales were concentrated in the Pharmaceuticals segment.

Note 20 RETIREMENT PLANS
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for regular full-time employees. The principal
pension plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Retirement Income Plan. The funding policy is to contribute amounts to provide for current service and to fund past service
liability. Plan benefits are based primarily on years of credited service and on the participant's compensation. Plan assets consist principally of equity and fixed-
income securities.
During 2001, the Company had a domestic curtailment/settlement loss of approximately $25 million resulting from reductions in employment levels primarily in
connection with restructuring activities and the Clairol divestiture.
Cost of the Company's defined benefit plans included the following components:
2002 2001 2000
(dollars in millions)
Service cost — benefits earned during the year $ 158 $ 152 $ 159

Net amount recognized $ 940 $ 352 $ 208
The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in
excess of plan assets were $669 million, $577 million and $289 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2002, $665 million, $562 million and $306 million, respectively, as
of December 31, 2001 and $332 million, $254 million and $47 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2000. This is attributable primarily to a U.S unfunded benefit
equalization plan, several plans in international markets and, at December 31, 2001, a DuPont Pharmaceuticals Company U.S. pension plan.
At December 31, 2002, the unrecognized net actuarial loss, determined based on the market related value of plan assets, was $971 million. This amount exceeded
10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets by $565 million. Unless offset by future unrecognized gains from
higher discount rates or higher than expected returns on plan assets, amortization of this $565 million unrecognized loss is expected to increase pension expense for
2003 and each of the following nine years by approximately $57 million per year.
Several plans had underfunded accrued benefit obligations that exceeded their accrued benefit liabilities at December 31, 2002. Additional minimum liabilities
were established to increase the
86
accrued benefit liabilities to the values of the underfunded accrued benefit obligations. This totaled $138 million for a U.S. unfunded benefit equalization plan and for
the plans in the U.K., Japan, Canada and Belgium. The additional minimum liability was offset by the creation of a $10 million intangible asset and $128 million charge
in other comprehensive income included in stockholders' equity.
The recent decline in the global equity markets has resulted in a decrease in the value of the assets in the Company's pension plans. This decline is expected to
adversely affect the Company's related accounting results in future periods through higher pension expense and increased cash funding requirements. In 2002, the
Company contributed to its defined benefit plans a total of $547 million, including a contribution of $325 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.
The Company reduced its assumed discount rate for the major pension plans in response to a decline in corporate bond yields. The Company also reduced the
2003 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets from 10% to 9% following a reassessment of the long-term outlook. In addition, the Company revised,
based on a change in its expectations of future terminations and retirements, its retirement and turnover assumptions. The pension expense for the Company's
defined benefit pension plans is expected to increase in 2003 by approximately $120 million compared to 2002, reflecting, among other things, lower assumed discount
rate and expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets and negative asset returns in 2001 and 2002.
The principal defined contribution plan is the Bristol-Myers Squibb Savings and Investment Program. The Company's contribution is based on employee
contributions and the level of Company match. The Company's contributions to the plan were $50 million in 2002, $54 million in 2001 and $53 million in 2000.
Note 21 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
The Company provides comprehensive medical and group life benefits for substantially all U.S. retirees who elect to participate in its comprehensive medical and
group life plans. The medical plan is contributory. Contributions are adjusted periodically and vary by date of retirement and the original retiring Company. The life
insurance plan is noncontributory. Plan assets consist principally of equity securities and fixed-income securities.
Cost of the Company's postretirement benefit plans included the following components:
(dollars in millions) 2002 2001 2000
Service cost—benefits earned during the year $ 9 $ 10 $ 9

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 22 LITIGATION MATTERS
Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings are pending against the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for
Contingencies, the Company records accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably
estimated. In the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company recognized $669 million (includes $10 million for discontinued operations) and $77 million,
respectively, related to litigation matters. The most significant of the Company's litigation matters are described below.
TAXOL® LITIGATION
In 1997 and 1998, the Company filed several lawsuits asserting that a number of generic drug companies infringed its patents covering methods of administering
paclitaxel when they filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications seeking regulatory approval to sell paclitaxel. These actions were consolidated for discovery in the
U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (District Court). The Company did not assert a monetary claim against any of the defendants, but sought to prevent
the defendants from marketing paclitaxel in a manner that violates its patents. The defendants asserted that they did not infringe the Company's patents and that
these patents are invalid and unenforceable.
In early 2000, the District Court invalidated most claims of the Company's patents at issue. On April 20, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
affirmed the District Court's summary judgment of the invalidity of all but two claims of the patents at issue. Those two claims relate to the low-dose, three-hour
administration of paclitaxel in which the patient is given a specified regimen of premedicants before the administration of paclitaxel. The appellate court remanded
those two claims to the District Court for further proceedings. In 2001, the Company filed an additional patent infringement suit against another company seeking to
market generic paclitaxel.
In September 2000, one of the defendants received final approval from the FDA for its Abbreviated New Drug Application for paclitaxel and is marketing the
product. The FDA has since announced additional final approvals and sales of additional generic products have begun.
Some of the defendants asserted counterclaims seeking damages for alleged antitrust and unfair competition violations. The Company believed its patents were
valid when it filed the suits, and the counterclaims asserted are believed to be without merit. The lawsuits with all defendants who asserted counterclaims have been
settled, with the defendants agreeing to drop all claims relating to paclitaxel and the Company granting licenses to them under certain paclitaxel patent rights.
Since the filing of the initial patent infringement suits, six private actions have been filed by parties alleging antitrust, consumer protection and similar claims
relating to the Company's actions to obtain and enforce patent rights. The plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment, damages (including treble and/or punitive damages
where allowed), disgorgement and injunctive relief. In June 2002, a group of 32 state attorneys general, the District of Colombia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands
brought similar claims. In September 2000, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) initiated an investigation relating to paclitaxel.On January 7, 2003, the Company announced that it reached agreements in principle that would settle substantially all antitrust litigation surrounding TAXOL®.
The amount of the TAXOL® antitrust settlements is expected to be $135 million, the full amount of which was accrued in the third quarter of 2002. Certain important
terms and conditions of the settlements remain to be finalized, and certain
89
settlements require court approval. Final approval by the state attorneys general in the TAXOL® litigation is contingent upon further agreements relating to the
terms of injunctive relief. Among the provisions remaining to be negotiated are the terms for incorporating certain claimants, including a number of health insurers,
into the existing settlement framework. The Company is in discussions with a number of insurers. Whether they will ultimately join the proposed settlement cannot be
predicted with certainty at this time.
The Company has also reached agreement with the FTC staff on the terms of a consent order that would resolve the FTC's investigation. The proposed consent
order is subject to review and approval by the FTC commissioners.
Other than with respect to the abovementioned proposed settlements, it is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these lawsuits or
reasonably to estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to these lawsuits. If the proposed settlements do not become final or do not resolve all
TAXOL®-related antitrust, consumer protection and similar claims, and if the Company were not to prevail in final, non-appealable determinations of ensuing
litigation, the impact could be material.
BUSPAR LITIGATION
On November 21, 2000, the Company obtained a patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,150,365 ('365 patent), relating to a method of using BUSPAR or buspirone. The
Company timely submitted information relating to the '365 patent to the FDA for listing in an FDA publication commonly known as the "Orange Book", and the FDA
thereafter listed the patent in the Orange Book.
Delisting and Patent Suits. Generic-drug manufacturers sued the FDA and the Company to compel the delisting of the '365 patent from the Orange Book.
Although one district court declined to order the delisting of the '365 patent, another ordered the Company to cause the delisting of the patent from the Orange Book.
The Company complied with the court's order but appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appellate court reversed
the district court that ordered the delisting. Concurrently, the Company sought to enforce the '365 patent in actions against two generic drug manufacturers.
Antitrust Suits. Following the delisting of the '365 patent from the Orange Book, a number of purchasers of buspirone and several generic drug makers filed
lawsuits against the Company alleging that it improperly triggered statutory marketing exclusivity. The plaintiffs claimed that this was a violation of antitrust,
consumer protection and other similar laws. The attorneys general of 36 states and Puerto Rico also filed suit against the Company with parallel allegations. The
plaintiffs have amended their allegations to include charges that a 1994 agreement between the Company and a generic company improperly blocked the entry of
generic buspirone into the market. Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment, damages (including treble and/or punitive damages where allowed), disgorgement and
injunctive relief.
Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) Proceedings. The Judicial Panel on MDL granted the Company's motions to have all of the patent and antitrust cases consolidated
in a single forum. The court before which the buspirone litigations are now pending issued two opinions dated February 14, 2002. In the first opinion, the court found
that the '365 patent does not cover uses of buspirone and therefore is not infringed. In the second opinion, the court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the
federal
90
antitrust and various state law claims. The second opinion allows the claims against the Company to proceed, except as to federal antitrust claims for damages
accrued more than four years before the filing of the complaints.
Government Investigations. The FTC and a number of state attorneys general initiated investigations concerning the matters alleged in the antitrust suits and
discussed above. The Company cooperated in these investigations. A number of attorneys general, but not all of them, filed an action against the Company, as noted
above.
Proposed Settlements. On January 7, 2003, the Company announced that it reached agreements in principle that would settle substantially all antitrust litigation
surrounding BUSPAR. The amount of the BUSPAR settlements is expected to be $535 million, of which $35 million was accrued in the fourth quarter of 2001,
$90 million was accrued in the first quarter of 2002 and $410 million was accrued in the third quarter of 2002. Written settlement agreements with a number of parties
have now been signed. Certain of these settlements require court approval. A number of health insurers have not agreed to the proposed settlement framework.
Whether these cases will ultimately be settled cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.
The Company has also reached agreement with the FTC staff on the terms of a consent order that would resolve the FTC's investigation. The proposed consent
order is subject to review and approval by the FTC commissioners.
Other than with respect to the abovementioned proposed settlements of BUSPAR antitrust litigation, it is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final
outcome of these lawsuits or reasonably to estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to these lawsuits. If the proposed settlements do not become final
or do not resolve all BUSPAR-related antitrust, consumer protection and similar claims, and if the Company were not to prevail in final, non-appealable determinations
of ensuing litigation, the impact could be material.
VANLEV LITIGATION
In April, May and June 2000, the Company, its former chairman of the board and chief executive officer, Charles A. Heimbold, Jr., and its former chief scientific
officer, Peter S. Ringrose, Ph.D., were named as defendants in a number of class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal securities laws and regulations. These
actions have been consolidated into one action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The plaintiff claims that the defendants disseminated
materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material information concerning the safety, efficacy, and commercial viability of its product
VANLEV during the period November 8, 1999 through April 19, 2000.
In May 2002, the plaintiff submitted an amended complaint adding allegations that the Company, its present chairman of the board and chief executive officer,
Peter R. Dolan, its former chairman of the board and chief executive officer, Charles A. Heimbold, Jr., and its former chief scientific officer, Peter S. Ringrose, Ph.D.,
disseminated materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material information concerning the safety, efficacy, and commercial viability ofVANLEV during the period April 19, 2000 through March 20, 2002. A number of related class actions, making essentially the same allegations, were also filed in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. These actions have been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of New
91
Jersey. The plaintiff purports to seek compensatory damages, costs, and expenses on behalf of shareholders.
It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of this litigation or reasonably to estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to
this litigation. If the Company were not to prevail in final, non-appealable determinations of this litigation, the impact could be material.
PLAVIX* LITIGATION
The Company is part of an entity that is a plaintiff in two pending patent infringement lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York, entitled Sanofi-Synthelabo, Sanofi-Synthelabo Inc., and Bristol-Myers Squibb Sanofi Pharmaceuticals Holding Partnership v. Apotex Inc. and Apotex
Corp., 02-CV-2255 (RWS) and Sanofi-Synthelabo, Sanofi-Synthelabo Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Sanofi Pharmaceuticals Holding Partnership v. Dr. Reddy's
Laboratories, LTD, and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., 02-CV-3672 (RWS). The suits are based on U.S. Patent No. 4,847,265, which discloses and claims, among other
things, the hydrogen sulfate salt of clopidogrel, which is marketed as PLAVIX*, and on U.S. Patent No. 5,576,328, which discloses and claims, among other things,
the use of clopidogrel to prevent a secondary ischemic event. Plaintiffs' infringement position is based on defendants' filing of their Abbreviated New Drug
Applications with the FDA, seeking approval to sell generic clopidogrel prior to the expiration of the patents in suit.
It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these lawsuits or reasonably to estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to
these lawsuits. If patent protection for PLAVIX* were lost, the impact on the Company's operations could be material.
OTHER SECURITIES MATTERS
During the period March through May 2002, the Company and a number of its current and former officers were named as defendants in a number of securities
class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal securities laws and regulations. The plaintiffs variously alleged that the defendants disseminated materially false
and misleading statements and failed to disclose material information concerning three different matters: (1) safety, efficacy and commercial viability of VANLEV (as
discussed above), (2) the Company's sales incentives to certain wholesalers and the inventory levels of those wholesalers, and (3) the Company's investment in and
relations with ImClone, and ImClone's product, ERBITUX*. As discussed above, the allegations concerning VANLEV have been transferred to the U.S. District Court
for the District of New Jersey and consolidated with the action pending there. The remaining actions have been consolidated and are pending in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York. The allegations of these remaining actions cover the period January 2001 through April 2002. The plaintiffs seek
compensatory damages, costs and expenses.
In October 2002, a number of the Company's officers, directors, and former directors were named as defendants in a shareholder derivative suit pending in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Company is a nominal defendant. The suit alleges, among other things, violations of the federal
securities laws and breaches of contract and fiduciary duty in connection with the Company's sales incentives to certain wholesalers, the inventory levels of those
wholesalers and its investment in ImClone and ImClone's product ERBITUX*. Two similar actions are pending in New York State court. Plaintiffs seek damages, costs
and attorneys' fees.
92
In April 2002, the SEC initiated an inquiry into the wholesaler inventory issues referenced above, which became a formal investigation in August 2002. In
December 2002, that investigation was expanded to include certain accounting issues, including issues related to the establishment of reserves, and accounting for
certain asset and other sales. In October 2002, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey announced an investigation into the wholesaler
inventory issues referenced above, which has since expanded to cover the same subject matter as the SEC investigation. The Company is cooperating with both of
these investigations. The Company's own investigation is also continuing.
It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these litigations and investigations or reasonably to estimate the possible loss or range of
loss with respect to these litigations and investigations. The Company is producing documents and actively cooperating with these investigations, which
investigations could result in the assertion of criminal and/or civil claims. If the Company were not to prevail in final, non-appealable determinations of these
litigations and investigations, the impact could be material.
ERISA LITIGATION
In December 2002 and in the first quarter of 2003, the Company and others were named as defendants in a number of class actions brought under the federal
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The cases are pending in the U.S. District Courts for the Southern District of New York and the District of New
Jersey. Plaintiffs allege that defendants breached various fiduciary duties imposed by ERISA and owed to participants in the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Savings
and Investment Program (Program), including a duty to disseminate material information concerning: (1) safety data of the Company's product VANLEV, (2) the
Company's sales incentives to certain wholesalers and the inventory levels of those wholesalers, and (3) the Company's investment in and relations with ImClone,
and ImClone's product, ERBITUX*. In connection with the above allegations, plaintiffs further assert that defendants breached fiduciary duties to diversify Program
assets, to monitor investment alternatives, to avoid conflicts of interest, and to remedy alleged fiduciary breaches by co-fiduciaries. In the case pending in the District
of New Jersey, plaintiffs additionally allege violation by defendants of a duty to disseminate material information concerning alleged anti-competitive activities related
to the Company's products BUSPAR, TAXOL®, and PRAVACHOL. Plaintiffs seek to recover losses caused by defendants' alleged violations of ERISA and
attorneys' fees.
It is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these matters or reasonably to estimate possible loss or range of loss with respect to
these lawsuits. If the Company were not to prevail in final, non-appealable determinations of these matters, the impact could be material.
AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICING LITIGATION
The Company, together with a number of other pharmaceutical manufacturers, is a defendant in a series of state and federal actions by private plaintiffs, brought
as purported class actions, and complaints filed by the attorneys general of two states and one county, alleging that the manufacturers' reporting of prices for certain
products has resulted in a false and overstated Average Wholesale Price (AWP), which in turn improperly inflated the reimbursement paid by Medicare beneficiaries,
insurers, state Medicaid programs, medical plans, and others to health care providers who prescribed and administered those products. The federal cases (and many
of the state cases, including the attorney93
general cases, which have been removed to federal courts) have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes and transferred to the United States District Court for the
District of Massachusetts, In re Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale Price Litigation (AWP MultiDistrict Litigation). On September 6, 2002, several of the
private plaintiffs in the AWP MultiDistrict Litigation filed a Master Consolidated Complaint (Master Complaint), which superseded the complaints in their pre-
consolidated constituent cases. The Master Complaint asserts claims under the federal RICO statute and state consumer protection and fair trade statutes. The
Company and the other defendants moved to dismiss the Master Complaint, and motions were heard on January 13, 2003. The Nevada and Montana Attorneys
General have moved to have their respective cases remanded to state court and argument on the motion was held on March 7, 2003. The Company is also a defendant
in related state court proceedings in New York, New Jersey, California, Arizona and Tennessee, and in one federal court proceeding in New York commenced by the
County of Suffolk. The New York and New Jersey state court proceedings are currently stayed. The Company, and the other defendants, have removed, or intend to
remove, the other state court cases to federal court and will seek to have them transferred to the AWP MultiDistrict Litigation. The Company anticipates that the
County of Suffolk case will also be transferred there. Plaintiffs seek damages as well as injunctive relief aimed at manufacturer price reporting practices. These cases
are at a very preliminary stage, and the Company is unable to assess the outcome and any possible effect on its business and profitability, or reasonably to estimate
possible loss or range of loss with respect to these cases.
The Company, together with a number of other pharmaceutical manufacturers, also has received subpoenas and other document requests from various
government agencies seeking records relating to its pricing and marketing practices for drugs covered by Medicare and/or Medicaid. The requests for records have
come from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services
in conjunction with the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, and several states.
The Company is producing documents and actively cooperating with these investigations, which could result in the assertion of criminal and/or civil claims. The
Company is unable to assess the outcome of, or reasonably to estimate possible loss or range of loss with respect to, these investigations, which could include the
imposition of fines, penalties, and administrative remedies.
BREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION
The Company, together with its subsidiary Medical Engineering Corporation (MEC) and certain other companies, remains a defendant in a number of claims and
lawsuits alleging damages for personal injuries of various types resulting from polyurethane-covered breast implants and smooth-walled breast implants formerly
manufactured by MEC or a related company. The vast majority of claims against the Company in direct lawsuits have been resolved through settlements or trial.
Likewise, claims or potential claims against the Company registered in the nationwide class action settlement approved by the Federal District Court in Birmingham,
Alabama (Revised Settlement), have been or will be resolved through the Revised Settlement. The Company has established accruals in respect of breast implant
product liability litigation. The Company believes that any possible loss in addition to the amounts accrued will not be material.

Report of Independent Accountants
To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As described in Note 1, Accounting Policies, the Company in 2001 changed its method of accounting for business combinations and goodwill arising from
transactions consummated subsequent to June 30, 2001 and in 2002 changed its method of accounting for goodwill arising from transactions consummated prior to
July 1, 2001 and for the impairment of long-lived assets.

Item 14. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
The Company restated its consolidated financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2001, including the corresponding 2001 and 2000 interim
periods, and the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2002 and June 30, 2002. For a description of the restatement, see Amendment No. 1 to the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2001 and Amendments No. 1 to the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A for the quarterly periods
ended March 31, 2002 and June 30, 2002.
Within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Form 10-K, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, pursuant to Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.
In making this evaluation, the Company has considered matters relating to its restatement of previously issued financial statements, including the substantial
process that was undertaken to ensure that all material adjustments necessary to correct the previously issued financial statements were recorded. The Company
believes that certain of the restatement adjustments occurred because the Company's control processes and procedures related to the matters underlying such
adjustments were not effective. The Company has also considered the two "material weaknesses" (as defined under
98
standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) relating to its accounting and public financial reporting of significant matters and to
its initial recording and management review and oversight of certain accounting matters, that were identified and communicated to the Company and its Audit
Committee by the Company's independent auditors in connection with their audits of the restatement of previously issued financial statements and the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2002.
In the last year, the Company searched for and hired a new chief financial officer from outside the Company, restaffed the controller position, created a position
of chief compliance officer and changed leadership at the Pharmaceuticals group.
In response to the wholesaler inventory buildup and the other matters identified as restatement adjustments, under the direction of the Audit Committee, in the
last year, senior management has directed that the Company dedicate resources and take steps to strengthen control processes and procedures in order to identify
and rectify past accounting errors and prevent a recurrence of the circumstances that resulted in the need to restate prior period financial statements. The Company
also revised its budgeting process to emphasize a bottom-up approach in contrast to a top-down approach. The Company has implemented a review and certification
process of its annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as well as processes designed to enhance the
monitoring of wholesaler inventories. In addition, the Company is in the process of expanding its business risks and disclosure group, which includes senior
management, including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, and is taking a number of additional steps designed to create a more open
environment for communications and flow of information throughout the Company. The Company continues to identify and implement actions to improve the
effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls, including plans to enhance its resources and training with respect to its financial
reporting and disclosure responsibilities, and to review its actions with its Audit Committee and independent auditors.
Based on this evaluation, the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the evaluation date, such disclosure controls and
procedures were reasonably designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Other than as described above, since the evaluation date by the Company's management of its internal controls, there have not been any significant changes in
the internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect the internal controls.

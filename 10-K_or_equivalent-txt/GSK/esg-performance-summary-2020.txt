work due to illness). The reduced number in 2018 reflects these changes.

Waste ‘Waste generated’ is the operational waste that leaves GSK boundaries. Waste data is based on invoices and waste transfer note data.
‘Beneficial use’ waste is defined as waste sent for recycling, re-use, or
incineration with energy recovery.
‘Non-beneficial use’ waste is defined as waste disposed by either incineration
with no energy recovery or sent to landfill.
Waste to Landfill Waste to landfill includes both hazardous and non-hazardous waste that is Waste to landfill data is based on invoices and waste transfer note
disposed in landfill data.
In some cases, local laws and regulations require certain waste be
sent to landfill. For some types of waste (e.g. asbestos waste) landfill
is the best environmental option.
We include these wastes as waste sent to landfill in our data table,
but we also allow the small number of sites affected to claim ‘zero to
landfill’ status.

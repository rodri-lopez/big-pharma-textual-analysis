Scope 3 emissions from patient use of metered dose inhalers are based on the numbers of

Waste In 2021 we revised our definitions of waste. Waste data is based on invoices and waste transfer note data.
‘Waste generated’ is the operational waste generated
on our sites. Historical waste generated data up to
2020 is the waste generated that that leaves GSK

Waste recovered by a circular route includes all waste
and materials generated on site that is sent for:
– Recycling/reclamation including off-site solvent
recovery
– On and Off-Site Reuse
– Composting or Anaerobic Digestion
– Land treatment resulting in benefit to agriculture
or ecological improvement
In 2021, circular waste does not include any solvent
that was recovered and recycled on-site.

to the Directors of GlaxoSmithKline plc
GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GSK”) commissioned DNV Business Assurance Services UK Limited (“DNV”, “us” or “we”) to conduct a limited assurance
engagement over Selected Information presented in the ESG Performance Report 2021 (the “Report”), for the reporting year ended 31 December
2021.
Our Conclusion: Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have
obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Selected

This conclusion relates only to the Selected Information, and is to be read in the context of this

Our observations and areas for improvement will be raised in a separate report to GSK’s Management. Selected observations are
provided below. These observations do not affect our conclusion set out above.
▪ We identified gaps in the site-level reported distances used for the SalesForce emissions calculation. The approach was retrospectively
